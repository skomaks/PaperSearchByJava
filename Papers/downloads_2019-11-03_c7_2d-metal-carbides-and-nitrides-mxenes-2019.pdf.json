      "heading" : "The Beginning of MXenes: The Story of the Discovery as Told by the Inventors",
      "text" : "Over the 8 years that have passed since the discovery of MXenes [1], there have been more over 1000 papers published by scientists from around the world on the topic. These papers have been cited more than 25,000 times, with more than 1300 citations of our first paper reporting on the first discovered MXene, Ti3C2. The 1st International Conference on MXenes for Energy Applications was held at Jilin University in China on May 25–26 2018 and the second in Beijing in 2019. With this continuous explosive growth of interest in MXenes and the fast increase in the number of research groups working on these fascinating materials, we believe that it is time to document the story of discovery of MXenes by answering the question we have been asked frequently in conferences and meetings: “How did it all start?” And we think that the first book on MXenes is an ideal venue for this story (Fig. 1).\nAlbert Einstein said: “If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?” which is usually very true. The story started at Drexel University where Professor Michel Barsoum’s group has been studying a unique family of machinable layered transition metal carbides and nitrides ceramics called MAX phases for about two decades [2, 3]. The MAX phases are unique in that they combine some of the best attributes of ceramics and metals. For example, they are metallically conductive and machinable. Some, e.g., Ti2AlC, have high elastic moduli, are relatively light, and are creep, fatigue, and oxidation resistant, like ceramics. The MAX phases are comprised blocks of transition metal carbide/nitride “Mn+1Xn” octahedra bonded together by an atomically thin “A” metal layer (e.g., Al, Si, Sn, In, Ga).\nAt the same Materials Science and Engineering Department, Professor Yury Gogotsi’s group has been studying the synthesis of carbon [4] and carbides [5] for electrochemical energy storage and other applications. Many of these nanomaterials were produced by selective etching (extraction) of metals from carbides, including\nvii\nviii Preface\nMAX phases, forming silicon carbide (SiC) nanoplatelets [6], carbide-derived carbons [7, 8], and graphene and carbon nanotubes [9].\nIn responding to a call for proposals from the US Department of Energy searching for alternative Li-ion battery (LIB) anode materials beyond graphite, particularly Si-based ones, Gogotsi and Barsoum decided to work together on a proposal to use MAX phases to replace graphite. The rationale behind this idea was that many A elements present in MAX phases (e.g., Si or Sn) are known to alloy with Li to yield in high gravimetric capacity anode. The fact that the MAX phases were layered, were excellent conductors of electricity, and were more oxidation-resistant than graphite were also important considerations. What limits the utilization of these metals in LIBs is mainly their significant volume change during electrochemical cycling, leading to anode pulverization and loss of contact between the active materials and the current collectors, which usually leads to rapid electrode degradation. In the MAX phases, which are layered compounds like graphite, the monoatomic A element layers are sandwiched between stiff and electrically conductive MX blocks. Thus, they were expected to be more stable for a larger number of cycles than when pure A elements used. Density functional theory calculations conducted by one of Gogotsi’s PhD students, Murat Kurtoglu, suggested that the energy barrier for Li insertion into Ti3SiC2 was sufficiently low to make the Li insertion process feasible, and the proposal was funded for 4 years. At that time, Michael Naguib was a first-year PhD student in Barsoum’s group, and he was assigned to work on this project under the co-supervision of Barsoum and Gogotsi.\nDuring the initial screening of a large number of MAX phase powders as battery anodes, Naguib found that any measured Li-ion capacity could be attributed to the metallic impurities in the MAX phase samples, which vanish after purification (e.g.,\nPreface ix\netching the samples in hydrochloric acid) decreasing the MAX phase capacity to negligible values. There were a couple of hypotheses for why the MAX phases did not meet the high expectations as anodes for LIBs. The first hypothesis was the large particle size with an average in the tens of microns range – very large for Sior Sn-based anode materials which are known to show good performance only at the nanoscale. Thus, the team decided that reducing the particle size of MAX phase might be necessary to unlock its capability for hosting Li. The second hypothesis was that the A element occupying the gallery between the MX blocks hinders Li insertion at the potentials achievable in conventional battery electrolytes. To address the first hypothesis, high-energy milling was conducted to reduce the particle size from more than 10 microns to around 1 micron. However, the performance was not significantly improved at that time. To investigate the second hypothesis, a series of experiments were conducted to create vacancies in the A layer of MAX phases. The team brainstormed and tried a variety of chemistries that could be used to selectively remove Si and other A elements from MAX phases. For example, it was known that treating MAX phase in molten salts (e.g., cryolite) created vacancies in the A layer [10], but since the treatment was carried out at higher temperatures, the removal of the A atoms was accompanied by reorganization of the carbide layers to form rock salt structure [11], which didn’t show any measurable electrochemical activity for Li.\nOne of the techniques used for synthesis of fully dense MAX phase is hot isostatic pressing, and the product of this synthesis is encapsulated in glass. A hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution was typically used to dissolve this glassy phase. As part of the inherited knowhow within Barsoum’s group, students were warned from soaking the pressed parts longer than what was needed to dissolve the glass, because sometimes the dense parts could disintegrate into powder. In an attempt to achieve both, size reduction of the MAX phase particles down to single grains and partial/full etching of the A layers, Naguib suggested and used HF. The rationale behind the HF selection was that it could etch the grain boundaries of the MAX phases and disintegrate the large multi-grain particles into smaller grains. Also, HF is one of few etchants that can etch titanium oxide, which is usually present as a thin protective layer on the surface of Ti-containing MAX phases. Etching or breaking through that oxide layer is necessary to react the A layers in the MAX phases.\nSince initial attempts to etch Ti3SiC2 in various etchants were unsuccessful, the second MAX phase powder immersed in HF was Ti2SnC. During the reaction of this powder (−400 mesh) with 50% HF at room temperature for ≈ 12 h, a strange sound was heard emanating from the reaction vessel. Upon closer inspection, the noise was traced to the sound of metal beads hitting each other, a sound not unlike the cabasa instrument. After 24 h, the reaction was stopped, and the products were washed. Large metallic beads (~1–3 mm), in addition to a small amount of powder, were observed. As shown in Fig. 2a, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of this mixture showed the presence of metallic tin, in addition to unreacted Ti2SnC. The weight loss after the reaction was ~ 40%. Considering that the Sn content in Ti2SnC is ∼52 wt.%, it was reasonable to conclude that both Ti and C dissolved in the acid, and the free Sn agglomerated forming metal beads.\nx Preface\nImmersion of commercial Ti2AlC powder from Kanthal, Sweden, which had licensed the MAX technology from Drexel University, in 50% HF at room temperature, resulted in an exothermic reaction accompanied with large amounts of gas evolved. When the reaction was stopped after 5 minutes by adding 300 mL of DI water to the reaction vessel, the color of the resulting powder after washing and drying turned much darker (the color turned from dark gray to black). The weight loss reached ~ 90%. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the powder after the reaction showed significantly less Al than in the stoichiometric Ti2AlC. In addition to Ti, Al, and C, O and F were detected with the following the atomic ratios: Ti:Al:C:O: F were ~ 1.0:0.06:0.6:0.6:1.2, respectively. Also, the C to Ti ratio was higher than in the stoichiometric Ti2AlC. However, quantitative EDS analysis of carbon is tricky, because C may come from sources other than the sample itself. The first TEM images of this powders were taken by Gogotsi’s postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Junjie Niu, who used to study graphene, and his first reaction was “this is graphene, not a MAX phase” as the powder exhibited a graphene-like 2D morphology, while EDS analysis confirmed that the 2D sheets consisted of Ti, C, O, and F.\nFigure 2b shows that all the XRD peaks related to Ti2AlC vanished after the HF treatment. Only peaks of TiC, present as an impurity in the as-received MAX phases, were identified at 2θ = 35.98◦, 41.8◦, and 60.6◦. Those low-intensity peaks can be observed in the XRD pattern of the as-received powder (bottom pattern in Fig. 2b). The post-etching weak TiC peaks seen in XRD diffraction patterns belonged to the TiC present in the starting material. It was only after cold pressing of the etched powder at 1 GPa, that new, broad XRD peaks at 2θ ~ 8.49◦, 17.96◦, 27.56◦, and 36.43◦ appeared (top pattern in Fig. 2b). Since\nPreface xi\nthose peaks appeared only after pressing, it was reasonable to conclude that this phase had a certain preferred orientation. Assuming a hexagonal structure (the same as the MAX phase), the preferred orientation would be along the {000l} plane, which implied those peaks would correspond to (0002), (0004), (0006), and (0008) reflections. The calculated average c-lattice parameter, c-LP, based on this assumption is 19.92 Å. This c-LP value is closer to the c-LPs of the Ti3AlC2 (18.487 Å) [12] rather than Ti2AlC (13.364 Å) [13]. This observation, together with the fact that only 10 wt.% of the material remained after the reaction, which is close to the amount of Ti3AlC2 that existed as a secondary impurity phase in the as-received Ti2AlC powder, directed Naguib’s attention toward the former. In other words, it was assumed that under those conditions, all the Ti2AlC dissolved and the leftover was the product of reacting Ti3AlC2 with HF. To prove this conjecture, we decided to start with Ti3AlC2 instead of Ti2AlC. When −400 mesh Ti3AlC2 powder was immersed in 50% HF, the reaction was less exothermic than in the case of Ti2AlC. Bubbles, presumed to be H2, were observed during the etching, suggesting a chemical reaction. After 2 h, the reaction was stopped, and the powder was washed using DI water. The weight loss was negligible. EDS analysis of the resulting powders showed a significant reduction in the Al content and a concomitant increase in the O and F concentrations. The Ti:Al:C:O:F atomic ratio was ~ 3.0:0.1:1.4:1.7:1.9. This implies that the Al was selectively etched; the Ti3C2 layers were released and terminated by oxygen (i.e., O and OH) and/or fluorine, F, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy by Gogotsi’s student, Min Heon. Raman analysis conducted by Dr. Volker Presser, Gogotsi’s postdoc, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy performed by Swedish colleagues of Barsoum, Dr. Jun Lu and Prof. Lars Hultman, completed the characterization of this 2D material, and the first paper announcing the discovery was written [1].\nWhen it was discovered that the A element from MAX phase was removed, it was suggested to label the produced material as MXene to emphasize the loss of the A element from the MAX phase and its 2D morphology, similar to graphene. This moniker has since been universally accepted, and MXenes are now full-fledged members of the 2D material world. Soon thereafter, we showed that by tuning the etching conditions, other MXenes (viz., Ti2C, Ta4C3, TiNbC, V1.5Cr1.5C2, Ti3CN) could be produced. In other words, we showed that MXenes are actually a large – and growing – family of 2D materials [14–16]. The current number is more than 30.\nAfter etching the Al layers to form MXenes, electrodes made with the etched material showed promise as anodes for LIBs especially at high cycling rates. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the US DOE BATT program that supported the first few years of MXene research. This project resulted in an entire family of 2D materials which, as this book shows, exhibit unique properties and promising performances in numerous applications.\nDrexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA Michel W.

      "text" : "Group 4–6 transition metal carbides and nitrides were explored in the twentieth century as high-temperature, hard, chemically stable, and wear-resistant materials [1]. Exploration of their energy storage applications started with the discovery of their catalytic behavior in the 1970s [2], and since then several nanostructure designs have been proposed, taking small steps to enhance the surface area and performance of transition metal carbides and nitrides [3, 4]. The breakthrough in the field happened in 2011 by the discovery of the first two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) that led to a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes (pronounced “maxines”) [5, 6]. Since then, MXenes have become a large and quickly growing family of 2D materials.\nMXene materials have a formula of Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal (Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, or W), X is carbon or nitrogen, and n = 1–3 [7, 8]. The transition metals are marked in blue in Fig. 1.1 (periodic table). T represents the surface termination groups that are mostly = O, −F, and −OH, and x in Tx represents the number of surface functionalities. There are also few reports on Ti3C2Tx MXene with surface termination of −Cl [9, 10]. The experimentally reported surface terminations are marked in yellow in Fig. 1.1. The 2D sheets have a thickness in the range of 1 nm, which can be controlled by changing the n in MXenes from M2XTx, to M3X2Tx, and M4X3Tx.\nTo date, most MXenes (25 out of 29 of the published ones) have been made by selective etching of the Al layers from MAX phases (Fig. 1.2). MAX phases are\nB.

Gogotsi\nlayered ternary carbides and nitrides in which Mn+1Xn layers are bonded together with layers of an A element [11]. The A elements are groups 13–16 of the periodic table. Recent studies have shown transition metals of groups 8–12 of the periodic table (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ir, and Au) can also become the A layer of MAX phases, either in the form of solid solutions (marked with a red “SS” box) or as pure A elements (marked with a red “1A” box). All experimentally explored A elements in MAX phases are marked in red in Fig. 1.1. In MAX phases, which were first reported in the 1930s to the 1960s and then were rediscovered in the late 1990s and labeled as MAX phases [11], metallic bonding between the M-A layers keeps the Mn+1Xn layers together and is usually weaker than the M-X bonds, which makes the selective etching of the A layers possible (read Chap. 2). Figure 1.1 shows the M, X, A, and T elements reported to date for the MAX phases and MXenes. Mn-containing MAX phases have been reported [12, 13]; however, MXene with pure Mn as the M has not been synthesized from a MAX phase yet. A lutetium-containing MAX phase (Lu2SnC) has been synthesized adding the possibility of lanthanides as MAX phase components [14].\nThe rapid development of MXene chemistry and interest in synthesizing new MXenes has excited the MAX community and led to the discovery of the new subfamilies of MAX phases, namely, in-plane and out-of-plane ordered double transition metal carbides, which will be discussed in Chap. 3. When two transition metals combined (mostly a heavy transition metal with a light one), ordered structures of MAX phases form instead of solid solutions. In the out-of-plane\n1 Introduction to 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides (MXenes) 5\nordered structure, two layers of a transition metal are sandwiching one or two layers of another M in the carbide structure, for example, Mo2TiAlC2 and Mo2Ti2AlC3. By selective etching the Al atomic layers, ordered double transition metal MXenes have been made (marked in red in Fig. 1.3). In the M2AC structure, where only two layers of M are available, in-plane ordering has been reported, in which the basal planes consist of separate rows of two types of M elements, for example, (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC, and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC (read Chap. 3). The inplane MAX phases can be selectively etched to become two different types of MXenes: by selective etching of the Al layers, in-plane ordered double transition metal MXenes can form, such as (Mo2/3Y1/3)2CTx (marked in red in Fig. 1.3); or by selective etching of the lighter transition metal (e.g., Sc or Y) with Al layers, ordered divacancy MXenes can be synthesized, such as Mo1.33CTx and W1.33CTx (marked in pink in Fig. 1.3). The latter MXene phases do not follow the general formula of Mn+1XnTx since they contain about 33% atomic vacancies in the transition metal layers and have a M1.33XTx formula. These phases and their resulting MXenes will be discussed in Chap. 3. Beyond MAX phases, other layered ternary carbides have been also selectively etched to make MXenes. In such carbides, either two layers of an A element (Mo2Ga2C) or layers of A-element carbides (e.g., Al3C3 in Zr3Al3C5 and (Al,Si)4C4 in Hf3(Al,Si)4C6) separate the Mn+1Xn layers. The latter carbides are members of a large family of (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 with more than 30\n6 B. Anasori and Y. Gogotsi\ncompounds. Mo2CTx, Zr3C2Tx, and Hf3C2Tx MXenes have been made from these non-MAX precursors as discussed in Chap. 4.\nUnlike most of the 2D materials precursors, in which van der Waals bonding holds the 2D sheets together, the 3D layered MXene precursors of ternary carbides and nitrides, including MAX phases, have primary bonding between the layers either by the A-element or AmCm−1 layers. Consequently, only chemical exfoliation methods have been used to make MXenes. Figure 1.2 shows a schematic of MXene precursors and the top-down selective etching to synthesize M2XTx, M3X2Tx, and M4X3Tx MXenes. To date, primarily fluoride-containing acidic solutions have been used for MXene synthesis, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or a mix of lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Fluoride-free etching routes are also possible via electrochemical selective etching, for example, etching Ti2AlC in chloride-containing solutions [9, 10]. A computational analysis of the possibility of exfoliation of different MXenes is presented in Chap. 14. The selective chemical\n1 Introduction to 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides (MXenes) 7\netching makes the large-scale production of MXenes easily feasible, which is a significant advantage over several other 2D materials. All top-down selective etching methods and etchants, as well as large-scale production of MXenes, are discussed in Chap. 5. To date, 28 out of 29 MXenes (except for Mo2N) have been synthesized via the top-down method as shown in Fig. 1.2. There are more than 60 possible stoichiometric MXene compositions (Fig. 1.3), as well as an infinite number of solid solutions. Their stability and properties have been explored via computational studies as discussed in Chap. 14.\nBottom-up methods are also available to make surface-termination-free 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, and these methods have been the least explored for MXenes. The main issue is the formation of bulk and non-2D carbides. Very thin (down to 2–3-nm-thick) Mo2C and W2C have been deposited via chemical vapor deposition, as well as pulsed laser deposition. The salt-templating method that is used to form transition metal oxides and transform them to nitrides and carbides is another bottom-up route as discussed in Chap. 6.\nBecause the top-down selective chemical etching is the main method of MXene synthesis [8, 15], MXene properties are significantly synthesis- and processingdependent. In Ti3C2Tx, the most studied MXene, surface termination (Tx) consists of OH, O, and F in different ratios, depending on the etching processing (e.g., etchant composition and temperature) as well as processing conditions such as washing steps and delamination, and even post-synthesis steps and storage conditions (temperature and environment), as discussed in Chaps. 7, 8, and 11. In general, an etchant with a higher concentration of HF leads to a higher fluorine content on MXene surfaces. Additionally, a more aggressive etchant increases the number of defects in MXene flakes. Etching conditions even change the morphology of the etched multilayered powder. For example, concentrated HF usually leads to accordion-like shape of particles, which is not observed under milder etching conditions. The surface terminations also depend on the M (transition metal). For example, Mo2CTx has minimal fluorine terminations compared to Ti3C2Tx, despite the fact that a higher concentration of HF is needed to produce Mo2CTx [16].\nAfter selective etching of the A-group element layers (Al, Si) or Al/Si carbide layers from the precursor (Fig. 1.2), MXene multilayered powder is made. While the multilayered powder particles have been used for applications in adsorption and Liion batteries (Chaps. 19, 20 and 22), to fully benefit from the 2D nature of MXenes, delamination to single-layered flakes is a required step. Intercalation is needed to separate and delaminate MXene sheets. Different metal cations and organic molecules have been used as intercalants either via chemical or electrochemical reactions. The reported intercalated metal cations, such as Li+, Na+, Ca2+, and Al3+, are marked in green in the periodic table in Fig. 1.1. MXenes have been also used to adsorb heavy metal ions, such as Pb and Pd, as these ions can intercalate MXenes. Many other metal cations can be intercalated into MXenes. Because the M-X bonds are strong and short, ions can only penetrate between the MXene sheets and not in MXene flakes. The interlayer spacing of MXenes and their properties, including electrical, electrochemical, and mechanical, can be controlled by the intercalated cation sizes and charges, as discussed in Chaps. 9 and 10. MXene delamination can be done in different solutions using various cation\n8 B. Anasori and Y. Gogotsi\nintercalants. For example, by the use of a mixture of HCl with lithium fluoride (LiF), it is possible to etch the precursor and delaminate MXene by raising the pH during the washing steps. In other words, no additional intercalant is needed for delamination. When pure HF is used, however, organic molecules such as tertiary amines (tetrabutyl- and tetramethyl-amonium hydroxides) are mixed with multilayer MXene for intercalation and delamination. Recently, mixed acids such as HF-HCl have been used for etching, followed by addition of salts such as lithium chloride (LiCl) for easier intercalation and delamination [20]. A full description of MXenes delamination process is available in Chap. 11.\nMXenes have a unique combination of properties that make them promising materials for a variety of applications as shown in Fig. 1.4. The as-synthesized MXenes are hydrophilic and can be dispersed in water and a variety of organic solvents such as ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, and propylene carbonate [17]. MXene zeta potentials are negative in the range of −30 to −80 mV, which is a function of solution pH and MXene compositions as discussed in Chap. 10. The high negative zeta potential makes MXene colloidal solutions stable and gives the opportunity to fabricate MXene films and patterns using almost any method applicable to inks. MXene films have been made via filtration, spray coating, spin coating, dip coating, and printing. Additionally, MXene colloids can be mixed with different nanomaterials and polymer solutions to fabricate hybrid and composite structures. Ti3C2Tx can be mixed with functionalized positively charged carbon nanotubes or graphene to fabricate self-assembled hybrid films. These structures, their fabrication methods, and properties are discussed in Chap. 12. There are a few studies that showed MXene can initiate polymerization when in contact with certain monomers, such as pyrrole and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT). The organic-MXene interactions and hybrid structures are discussed in more details in Chap. 13.\nThe oxidation stability of MXenes depends on their composition, structure (flake size and concentration of defects), morphology (e.g., single- or multilayered flakes, powder, or films), and storage conditions (e.g., colloidal solution, dried films, in vacuum or air). Since MXenes are made via solution processing, it is common to store the 2D flakes in water or organic solvents as colloidal solution (ink) [17]. When stored as solutions, MXene flake size as well as liquid medium type, dissolved oxygen, and temperature has large impacts on the oxidation rate [18]. It has been shown recently that water and MXene hydrolysis play a major role in MXene degradation. For example, when Ti3C2Tx is stored in anhydrous isopropanol in ambient conditions (with dissolved oxygen), it shows almost no degradation up to 30 days [19]. However, if Ti3C2Tx is stored in aqueous solution, dissolved oxygen leads to its oxidation in a few days. In the case of aqueous solution storage, MXene degradation can be delayed by storing under argon with minimum dissolved oxygen in the water and lower temperatures as discussed in Chap. 16. Removal of MXene from water by deposition methods, such as spray or spin coating or filtration, significantly improves its stability in air for up to months. For example, a 5-μm-thick filtered film of Ti3C2Tx was stable up to 30 days of storage at room temperature in air [18].\n1 Introduction to 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides (MXenes) 9\nMXenes have a unique combination of properties, and although over the past 8 years we have learned a lot about them, there is still a significant amount of work needed to fully understand MXene properties. All bare MXenes are metallic similar to their MAX precursors. However, upon surface terminations, MXenes have been predicted to be either metals or semiconductors. So far, all the experimental measurements suggested metallic behavior. Some MXenes have been predicted to be topological insulators. In general, MXene chemistry (M, X, and T), their structure (M2XTx, M3X2Tx, M4X3Tx), and the position of the surface termination can affect the electronic properties, which are explored in detail in Chaps. 14 and 16. At ~ 10,000 S/cm, the electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx film is one of the highest among the solution-processed nanomaterials, making it the best material for electromagnetic interference shielding (Chap. 21) and antenna applications [20]. Experimental electrical conductivity values of different MXenes are presented in Chap. 16. Additionally, there are several predictions about room temperature magnetic MXenes, such as Cr2COxF2−x and Ti2MnC2Tx, as discussed in Chap. 15.\nMechanical properties of MXenes are outstanding but have not been explored enough. The measured 2D elastic modulus of single-layer Ti3C2Tx measured via atomic force microscopy indentation is 326 ± 29 N/m, which corresponds to a Young’s modulus of 330 ± 30 GPa and makes Ti3C2Tx MXene the third strongest 2D sheet characterized to date, after perfect graphene and hexagonal boron nitride [21]. Additionally, Ti3C2Tx Young’s modulus is the highest among the solutionprocessed 2D materials, exceeding those of transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene oxide as discussed in Chap. 16. The measured values are from etched and delaminated MXene, which contains defects (such as titanium vacancies) in the individual MXene sheets. Density functional theory and molecular dynamic (MD) studies have suggested that the elastic properties in MXene basal planes should be quite high (c11 in the range of 500–800 GPa). Recent MD simulation has shown that changing the number of M layers (e.g., M2C to M4C3) significantly changes the bending rigidity of the 2D flakes [22]. These values suggest a great potential of 2D MXenes for fabrication of multifunctional nacre-like composites for a variety of applications including structural composites, coatings, and wearables.\nOptical properties of MXene flakes have been explored since 2016, and several applications, such as mode-locked lasers, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and photothermal therapy, have emerged. A ~ 1-nm-thick Ti3C2Tx MXene absorbs about 3% of visible light (at 550 nm wavelength). There is a significant optical tunability of MXenes by changing their chemistry (e.g., from Ti2CTx to V2CTx) that changes the absorption spectra as discussed in Chap. 17.\nElectrochemical properties of MXenes have been extensively studied. Almost 50% of MXene publications to date are on energy-related topics (Fig. 1.4) as discussed in Chaps. 18, 19, 20, 23 and 25. MXenes have a unique combination of properties that make them desirable for energy storage applications:\n(i) The surface terminations, more specifically −O, create transition metal oxidelike surfaces, which are redox active.\n10 B. Anasori and Y. Gogotsi\n(ii) MXenes possess high electrical conductivity. This conductivity provides fast transport of electrons to the electrochemically active sites.\n(iii) MXene 2D nature and the ease of cation intercalation lead to fast ion transport.\nThe nature of charge storage changes depending on the electrolyte. MXenes show primary double-layer capacitive behavior in aqueous neutral and alkaline electrolytes, while it becomes pseudocapacitive in acidic electrolytes, resulting in ultrahigh capacitance values up to 450 F g−1 (1500 F cm−3) as presented in Chap. 18. Because of the 2D nature of MXenes, they tend to restack and make access\n1 Introduction to 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides (MXenes) 11\nof ions to the surfaces of 2D sheets difficult, particularly in electrodes beyond few μm thickness. Various methods have been explored to overcome this challenge. For example, at 0.2 mm thickness, electrodes made of vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx kept their high capacitance of >200 F g−1 up to 2 V s−1 scan rate in 3 M sulfuric acid electrolyte. As discussed earlier, MXenes can accommodate various metal cations, which led to the exploration of Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, and Al-ion batteries, as discussed in Chaps. 19 and 20.\nBeyond energy-related topics, several new applications of MXenes have emerged, including electromagnetic interference and antennas (Chap. 21) and environmental (Chap. 22.), sensor (Chap. 24), optical (Chaps. 17 and 25), and biomedical (Chap. 26) ones. The starting years for each application of MXenes are shown in the second ring of the pie chart in Fig. 1.4. Because of the promising performance in these applications, MXenes have become key materials in many areas. For example, the first studies on electromagnetic interference shielding were published in the second half of 2016, and since then Ti3C2Tx is known as the best 2D material for EMI shielding [23, 24]. Electronic and mechanical/structural properties and applications are among the very first that were explored for MXenes. However, most of the published studies are computational, and very little has been done experimentally. Additionally, about 70% of publications on MXenes deal with Ti3C2Tx, shown in the third ring of the pie chart in Fig. 1.4. Even though there are more than 60 MXene compositions known to date and about half of them have been synthesized, only ~30% of publications have been dedicated to them. These numbers show a great potential of MXenes for numerous applications.\nAcknowledgments We are thankful to various programs at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research (DMR), Ceramics Program for their support of MXenes research throughout the years."

These phases remained largely unexplored with only sporadic work until the mid-1990s, when Barsoum and El-Raghy [2] synthesized relatively phase-pure samples of Ti3SiC2 and revealed it to be a material with a remarkable combination of metallic and ceramic properties: good electrical and thermal conductivity, machinablility, and resistance to thermal shock and oxidation. They later discovered Ti4AlN3, making it clear that these phases shared a basic structure and leading to the introduction of the nomenclature “Mn+1AXn phases” (n = 1, 2, or 3) or “MAX phases,” where M is a transition metal, A is an A-group element, and X is C and/or N [3, 4].\nThe remarkable properties of the MAX phases originate from their layered structure and the mixed metallic-covalent nature of the strong M-X bonds together with M-A bonds that are relatively weak. Because of this unusual property combination, the MAX phases are being considered for a wide range of applications, such as hightemperature structural applications, protective coatings, sensors, electrical contacts, microelectromechanical systems, and many more. Currently, pantographs for some of the high-speed trains in China are made with a MAX phase.\nM. W.

Within a couple of years of the first report, MXenes have already become established as a class of 2D materials with remarkable possibilities for composition variations and property tuning.\nThis chapter introduces the MAX phases, making the connection as precursors to MXene. The chapter is largely based on – and summarizes – previous reviews [3, 6, 7] and a book [8]; we refer the reader to these sources for an in-depth treatment of the fundamentals of the MAX phases. Quite recently, Sokol et al. catalogued all MAX phases known to date and showed that they number over 150 (including solid solutions and ordered quaternary phases). The interested reader is referred to that paper for the list [9]. Furthermore, good introductory treatments of the MAX phases are given in several brief overviews [4, 9–11]. Specific subtopics are treated in a number of focused reviews, for example, the relation to related layered phases [12–14], summaries Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2 [15–17], tribology [18], magnetism [19], spectroscopy and electronic structure [20], elastic and mechanical properties [21], and oxidation [22]."

      "text" : "As defined by Barsoum [3], the MAX phases have the general formula Mn+1AXn (n = 1, 2, or 3). The different MAX stoichiometries are often referred to as 211 (n = 1), 312 (n = 2), and 413 (n = 3). The M elements are transition metals mainly from groups 3 (Sc), 4 (Ti, Zr, Hf), 5 (V, Nb, Ta), and 6 (Cr and Mo). The A element is primarily from groups 13 to 16 of the periodic table (Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn,\n2 The Mn+1AXn Phases: The Precursors for MXenes 17\nP, As, S, etc.), and the X element is C and/or N. The label “A” comes from the old American nomenclature for the periodic table (see below). Figure 2.1 shows a periodic table of the elements with the elements that have been reported in the MAX phases highlighted.\nFigure 2.2a, b, and c sketch the hexagonal unit cells of the 211, 312, and 413 MAX phases. The unit cells consist of M6X octahedra, e.g., Ti6C, interleaved with layers of A elements (e.g., Si or Ge). The distinction between the 211, 312, and 413 phases is the different number of M layers separating the A layers. The M6X edgesharing octahedral building block in the MAX phases is the same as in the rock salt binary carbides and nitrides, MX. In the 312 and 413 MAX structures, there are two different M sites, those adjacent to A and those not. These sites are referred to as M(1) and M(2), respectively. In the 413 structure, there are also two nonequivalent X sites, X(1) and X(2). In all cases the MX layers are twinned with respect to each other and separated by the A layer which acts as mirror plane. Figure 2.2d is a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image acquired along the [112 0] zone axis of Ti3SiC2, showing the twinning and the resulting characteristic “zig-zag” stacking of the MAX phases. The MAX structures are anisotropic: the lattice parameters are typically around a ~ 3 Å and c ~ 13 Å (for 211 phases), c ~ 18 Å (for 312 phases), and c ~ 23–24 Å (for 413 phases).\nTable 2.1 lists the structural parameters of the basic MAX structures. The space group is P63/mmc. Table 2.2 lists a noncomprehensive list of known MAX phases, together with their densities and lattice parameters. A much more comprehensive\n18 M. W. Barsoum and P. Eklund\nlist can be found in Ref. [9]. For the 211 structure, there are three unique atoms; in the 312, there are four; in the 413, there are five. For the 211 phases, there is only one polymorph (Fig. 2.2a). In the 312 case, there are two, α (Fig. 2.2b) and β (not shown). For the 413 phases, there are three, α (Fig. 2.2c), β (not shown), and γ (not shown). The coordinates of all the atoms are listed in Table 2.1 for the\n2 The Mn+1AXn Phases: The Precursors for MXenes 19\n20 M. W. Barsoum and P. Eklund\nvarious polymorphs.

The Greek letters refer to the X positions corresponding to their Roman letter counterparts, i.e., α is an A site, β is a B site, etc.\nFinally, it should be noted that in principle, the value of n may be higher than 3, forming “514” phases and higher. However, there are only a few examples of such phases, e.g., (Ti0.5, Nb0.5)5AlC4, and none to date have been synthesized in pure form [23].\nB γ A c A γ B a B γ A c A γ B . . .

In early MAX-phase literature, a misconception sometimes occurred that the terms “H phase” and “Hägg phase” would be synonyms. However, the “H” in “H phases” is not an abbreviation for “Hägg.” In fact [25], the “H phases or Cr2AlC-type” are non-Hägg-like phases. The correct sense of “Hägg phases” is carbides, nitrides, borides, and hydrides with close-packed or hexagonal metal-atom arrays where C, N, B, or H occupies interstitial octahedral or trigonal sites [25, 26].

In contrast, solid-solution hardening effects are generally not very pronounced, and there are indications that observed hardening in a few cases of MAX-phase solid-solution samples would not be a pure solid-solution hardening effect, but rather a microstructural effect caused by grain-size differences [41].

These phases consist of alternating “211” and “312” half-unit cells, to form a “523” phase, or alternating “312” and “413” half-unit cells to form a “725” phase. This stacking needs to be repeated three times to form a complete unit cell, meaning that the c axis is three times the average unit cell of the two constituents and that the symmetry of the P63/mmc space group is broken. Initially, it was believed that these intergrown phases could form only as minority or intermediate phases, primarily in thin films. However, in 2011, Scabarozi et al. demonstrated that Ti7Si2C5 can be synthesized as phase-pure epitaxial thin films [45].\nFigure 2.3 (from Scabarozi et al. [45]) shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Ti7Si2C5 structure where the alternating “312” and “413” layers can be seen. Somewhat later, Ti5Al2C3 was synthesized as majority phase in bulk samples [46]. Initially, the structure was reported as belonging to the P3m1 space\ngroup [46, 47], but it was soon shown that the same structure can be described with a higher symmetry in the R-3 m space group [48] (refer to Table 2.1 in Ref. [49] for the structural model of Ti5Al2C3). It should also be noted that there is an erroneous report [50] on Ti5Al2C3 claiming a different structure, with space group P63/mmc, but this proposed structure is inconsistent with the experimentally observed one [47].\nFurthermore, it should be noted that a “624” intergrown phase, i.e., with a structure of alternating “211” and “413” layers, has been observed in the Ti-Al-N MAX-phase system [51]."

This occurs because of reversible substitution/intercalation of Au in the MAX phase, with Au diffusing in and out of the A layer without any substantial change of the metal carbide, e.g., Ti3C2, layers. In the case of Ti3AuC2 on SiC, a highly stable Ohmic contact is formed.\nAn example is shown in Fig. 2.4, showing that after 10 h atmospheric annealing at 600 ◦C, the Si layers in Ti3SiC2 have been completed replaced with Au to form Ti3AuC2. This ability to insert/intercalate noble metals in inherently nanolaminated structures appears to be a general phenomenon. From the governing thermodynamics, general guidelines could be suggested for identifying materials systems where this type of reaction may occur [53–57]. The metal to be introduced should be inert toward the ceramic-based (carbide, nitride, oxide) layers and exhibit negative heat of mixing with the initial A element (Si, Al, Ca, etc.) in a liquid phase or two-phase liquid/solid region at the annealing temperature. Similar phenomena can also yield Cu incorporation predominantly on the A site [58–60].\n2 The Mn+1AXn Phases: The Precursors for MXenes 25"

      "text" : "Here, we summarize the most important methods for bulk synthesis of MAX phases. The seminal 1996 paper by Barsoum and El-Raghy [2] used hot isostatic pressing (HIP) to obtain >95% phase-pure bulk Ti3SiC2. While hot pressing has remained an important method for bulk synthesis [61–66] for research purposes, pressureless sintering [67–73] is most likely more commercially viable. Other methods for processing of bulk MAX phases are variations of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis [74–78] and solid-liquid reaction synthesis [79–81]. Numerous studies have also been done on spark plasma sintering [82–86], a technique more appropriately named pulse discharge sintering [87–92] since it does not actually involve any plasma. Further approaches to bulk synthesis include threedimensional printing [93]; the use of Al and Sn, respectively, as catalysts for growth of Ti3SiC2 and Ti3AlC2 [60, 94, 95]; and design of crystalline precursors for solidphase reaction synthesis [96].\nIn terms of MXenes, and unless one is interested in making dense samples, the preferred technique is to simply mix powders with the correct stoichiometry and heat them up in vaccum or an inert atmosphere, preferably Ar, to temperatures that vary between 1350 and 1600 ◦C depending on the MAX phase desired. It is important to keep the oxygen content as low as possible. Since the vast majority of MAX phases used to make MXenes are Al-based and Al has a tendency to evaporate at these high temperatures, an excess of Al is usually required in the initial mix. The excess amount will vary between different MAX phases but hovers around 10 at.%. After reaction, a lightly sintered porous billet is produced that is typically milled or crushed to make the MAX powder. It is recommended the latter be sieved through a fine mesh to ensure that larger particles are removed."

      "text" : "This section summarizes thin-film processing of MAX phases, focusing on chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), and solid-state reaction synthesis. We only treat atomistic techniques, and not, for example, spraying techniques or other methods for growth of thick coatings. Furthermore, for discussions of film-growth mechanisms and substrate selection, quality, and cleaning, the\n26 M. W. Barsoum and P. Eklund\nreader is referred to earlier reviews and articles [6, 7, 97, 98]. CVD is based on chemical reactions, typically at high temperature, and operates near thermodynamic equilibrium, which is similar to most bulk methods. In contradistinction, PVD takes place at kinetically limited conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium.\nChemical Vapor Deposition\nThe first thin-film studies on MAX phases are on Ti3SiC2 deposited by CVD, with the initial work of Nickl et al. [99] dating back to 1972. CVD growth of Ti3SiC2 was also reported by Goto and Hirai [100], Pickering et al. [101], and Racault et al. [102]. Generally, CVD requires relatively high temperatures (typically 1000–1300 ◦C) for the formation of Ti3SiC2. This is much higher than for magnetron sputtering (see next section), and the phase purity is a challenge compared to PVD. In CVD, the surface species are strongly adsorbed, leading to reduced surface diffusion, which is why higher temperatures are needed to form the complex nanolaminated structure of the MAX phases.\nAn interesting observation in CVD of Ti3SiC2 is that Ti3SiC2 may be formed not only by the simultaneous deposition of all elements but by a reaction between the gas and a solid phase such as TiC [91, 93]. This concept, termed reactive CVD (RCVD), has been used by Jacques et al. [103]] and Fakih et al. [104, 105] to synthesize Ti3SiC2/SiC multilayer coatings.\nOverall, CVD has been used to a rather limited extent for the synthesis of MAX phases, and there is room for future research, notably to synthesize MAX phases other than Ti3SiC2 by CVD. Particular promise should be held by the form of CVD known as atomic layer deposition (ALD) [106], which permits control of the deposition process on a layer-by-layer basis and would thus in principle be ideally suited for synthesis and tailoring of layered materials such as the MAX phases.\nPhysical Vapor Deposition\nPhysical vapor deposition (PVD), primarily by sputtering techniques but also cathodic arc deposition, is the most common approach to thin-film synthesis of MAX phases. Much PVD syntheses have been performed at relatively high substrate temperature (700–1000 ◦C), which is a limiting factor both for the use of temperature-sensitive substrates and for industrial applicability. Typically, M2AX phases with group-5 or group-6 M elements [6] can be vapor-deposited at relatively low substrate temperature of about 500 ◦C. This includes V2GeC [107], Cr2GeC [108, 109], and Cr2AlC [110–117], while the Ti-based MAX phases require higher temperatures. Aside from materials selection, attempted approaches to reduce the substrate temperature include ionized deposition techniques such as high-power impulse magnetron sputtering and sequential deposition of the three elements at moderate temperature (~650 ◦C for Ti3SiC2), enabling element segregation and MAX-phase formation at low temperature [118].\n2 The Mn+1AXn Phases: The Precursors for MXenes 27\nSputter deposition can be made from individual sources (targets), which are preferred for the individual control of the elements, or from compound or composite targets [103, 119, 120], which are typically preferred for reproducibility under industrial conditions (see Ref. [6] for a detailed discussion). MAX nitrides are normally grown by reactive sputtering in nitrogen gas as the source of nitrogen. Typically, the process window for growth of pure MAX-phase films is then narrow [6], and the use of reactive sputtering for MAX carbides has been quite limited. There are, however, a few studies that indicate that the technique has potential for broader use [45, 121].\nCompared to sputtering, cathodic arc deposition has had more limited use for MAX-phase synthesis, for example, for growth of Ti2AlC [122–127], using a pulsed cathodic arc setup from elemental Ti, Al, and C cathodes. A key difference with arc deposition compared to sputtering is its high degree of ionization (almost 100%) of the deposition flux, suggesting an approach for temperature reduction."

      "text" : "Solid-state reactions as a thin-film synthesis method consist of two main variations: one based on between the film and the substrate and the other based on film/film reactions. The most important example of the former is Ti3SiC2 synthesized by annealing of Ti-based contacts in SiC devices [128–138]. The second category involves deposition of a film containing the three elements M, A, and X in the right proportions, for example, in a multilayer [139–143], or in amorphous or nanocrystalline form [144–146]. Annealing at higher temperature then initiates the transformation to the MAX phase.\nAs mentioned in the section “Noble-Metal-Containing MAX Phases”, several new MAX phases and related nanolaminated carbides have been synthesized by solid-state reaction between Au or other noble-metal capping layers and the underlying nanolaminated carbide thin films, such as Ti3AuC2, Ti3Au2C2, Mo2AuC, and Mo2Au2C [53–57]."

      "text" : "The MAX phases are metallic conductors with room-temperature resistivities of the order of a few tens of μ cm (in comparison, the corresponding values for Ag and Ti are about 1.6 μ cm and 40 μ cm, respectively). In general, the electrical properties are moderately anisotropic, in that the conductivity along the c axis and along the a axis differ but are metallic and of the same order of magnitude [6, 147–152]. There is, however, recent work with measurements on single crystals showing that some MAX phases (V2AlC and Cr2AlC) have a much higher degree of anisotropy [153].\n28 M. W. Barsoum and P. Eklund\nThe Seebeck coefficient (or thermopower), S, of a material is defined as ΔV/ΔT, the voltage ΔV induced across a material exposed to a temperature gradient of ΔT. The MAX phases generally have low Seebeck coefficients. However, Ti3SiC2 is remarkable in this context: bulk samples of Ti3SiC2 exhibit negligible S over a very wide temperature range, from 300 to 850 K [154], a unique phenomenon. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Chaput et al. [155, 156] explained this phenomenon by suggesting that two types of bands contribute to the Seebeck coefficient in Ti3SiC2, a hole-like band in the ab-plane and an electron-like band along the c axis, with twice the value in the c direction as that in the a direction, but with opposite sign. Therefore, the Seebeck coefficient macroscopically sums up to zero in a randomly oriented sample. This was experimentally confirmed by Magnuson et al. [157], who demonstrated that the in-plane Seebeck coefficient is positive and substantial and evidenced the anisotropic states in the electronic structures, which are the underlying source of the near-zero Seebeck coefficient in bulk, polycrystalline Ti3SiC2.\nA few MAX phases (notably Mo2GaC, with a critical temperature, Tc, of ~3.9 K [158]) were reported to be superconductors already in the 1960s. However, little or no information about the samples is accessible, and these results are difficult to evaluate. Only a Tc is typically stated. It was not until 2015 that characterization on pure samples confirmed that Mo2GaC is likely a superconductor [159]. Other reported superconductors among the MAX phases include Nb2SC [160], Nb2AsC [161], Nb2InC [162], and Ti2InC [163].\nThe key issue here, and the source of many discrepancies, is that measurements of superconductivity are highly sensitive to impurity phases. For example, Anasori et al. [164] demonstrated the effect of a superconducting impurity phase (see section 3.4 in Ref. [164] and corresponding supplementary information), which can yield an apparent superconductivity for the sample measured, even though the phase of interest is not superconducting. For example, for Nb2SnC, there are conflicting reports [161, 165] as to whether the phase is a superconductor, likely because the samples in Ref. [161] were of higher purity, while those in Ref. [165] contained an impurity phase of (superconducting) NbC, giving a false positive result. Furthermore, it is known from measurements on highly pure bulk and thinfilm samples that Ti2GeC is not superconducting [166]. Despite this fact, there is an erroneous report [167] claiming superconductivity in that compound, where the samples in question contained a large amount of a superconducting impurity phase. Overall, these observations emphasize the need for great care in characterizing superconductivity."

One of the most important is the ease by which relatively large quantities can be made. The price of entry is nothing more sophisticated than a high-temperature furnace with controlled atmosphere and a fume hood for etching purposes. At this juncture, it is worth noting that it is possible to make pure MXene powders/films/colloidal suspensions starting with very impure materials provided the latter cannot be delaminated. This characteristic was exploited in making low-cost MXenes starting with rutile, Al and C [168]. In this process, cheap rutile is reacted with Al and C to make Ti3AlC2 or Ti2AlC and alumina. After etching and delamination of the MXene flakes, the alumina particles are centrifuged out. The resulting colloidal suspension is thus comprised of quite pure MXene.\nIn terms of intellectual property, several patents have been issued [169, 170]. There are several others in the pipeline. Industrial interest has also been quite high, and there is a good chance that a commercial product will be introduced in the market within just a couple of years. If that occurs, then the time from discovery to market will have been <10 years, which would be a great testament to the utility and importance of MXenes. Their science and extraordinary properties exhibited by these fascinating 2D materials are discussed in other chapters of this book."

      "text" : "The motivation for alloying MAX phases is both curiosity-driven and motivated by application through solid solution effects and introduction of magnetic properties. It also allows substitution of nontraditional M elements like Mn [1–4]. Some of these alloys have, in turn, realized chemically disordered MXenes, such as (Ti,Nb)2C and (V,Cr)3C2 [5]. It should be noted, however, that it may be challenging to attain an a priori defined composition for a solid solution. This is in contrast to chemically ordered systems, where the stoichiometry may be governed by the underlying symmetry of the lattice.\nIn 2014, the first chemically ordered MAX phase alloy was discovered [6]. It is a M3AX2 structure, where two M elements in a 2:1 ratio form a phase with out-ofplane chemical order through alternating layers composed of one type of M element only. In 2017, ordering between M elements of the same 2:1 ratio was discovered in a M2AX phase, though this time with an in-plane chemical arrangement [7]. This finding spurred the notation o-MAX vs i-MAX, to make a distinction between the two groups of materials. Both sets have allowed new elemental combinations and introduction of elements previously not used for MAX phases. Most importantly, through chemical etching, a new type of MXenes is created with corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane ordering of elements, as well as ordering of vacancies; see schematic in Fig. 3.1. This expands the parameter space for attainable material properties.\nJ. Rosen ( ) · M. Dahlqvist · Q. Tao · L.

Rosen et al.\nStructure and Composition of o-MAX Phases\nThe first o-MAX phase was discovered by Liu et al. upon M element alloying in Cr2TiAlC2 [6]. The phase is a M3AX2 structure, with the Ti layer sandwiched between two outer Cr carbide layers [6]. This finding was soon followed by synthesis of Mo2TiAlC2 [9–10], Mo2ScAlC2 [11], and Ti2ZrAlC2 [12], all in a M3AX2 structure, and Mo2Ti2AlC2, in a M4AX3 structure [10], exemplified in Fig. 3.2b, g. Further signs of ordering have been demonstrated in the (Cr0.5V0.5)n + 1AlCn system for n = 2 and 3, while n = 1 displayed complete disorder between Cr and V [13]. Due to the ratio of the M elements, however, the ordering observed was not complete, with partial intermixing evident from neutron diffraction analysis.\nThe displayed out-of-plane chemical order in M3AX2 and M4AX3 o-MAX (see Fig. 3.2b, g) is M element specific. For M3AX2, the first M (Mo, Ti, Cr) occupies the 4f Wyckoff site, next to the Al layer, while the second M element (Ti, Sc, Zr, V) occupies the 2a Wyckoff site. The o-MAX formation has been suggested to originate from the second M element breaking the energetically unfavorable stacking of the first M element, whose binary carbides do not crystallize in the rock salt structure (Mo and Cr), thereby avoiding occupation of the center layers. This explanation is valid for some o-MAX phases, but not for Mo2ScAlC2 and Ti2ZrAlC2 [10–12, 14]. Instead, the formation of Mo2ScAlC2 may be promoted by Mo, the M element closest to the Al layer, having larger electronegativity than Al, resulting in fewer electrons available for populating the energetically expensive antibonding Al-Al orbitals [11].\n3 In- and Out-of-Plane Ordered MAX Phases and Their MXene Derivatives 39\nSynthesis and Characterization of MXene from o-MAX Phases\nThe synthesis of o-MAX phases also spurred interest in possibilities for chemically ordered MXenes. In 2015, Anasori et al. experimentally realized the first chemically ordered double-transition-metal MXenes: Mo2TiC2Tx, Mo2Ti2C3Tx, and Cr2TiC2Tx (where T is a surface termination) (see Fig. 3.2f–h) [15]. Later, Meshkian et al. demonstrated the first Sc-containing MXene with chemically ordered doubletransition-metal Mo2ScC2Tx (see Fig. 3.2a–e) [11].\nWith the discovery of ordered double-transition-metal MXenes, new insights have been gained. Since etching is a kinetically controlled process, MXenes with larger n in Mn + 1CnTx usually require stronger etching and/or a longer etching time. At the same etching conditions, Mo2Ti2AlC3 (n = 3) requires an etching time twice as long as its n = 2 counterpart Mo2TiAlC2 [15–16]. Moreover, although Mo2TiC2Tx and Ti3C2Tx are isostructural, their different outer M layers make them display significantly different electronic properties as seen in Fig. 3.3. The former exhibits semiconductor-like transport properties, while the latter is metal-like [16– 17]. Moreover, magnetoresistance measurements of the two materials also show\n40 J. Rosen et al.\nopposite sign, suggesting fundamentally different transport mechanisms [16]. It should be noted that the MXene surface terminations likely also influence these properties; however, a crude estimate based on EDX analysis indicates that the Odominated surface composition is similar for the phases exemplified here [16].\nIn Ref. [18], the electrical and thermoelectric properties were measured for Mobased MXenes (Mo2CTx, Mo2TiCTx, and Mo2Ti2C3Tx). Mo2TiC2Tx was found to have the largest thermoelectric power factor, reaching 3.09 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at 803 K. Based on theoretical calculations, and an assumed fully O-terminated surface, this was explained by Mo2TiC2O2 having much larger portion of flat bands near the Fermi level as compared to Mo2CO2 and Mo2Ti2C3O2 [19–21].\nTheoretical Predictions on MXene from o-MAX\nIn the quest for new chemically ordered double-transition-metal MXenes, Anasori et al. investigated the relative stability of 17 M′2M′′C2 and 15 M′2M′′2C3 MXenes from hypothetical o-MAX phases with different chemical ordering in the form of fully ordered and partially ordered configurations [15]. They predict that at 0 K, 26 ordered double-transition-metal MXenes should be stable with respect to the disordered counterparts [15]. Later, Tan et al. explored the structure-stability relationship for eight MXene alloy systems by mapping the degree of ordering vs temperature using high-throughput computation [22]. For Mo-rich MXenes, (MoxM′′1-x)3C2 (where M′′ = Ti, V, Nb, Ta), the Mo atoms prefer to occupy the surface layers, with the ordering persisting to high temperatures, while a Ti-based MXene alloyed with Nb or Ta shows a preference for Ti surface atoms for a Ti-rich MXene and Ti occupation of only one surface layer for Nb- and Ta-rich MXenes [22]. It should be noted that the inherent chemistry of a MXene is dependent on its parent MAX phase, which is typically synthesized at temperature above 1500 K. At such temperatures, some degree of intermixing between alloying elements is\n3 In- and Out-of-Plane Ordered MAX Phases and Their MXene Derivatives 41\ntypically expected [10, 14, 22]. Moreover, realization of new MXenes is highly dependent on realization of new MAX phases, or identification of precursors beyond MAX phases. Evaluation of the stability of novel MXenes benefits from a discussion on not only the stability of the MXene and potential precursors but also on the effect of type of surface terminations and their surface coverage.\nThe use of MXenes from MAX as well as o-MAX phases for sustainable production of molecular hydrogen as a clean energy carrier has been demonstrated by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via electrocatalysis. Examples thereof are Mo2CTx and the o-MAX Mo2TiCx [23–24]. Selected other MXenes, Ti2CTx and (Ti0.5V0.5)2CTx, have also been theoretically predicted to be effective electrocatalysts for HER under the assumption that they are fully functionalized by either O or OH groups [25–26]. Other functionalizing species may also impact the HER. Handoko et al. performed a combined experimental and theoretical study on Mo2CTx, Ti2CTx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2Ti2C3Tx using HF and LiF-HCl as etching agents and found that the presence of F terminations in Ti-based MXenes has an unfavorable impact on their HER performance, while low F coverage of Mo-based MXenes shows improved HER activity [24].\nFor evaluation of transport properties, theoretical studies have shown that pristine MXenes are mostly metallic [15]; however, upon functionalization, some become semiconducting [16, 27]. MXenes to date can thus be divided into two categories, topologically trivial and nontrivial metal/semimetal or semiconductor, which one depends on the strength of the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). With the introduction of out-of-plane ordered double-transition-metal MXenes came the possibility of alloying with heavy 4d and 5d transition metal elements. Khazaei et al. investigated the theoretical electronic properties of M′2M′′C2O2 (M′ = Mo, W; M′′ = Ti, Zr, Hf) with and without considering SOC and found that they are topological insulators with nontrivial band gaps induced by the SOC within the degenerate states with dx2−y2 and dxy characters of M′ and M′′ [20]. They further propose that W-containing MXenes might be suitable candidates for topological applications at room temperature. In contrast, they find M′2M′′2C2O2 (M′ = Mo, W; M′ = Ti, Zr, Hf) to be topological semimetals.\nSeveral theoretical studies have investigated magnetic properties of chemically ordered double-transition-metal MXenes as function of different alloying elements and terminations. The results indicate that Cr2M′′C2T2 (M′′ = T or V; T = O, OH, or F) can be nonmagnetic (NM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), or ferromagnetic (FM) and either a semiconductor or metal depending on the choice of M′′ and T [28]. This is in contrast to the robust ferromagnetism predicted for Ti2MnC2Tx (T = O, OH, or F), Hf2MnC2O2, and Hf2VC2O2, with high magnetic moments (3–4 μB/unit cell) and high Curie temperatures (495 K–1133 K) which make them potentially interesting for spintronic applications [29]. The predicted electronic and magnetic properties can be further modified through strain. For Mn-containing MXenes, upon moderate tensile in-plane strain (0–3%), semimetal to semiconductor and ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transitions occur [29]. Yang et al. used theory to investigate Cr2M′′2C3T2 (M′′ = Ti, V, Nb, or Ta; T = OH, O, or F), upon in-plane strain (−5 to +5%), and found AFM to be favorable for M′′ = Nb and Ta at\nall strains and terminations [30]. For M′′ = Ti and V, a more complex behavior was found, with preferential FM or AFM spin configuration depending on the choice of terminations [30].\nAltogether, the properties of MXenes from o-MAX (electronic, electrochemical, magnetic, etc.) can be tuned through choice of the M elements and terminating species (T). It should be noted that the output from the theoretical studies are strongly influenced by the choice of MXene terminations, which has been shown by calculations to have a drastic effect on the properties. Examples thereof are preferred magnetic ground states as seen in Fig. 3.4 [30] and metallic or semiconducting behavior [16, 28]. Depending on the etching route used, multiple termination concentrations and configurations can exist. Moreover, different MXenes may have a preference for different terminations [31]. Here, experimental input with respect to the nature of the terminations and the concentration of terminating species are crucial for guidance of future realistic theoretical studies of MXenes.\nStructure and Composition of i-MAX Phases\nMAX phases displaying in-plane chemical ordering is a more recent addition to the MAX phase family. The discovery was made in connection to synthesis of the o-MAX phase Mo2ScAlC2 [11]. During the materials optimization process,\n3 In- and Out-of-Plane Ordered MAX Phases and Their MXene Derivatives 43\nevidence of a 211 phase was concluded from the XRD pattern. Considering that neither Mo2AlC nor Sc2AlC exist (based on theoretical predictions and lack of experimental observations), we assumed that a solid solution of (Mo,Sc)2AlC had formed. Targeting this new phase through iterative theoretical and experimental efforts, in particular with extensive high-resolution STEM analysis, we soon realized that the M elements displayed in-plane chemical order (see Fig. 3.5). Due to the large Z contrast (atomic mass) between Mo and Sc, there are two bright and one dark patterns in the transition metal carbide layer, which means that the ideal composition must be (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC [7]. Due to a strong monoclinic distortion, the crystal structure of this phase is described with a monoclinic (C2/c) structure, though the orthorhombic (Cmcm) structure is almost degenerate in energy. The crystal structure has been confirmed by Rietveld refinement of XRD as well as neutron diffraction [7].\nThe subsequent findings of a range of similar in-plane chemically ordered MAX phases coined i-MAX as a collective notation for this family of materials. To date, eight i-MAX phases can be found in the literature, (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC, (V2/3Zr1/3)2AlC, (Cr2/3Sc1/3)2AlC, (Cr2/3Y1/3)2AlC, (Cr2/3Zr1/3)2AlC, (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC, and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC, showing a path for introduction on nontraditional MAX phase elements in these materials (W, Y), which in turn suggests an increased range of attainable properties [32–36]. All synthesized i-MAX structures to date crystallize in one or more of the space group symmetries C/2c (#15), Cmcm (#63), and C/2m (#12), although several closely related structures of various symmetries have been theoretically demonstrated to be almost degenerate in energy [33]. The main characteristics of the i-MAX structure are the minority M elements (M2 = Sc, Y, and Zr) extending out from the M layer (M1 = Mo, V, Cr, W) toward the A layer, which in turn display Kagomé-like ordering. This is depicted in Fig. 3.6, where the i-MAX structure is compared to that of a traditional 211 MAX phase; individual layers of M (M1 + M2), A, X, and\n44 J. Rosen et al.\nM1 + M2 + X are shown in Fig. 3.6a–d with a structural overview of MAX (top row) and i-MAX phase (bottom row). To allow a detailed structural comparison, both MAX and i-MAX are shown with equal composition, here exemplified by (V2/3Zr1/3)2AlC. For the MAX phase, all layers display a hexagonal pattern. For the i-MAX structure, the hexagonal pattern is present only in the carbon layer (see Fig. 3.6c). The top view of the M layer (M1 + M2) also seems to form a hexagonal pattern (see Fig. 3.6a); however, the side view of the M2X layer in Fig. 3.6e shows that V (M1) and Zr (M2) do not form a single layer. Instead Zr (M2) is closer to the Al layer. This is typical for all i-MAX phases found to date, and the larger the M2 atom is, the closer it is to the A layer. The M1 layer has a honeycomb lattice with M2 located in the center of each hexagon. The major structural difference between the i-MAX and the MAX phase is found in the A layer (see Fig. 3.6b), being hexagonal for the MAX phase while closely resembling a Kagomé lattice for the i-MAX, thus reducing the A-A coordination from six to four.\nBased on the theoretical and empirical analyses performed to date, rules for iMAX formation can be formulated, to increase the fundamental understanding of the origin of their formation, as well as to allow prediction of further phases to be synthesized. The formation of i-MAX phases requires (i) a 2:1 ratio for M1:M2, (ii) a significantly different size of the two metals where M2 is larger, (iii) an electron population of ideally bonding orbitals only with a minimum population of antibonding orbitals, and (iv) a small-sized A which is beneficial. Of these criteria, the first three are believed to be most important [33, 37]. Furthermore, intermixing of M can also be expected; [32] however, more work remains to show how a deviation from the ideal 2:1 ratio influence the stability and what the implications are for transformation of i-MAX into i-MXene. It should be stressed that albeit the i-MAX phases have been found with three different crystal structures, transformation into MXenes from these polymorphs will result in identical i-MXene structures.\n3 In- and Out-of-Plane Ordered MAX Phases and Their MXene Derivatives 45\nSynthesis and Characterization of MXene from i-MAX\nAll reported i-MAX phases to date are Al-based, suggesting that a range of novel MXenes can be synthesized in line with the chemical etching routes used for traditional MAX phases. Using the first i-MAX phase, (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC, Tao et al. demonstrated chemical removal of not only the Al layer upon etching in HF or LiF/HCl but also selective etching of the minority M2 element Sc, realizing Mo1.33C MXene layers with ordered divacancies. A schematic of this reaction, from the iMAX phase to delaminated sheets of MXene, is shown in Fig. 3.7.\nTao et al. also verified the MXene structure of Mo1.33C by atomic resolution STEM on a single sheet of MXene. Figure 3.8a shows an overview HAADF-STEM image of a single flake with lateral dimensions >1 μm, with a medium magnification image and its fast Fourier transform seen in Fig. 3.8b. The experimentally observed pattern in Fig. 3.8c agrees strikingly well with the simulated structure of the parent MAX phase excluding Sc and Al atoms in Fig. 3.8d. A detailed description of the structure of i-MXene can be found in Ref. [38]. It can be noted that the close to ideal structure of i-MXene proves the close to ideal structure as well as composition of the parent (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC. From STEM analysis of the i-MAX phase, one\n46 J. Rosen et al.\ncan distinguish between the two different M sites, in which the M1 site is occupied by a heavier atom, indicating the chemical ordering of Mo and Sc. However, due to superposition, the micrographs do not exclude partial ordering, e.g., occupancy Mo = 0.8 and Sc = 0.2 on M1 site. Furthermore, XRD refinement is not sensitive enough to determine the occupancy on each site. Therefore, the atomic structure of i-MXene is a very strong indicator of the close to fully ordering of Mo on M1 and Sc on M2 site, as the Sc is completely removed upon etching.\nSelective etching of chemically ordered i-MAX phases for synthesis of vacancyordered MXene has been shown for several compositions: removing Al and Sc/Y from (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC both produces Mo1.33C MXene, while (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC correspondingly yield W1.33C MXene [32, 35, 39]. Another important feature of i-MAX phases is shown through the concept of “targeted etching,” which allows removal of the A layer only, to produce in-plane chemically ordered MXene. The general concept of chemical etching is to remove more weakly bonded elements while preserving the more strongly bonded counterparts. In a typical ternary MAX phase, e.g., Ti3AlC2, Al is weakly bonded to the MX layer and can relatively easily be removed. When the etching condition is more harsh, Ti can also be removed, leaving only porous carbon. For the i-MAX phases, tuning of the bonding characteristics of the M2 atoms and Al, combined with finely adjusted etching conditions, allows formation of either an i-MXene with vacancies or a MXene with in-place chemical order, i.e., targeted etching. This has been demonstrated for (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC, for which atomic resolution STEM analysis of the resulting MXenes reveals either sheets with ordered vacancies or sheets with a hexagonal atomic arrangement including both Mo and Y [39]. The tuning potential of i-MAX phases as precursors for MXenes is evident when comparing the bond strength of Sc-MX and Y-MX in (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlC, respectively. Sc, which is more loosely bonded to the MX layer, can be readily etched from its i-MAX phase, while the more strongly bonded Y can be preserved in the MXene upon etching.\nSurface terminations play an important role for the properties of MXenes. Typically, MXenes are terminated with -F, -O, and –OH, and this is also the case for the vacancy MXene Mo1.33C obtained from etching in HF followed by TBAOH intercalation. The chemical formula from XPS analysis is Mo1.2CO0.7(OH)0.5F1.1 · 0.4 H2Oads, with the identified primary termination being F [40]. This is in contrast to the Mo2C MXene without vacancies, with terminations being dominated by O. Lind et al. studied the effect of surface terminations on the structure and electronic properties of Mo1.33C by first-principle calculations [38]. It was found that the preferred termination sites of i-MXene, irrespective of terminating species, are located close to A but toward bridge sites defined as E (see Fig. 3.9a). E is located in between site A and B, which are the preferred sites of F and O, respectively, on Mo2C. While an O-terminated Mo1.33C MXene is shown to be unstable, a preference for F or a mixture of F and O is predicted. Mo2C, on the other hand, shows a preference for O terminations. The difference between the two MXenes is attributed to the different Mo content, where Mo contributes with electrons to both\n3 In- and Out-of-Plane Ordered MAX Phases and Their MXene Derivatives 47\nthe C and the terminating species. For O terminations only, the vacancy MXene have a shortage of electrons, while for F terminations, with one more electron compared to O, the orbitals can be filled and the structure stabilized. The calculated electronic structure showed the highest charge density for a termination configuration of 1O:2F (close to the experimental observations) (see Fig. 3.9b), which shed some light on the measured high electrical conductivity of Mo1.33C i-MXene.\nProperties of MXenes from i-MAX Phases\nMXenes have previously shown potential for various applications, including electrode material for energy storage, electromagnetic shielding, catalysis, sensors, etc. The discovery of i-MAX phases and their i-MXenes is very recent, but nonetheless the properties analyzed to date are very promising.\nThe first i-MXene, Mo1.33C, is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors [11, 41]. Figure 3.10a shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) at different scan rates, and a capacitance of up to 1153 F cm−3 (339 F g−1) can be achieved with a 3-μm-thick electrode. Several broad peaks are present in the CV, leading to large deviations from rectangular shape expected from double-layer capacitance alone. Quantification of the capacitive contribution to the total current was analyzed using the approach by Wang et al. [42] and was shown to increase from 45% at 2 mV s−1 to 79% at 500 mV s−1. Thus, pseudocapacitance is the major operative mechanism for a film of the vacancy MXene, as postulated for other MXenes [43]. In a comparison between Mo1.33C and Mo2C, the former display a 65% higher capacitance and three orders of magnitude higher conductivity. See Fig. 3.10b. This difference can be attributed to the formation of ordered vacancies,\n48 J. Rosen et al.\nthough the difference in surface terminations should also be kept in mind. At the time, the analysis showed record values in capacitance for a 2D material, raising questions of whether the vacancies enhance the capacitance by increasing the electrochemically active sites or by increasing the fraction of the electrode accessible to the electrolyte. Being the first evaluation of capacitance for a vacancy MXene, this and more fundamental questions need to be answered. It should be noted, however, that considering further optimization of the precursor i-MAX phase, the etching conditions, surface terminations, and the structure of the assembled MXene, the potential for improvement is very high. Considering the attained capacitance of up to 1500 F cm−3 for optimized Ti3C2/H2SO4 hydrogel [44], significantly increased values are expected also for Mo1.33C i-MXene.\nUtilizing the promising pseudocapacitive properties, Mo1.33C i-MXene was found to be an effective material for removing cations and anions [45]. As shown\n3 In- and Out-of-Plane Ordered MAX Phases and Their MXene Derivatives 49\nin Fig. 3.10c, a promising desalination performance of 15 mg/g with high charge efficiency up to 95% was reported for binder-free Mo1.33C i-MXene electrodes. Notably, the compatibility of MXene for desalination of high concentration saline solution opens new application areas, such as generation of drinking water from seawater. Further, Qin et al. reported solution-processed fabrication of a Mo1.33C iMXene/conducting polymer (PEDOT) composite as electrode material for flexible supercapacitors [7], with resulting excellent electrochemical properties of flexible devices based on the composite. With only a small amount of conducting polymer, a mass ratio of MXene/polymer = 10:1, 1310 F cm−3 was achieved. The enhanced capacitance compared to the i-MXene alone is likely due to increased spacing between MXene layers. It is also suggested that the coupling between the negatively charged MXene and positively charged PEDOT may contribute to the enhanced performance, similar to the mechanism proposed for PEDOT:PSS [46].\nThe most recently reported W1.33C i-MXene is another promising catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction [47]. The catalytic activity is compared to Mo1.33C iMXene and a Pt/carbon electrode in Fig. 3.10d. The overpotential follows the order W1.33C (unannealed) < Mo1.33C < W1.33C (annealed), with the overpotential of the annealed W1.33C being ≈320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This trend is likely related to the structure and compositional-dependent H2 adsorption free energy on the MXenes, as well as the average valance state of the surface. Thus, the optimizing potential is large, e.g., tuning the structure and composition of the MXene by changing the etching conditions and tuning the surface valence states by modifying the surface terminations. Testing the i-MXenes as catalyst for other reactions remains to be explored.\nIn summary, despite their recent discovery, both o-MAX and i-MAX phases and their MXenes have expanded the range of metals that can be incorporated in MAX phases and also added new MAX phase members. Their MXenes show a high promise for a range of applications, including energy storage, water purification, and as catalysts. As the number of novel phases increases steadily, these ordered materials will likely soon make a sizeable part of the known MAX phases and MXenes and also have an impact on the general 2D materials development. It is notable how readily corresponding MXenes can be derived.\nThere are opportunities as well as remaining questions. For example, what is the role of the ordered vacancies on the materials properties? To what extent can we control the formation of vacancies and their concentration and for which materials? Which elemental i-MAX compositions allow targeted etching, i.e., formation of chemically ordered MXenes? Future work also remains to explore these phases with respect to realization of magnetic materials, more catalysts, etc. Moreover, the finding of both o-MAX and i-MAX phases is of utmost importance for the property tuning potential of the MAX phases and their MXenes, through elemental combinations allowing new combinations of properties. Considering the high theoretical stability of these ordered materials, we suggest a potential combination thereof, i.e., phases including out-of-plane as well as in-plane chemical ordering. We coin these hypothetical phases oi-MAX while waiting for their future experimental realization.\n50 J. Rosen et al."

      "text" : "As a new family of two-dimensional materials, MXenes have attracted intensive attention since their discovery in 2011 [1]. Based on their abundant chemical elements and various functional groups, MXenes have been demonstrated to show widespread potential applications, such as in energy storage [2, 3], electromagnetic interference shielding [4], catalyst, sensors [5–12], etc. To date, more than 50 MXenes have been predicted to be stable [12], and more than 20 members have been synthesized from selective extraction approach [1, 13, 14]. The success of selective extraction is ascribed to the difference in reactivity and stability between the alternative sublayers of Mn+1AXn phases [15] (Mn+1AXn is also denoted as MAX, where M is an early transitional metal, A is an A group element, such as Al and Si. X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and n is generally from 1 to 3). Because of the high chemical activity of aluminum, most MXenes were synthesized from the Al-containing MAX phases [1, 13, 14]. Therefore, special interest was devoted to synthesize the Al-containing bulk precursors.\nHowever, a variety of transition metals, such as Sc, Zr, and Hf, are inclined to form a new type of layered compounds (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 instead of the Alcontaining Mn+1AlCn phases (where n value is similar in MAX; m usually equal to\nXian-Hu Zha and Jie Zhou contributed equally.\nX.-H.

These layered compounds consist of alternative NaCl-type M-C and Al4C3-like Al(A)-C sublayers. Based on the lattice mismatch between the cubic MC and Al4C3 unit cells [19], the relationship between the formed layered carbide and the variety of transitional metals was proposed: the (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 compound is preferred with a small lattice mismatch; otherwise, the Mn+1AlCn phase is formed. To give a more explicit picture, the structures for Mn+1AlCn, (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 (n = 3; m = 3,4) unit cells are plotted and provided in Fig. 4.1. As discussed previously [20, 21], the Mn+1AlCn phase consists of the strong bonded Mn+1Xn sublayer intercalated with the weak metallic bonded Al atomic layer. For the (MC)nAl3C2 and (MC)n[Al(A)]4C3 compounds, respectively, in Fig. 4.1b, c, they can be recognized as using Al3C3 or [Al(A)]4C4 to replace the Al atomic layer in the corresponding Mn+1AlCn phase. A carbon atomic layer is shared by the M-C and Al(A)-C sublayers at their coupling boundaries. Compared to (MC)nAl3C2, (MC)n[Al(A)]4C3 unit cell generally possesses a lower space group number and a larger lattice parameter in the c-axis. According to our previous work [22, 23], this type of layered compounds (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 could also be utilized as precursors for MXenes. Two MXenes Zr3C2Tx and Hf3C2Tx [22, 23] and a new 2D ScCxOH structure were developed based on selective etching of these non-MAX compounds. The details are reviewed in the following sections. Additionally, the existing (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 compounds are also reviewed in this chapter.\nMoreover, a non-Al-containing layered carbide Mo2Ga2C was also adopted as precursor for MXene proposed by Meshkian et al. [24] and Halim et al. [25] Compared to the MAX counterpart Mo2GaC, two Ga layers are stacked one on top of the other in Mo2Ga2C [26, 27]. The extra Ga layer causes a significant decrease of elastic modulus; that is why Mo2Ga2C could be etched different from its MAX counterpart [28]. The details are also discussed in this chapter.\n4 Non-MAX Phase Precursors for MXenes 55\nSynthesis of Zr3C2Tx MXene from Selective Etching Zr3Al3C5\nAs the first synthesized MXene, titanium carbide has been demonstrated to show promising properties and widespread applications [1–4]. For zirconium and hafnium, in the same group as titanium in the periodic table of elements, their based MXenes may also have excellent performance. According to our theoretical work, the oxygen-functionalized Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 are semiconductors with moderate bandgaps, and their thermal conductivities are higher than that of Ti2CO2 [8, 10]. In addition, zirconium- and hafnium-based compounds are generally hightemperature refractory materials [29]. Therefore, we are committed to synthesize these two transitional metal-containing MXenes. In contrast to titanium, zirconium and hafnium tend to form the layered compounds (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1, such as Zr3Al3C5 and Hf3Al4C6 [18]. As a consequence, the bulk Zr3Al3C5 was firstly adopted as a potential precursor for 2D zirconium carbide; its atomic structure is like in Fig. 4.1b. The common hydrofluoric (HF) acid was adopted as etchant.\nThe Zr3Al3C5 powder was prepared via pulsed electric current sintering (PECS) of Zr/Al/graphite powder mixtures. After sintering, the as-fabricated powders were predominantly single-phase Zr3Al3C5 besides a minor amount of ZrC impurities. Immerging these powders in 50 wt% HF at room temperature for 72 hours, more than 70 at% Zr3Al3C5 was found to transform into 2D structure. The corresponding scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the etching products are shown in Fig. 4.2a, b; accordion-like structures are observed like most reported MXenes [1, 13]. After ultrasonication, the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of few-layered structures are provided in Fig. 4.2c–e. The 2D configuration shows the\n56 X.-H. Zha et al.\nsame symmetry and similar lattice parameter to its bulk precursor in the horizontal plane; thus the 2D configuration could be sublayer of bulk precursor as reported for MXenes [1]. Based on the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the 2D structure shows the presence of Zr, C, O, and F, but the signal of Al in precursor is generally removed. Therefore, the Al-C units in Zr3Al3C5 were etched out, and the 2D structure was determined as zirconium carbide. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results in the Al 2p region, and C 1s region shows significant decrease in the content of Al-C bonding (from 11.39% to 1.87%) after HF treatment, which suggests that the selective etching of Al-C layer from the primitive unit cell has occurred. Concomitantly, fitted XPS results in Zr 3d region and O 1s region imply the possible formation of zirconium carbide with mixed F, O, and OH surface termination.\nSince it’s difficult to determine the carbon ratio from XPS and EDS, the affiliation of the shared carbon atomic layer post etching is not clear. Thus, the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) [30] was also adopted to investigate the atomic structure and physical properties of the etching product. Based on the Zr3Al3C5 unit cell presented in Fig. 4.2f, two models were proposed shown in Fig. 4.2g, h, respectively, denoting the shared carbon atomic layer was etched with Al-C units and retained on the etching product zirconium carbide. After structure relaxation, Model A shows a much lower energy, implying the as-synthesized 2D zirconium carbide is Zr3C2Tx MXene. The Al3C3 unit in Zr3Al3C5 was etched out, and it was then replaced by O, OH, and F surface groups in the aqueous HF solution. Based on DFT optimization, all functional groups (T = O, F, OH) are stabilized on the top sites of the middle zirconium atoms on both sides. The top view and side view of Zr3C2T2 are shown in Fig. 4.2i, j, respectively. The F- and OH-terminated configurations are metallic, and Zr3C2O2 shows semimetal property. Moreover, the oxygen-terminated configuration was predicted to show high mechanical strength, in which c11 value was calculated to be 393 GPa.\nSince zirconium-based compounds are generally high-temperature refractory material [29], the thermodynamic property of synthesized Zr3C2Tx was further investigated, and the well-studied Ti3C2Tx MXene was also studied for comparison. According to Fig. 4.3, Ti3C2Tx MXene was determined to partially transform into cubic TiC above 800 ◦C, while the Zr3C2Tx MXene was found to be thermodynamically stable that even approached 1200 ◦C, the highest temperature investigated. The different stabilities were further explained with the aid of DFT calculation. The cubic TiC shows higher cohesive energy than the Ti3C2 MXene (8.741 vs 8.080 eV/atom); thus the latter is transformed into the stable cubic phase at a high temperature. In contrast, Zr3C2 MXene possesses a higher cohesive energy than its competitive cubic phase (8.483 vs 8.468 eV/atom), and it can exist stably even under the elevated temperature.\nIn this section, we have reviewed Ref. [22] for the synthesis of the 2D Zr3C2Tx MXene from etching of non-MAX phase Zr3Al3C5. Using this new type of layered compounds as precursors generally provides a new approach for fabricating MXenes. In addition, the as-synthesized Zr3C2Tx shows high thermal stability, which enables its potential applications range from electrode materials in electrical\n4 Non-MAX Phase Precursors for MXenes 57\nenergy storage to sensors and catalysts, especially when served in a relatively hightemperature environment.\nSynthesis of Hf3C2Tx MXene from Selective Etching Solid Solution Hf3(Al,Si)4C6\nAfter synthesis of Zr3C2Tx MXene, we further tended to synthesize the Hf3C2Tx MXene based on the selective etching of the non-MAX precursor. The bulk Hf3Al4C6 was adopted as the precursor which has a similar structure to Fig. 4.1c. However, the main etching product of Hf3Al4C6 in the HF solutions even with different concentrations was cubic HfC phase with submicron particle size. This behavior could be ascribed to the much stronger Hf-C bonds at the etching interface in Hf3Al4C6 compared to those Zr-C bonds in Zr3Al3C5. As a consequence, activating the Al-C sublayer and weakening the interfacial adhesion between HfC and Al-C units would be beneficial to realize the selective etching process. Previously, Zhang et al. found that the solid solution of Si-Al in the silicon layer of Ti3SiC2 weakened the bonds and facilitated the exfoliation of Ti3(Si0.75Al0.25)C2 [31]. Inspired by this work, we developed a solid solution method to manipulate the interface bonding. A small amount of silicon was alloyed into the ternary HfAl-C carbide with Si on Al sites, forming a Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 compound. Immersing the solid solution in the concentrated HF solution, a 2D hafnium-containing MXene Hf3C2Tx was produced by selective etching of [Al(Si)]4C4 sublayer from the parent Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 compound.\nTo figure out why the introduction of silicon can facilitate the etching process, the adhesive energy between two detached layers implying the strength of the layer adhesion was investigated theoretically. The results implied that the adhesive\n58 X.-H. Zha et al.\nenergy reduced significantly through silicon substitution of aluminum. To deeply understand this behavior, the atomic charges and bond lengths at the etching interfaces were studied, since the solid solution was determined to be ionic and the strength of an ionic bond was found proportional to the atomic charge and opposite to the bond length [32]. The weakening of the Hf-C bonds at the etching interface could be ascribed to the larger atomic charge of silicon (2.36) than that of aluminum (2.19). The shared carbon layer is bonded stronger with the aluminum layer after introducing silicon, and thus the adhesion of the neighboring etching interface is weakened.\nThe Hf3Al4C6 and Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 powders were also synthesized by the PECS process. For the solid solution, the as-synthesized powders are mainly composed of Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 besides a small amount of Hf2[Al(Si)]4C5 and rock salt-like cubic HfC secondary phase. After treatment with concentrated HF solution (35 wt%) at room temperature for about 60 hours, the precursor was partially converted to MXene. Meanwhile, the Hf2[Al(Si)]4C5 secondary phase converted into MXenes after the HF treatment as well. The as-synthesized Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 phase exhibits a typical lamellar morphology (Fig. 4.4a). In contrast, delaminated few-layered thin flakes with large lateral size (2–5 μm) (Fig. 4.4b) are observed in the HFetched material after mild sonication and centrifugation. The corresponding EDS analysis of the flakes shows the presence of Hf, C, O, and F, but disappearance of the Al and Si signals. The obtained Hf/Al atomic ratio (3.0:1.3) from EDS analysis (from an area of about 2000 μm2) was used to quantify the fraction of unreacted precursor, and it was estimated that more than 65 at% of the Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 has been transformed. Moreover, XPS results in the Al 2p region, Si 2p region, and C 1s region show significant decrease in the content of Al(Si)-C bonding (from 20.29% to 11.74%) after HF treatment, which suggests that the selective etching of Al(Si)-C layer from the primitive unit cell has occurred. Concomitantly, fitted XPS results in Hf 4f region and O1s region indicate the possible formation of Hf3C2 with mixed F, O, and OH surface termination. After sonication and centrifugation of the HF-treated powders, thin flakes with scrolled behavior can be observed (Fig. 4.4c), and corresponding EDS results confirm the presence of Hf, C, and O signals (Fig. 4.4f). The hexagonal symmetry in the basal plane was reserved (Fig. 4.4d), and the thickness of a monolayer sheet was estimated to be about 1.2 nm (Fig. 4.4e). It is interesting to note that the multilayered Hf3C2Tx materials are able to delaminate and form a stable colloidal solution in deionized water without pre-treatment with an additional intercalate agent. This behavior could be ascribed to the relatively lower adhesive energy in multilayer Hf3C2F2 compared to that of typical Ti3C2F2 MXene. From theoretical calculation, the adhesive energy in multilayer Hf3C2F2 is approximate to that in graphite [33], which is only one-quarter of that in multilayer Ti3C2F2.\nThe intrinsic physical properties of the as-synthesized Hf3C2Tx MXenes were further studied. From theoretical prediction, the functional groups T (T = O, F, OH) are all stabilized on the top sites of the middle hafnium atoms like in the Zr3C2T2 MXene. Similar to most MXenes [8], oxygen-terminated Hf3C2O2 presents smaller structural parameters and larger elastic constants compared to\n4 Non-MAX Phase Precursors for MXenes 59\n60 X.-H. Zha et al.\nHf3C2F2 and Hf3C2(OH)2. Its c11 value is predicted to be 417 GPa. Similar to Zr3C2T2 [22], both fluorine- and hydroxyl-terminated configurations are metallic, and the oxygen-functionalized one is a semimetal. Based on the Boltzmann transport theory [34], the predicted electrical conductivities σ xx/τ of the Hf3C2T2 MXenes were found in the order of 1020 −1 m−1 s−1. Due to the semimetal properties of Hf3C2O2, the electrical conductivity under various strains was investigated theoretically. Both biaxial and uniaxial strains are efficient in manipulating the magnitude of the Hf3C2O2 electrical conductivity. Moreover, the uniaxial strain could control the anisotropy of electrical conductivity [35]. As a consequence, Hf3C2O2 could be utilized in mechanical sensors.\nThe feasibility of using delaminated Hf3C2Tx (d-Hf3C2Tx) MXene flake-based materials as anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) was further explored experimentally. Electrochemical measurements implied that the charge storage in d-Hf3C2Tx was due to the intercalation of Li+ and Na+ ions rather than a conversion reaction. It exhibited reversible volumetric capacities of 1567 mAh cm−3 and 504 mAh cm−3, respectively, for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries at a current density of 200 mA g−1 after 200 cycles (Fig. 4.5a). The performance of d-Hf3C2Tx MXene-based anode in LIBs is comparable to what was reported for Sn4+ ion decorated Ti3C2 nanocomposites (PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2, 1375 mAh cm−3 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1) [54]. Moreover, benefiting from the improved structural/chemical stability of its interleaved architecture, the dHf3C2Tx material showed good rate performance in SIBs; the electrode had a stable charge/discharge cycle with no obvious capacity loss (312 mAh cm−3@1A g−1, 10 cycles) even at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4.5b). These results suggest that d-Hf3C2Tx with 2D structure is a candidate anode material for metal-ion intercalation, especially for applications where size matters.\nIn this section, the synthesis of 2D Hf3C2Tx MXene and corresponding physical properties were reviewed, which details are presented in Ref. [23]. Based on the\n4 Non-MAX Phase Precursors for MXenes 61\nspecial configuration of bulk precursor with a carbon atomic layer shared by the MC and Al-C units, a solid solution approach was adopted to manipulate the interface adhesion to facilitate the selective etching process. Based on this technique, it is anticipated that many new 2D structures will be realized. Regarding the synthesized Hf3C2Tx MXene, it shows relatively high volumetric capacities in lithium- and sodium-ion batteries. In addition, the Hf3C2Tx MXene has abundant electrons that may be important for catalysis and electromagnetic interference shielding applications beyond energy storage.\nSynthesis of ScCxOH from Selective Etching ScAl3C3\nAdditionally, 2D scandium carbide Sc2CT2 (T = O, F, OH) was predicted as the only MXene member showing semiconducting regardless of functional group [8, 36]. Special interest was devoted to synthesize the 2D scandium carbide. Since scandium is inclined to form ScAl3C3 rather than Al-containing MAX phase [17], the ternary ScAl3C3 compound was adopted as the precursor. However, it was found that ScAl3C3 was easily dissolved in HF acid and formed in ScFx because the scandium and fluorine showed strong affinity. Thus, an alternative aqueous organic base tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) was adopted as etchant. Based on this procedure, we successfully obtained a new hydroxyl-terminated scandium carbide ScCxOH. We summarize the results here. For more details, please refer to Ref. [37].\nThe ScAl3C3 precursor was also synthesized by the PECS process. Its crystallites show typical plate-like morphology for layered materials. After treatment with aqueous TMAOH solution, most ScAl3C3 was converted to corresponding 2D structure. Sonication and centrifugation of the etched powders resulted in the separation of the flakes. Thin folded flexible flakes are obtained, in contrast to the relatively flat morphology with large in-plane stiffness typical of previously reported MXenes [1]. The measured value of the in-plane lattice parameter is approximately that of the original ScAl3C3 crystal, showing that the hexagonal crystal structure of the ScAl3C3 basal planes was inherited by the 2D sheets. According to the XPS measurement, the etched sample could be ScCx with a mixture of OH, Al(OH)4− surface groups and intercalated TMA+ ions. Monochromated STEMEELS was employed to evaluate the optical properties, and the valence EELS (VEELS) properties of the ScC sheet were acquired. The particle was determined to exhibit a direct bandgap of about 2.55 eV. Furthermore, as-synthesized few-layer ScC photodetecting device exhibits excellent photoresponse properties in the visible light region. Its responsivity and quantum efficiency are comparative with that of traditional pure GaN detector (0.148 A W−1, 51%) [38].\nIn this section, the synthesis of a 2D scandium carbide and corresponding physical properties is discussed. The 2D configuration is synthesized by selective etching of Al3C2 sublayers from the parent ScAl3C3 compound in aqueous organic base solution. This configuration is a semiconductor with an experimentally measured\n62 X.-H. Zha et al.\ndirect bandgap of ~2.5 eV. In addition, a photodetecting device made from ScCxOH few layers exhibits excellent photoresponse properties in the visible-light region. This as-synthesized semiconductor has possible applications of 2D transitional metal carbides in optoelectronic and within photocatalytic chemistry."

To facilitate the synthesis of more 2D layered carbides, the existing potential precursors (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 are reviewed in this section. Experimental investigations have identified more than 30 (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 members. Specifically, ThAl4C4 [39], Zr2Al3C4, Zr3Al3C5, Hf2Al3C4, Hf3Al3C5 [18], ScAl3C3 [40], U2Al3C4 [41], UAl3C3, and YbAl3C3 [42] have been reported many years ago, while LuAl3C3 [43], YAl3C3 [44], CeAl3C3, DyAl3C3, ErAl3C3, TmAl3C3 [45], ZrAl4C4 [46], ZrAl8C7 [47], Zr2Al4C5, Zr3Al4C6 [48], Zr2[Al(Si)]4C5 [49], Zr3[Al(Si)]4C6 [50], [(ZrY)]2Al4C5 [51], Zr2[Al(Ge)]4C5, Zr3[Al(Ge)]4C6 [52], Zr[Al(Si)]8C7, Zr[Al(Si)]4C4 [53], Hf2Al4C5, Hf3Al4C6 [54], and HfAl4C4 [55] were developed after 2006. All these existing members and their space groups are listed in Table 4.1. The crystal structure of these carbides can be described as an intergrowth structure of layers with NaCl-type M-C and Al4C3-like Al3C2/[Al(A)]4C3 sharing a carbon monolayer at their coupling boundaries [16]. The electronic characteristics and intrinsic properties of the M-C and Al-C slabs in (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 crystal were comparable with those of the corresponding binary carbides MC and Al4C3, respectively. Generally, the MC layers are chemically stable, which is similar to those of the Mn+1Xn layers in MAX phases [16, 56, 57]. The Al4C3 is prone to hydrolysis in humid air or acidic media. Therefore, compared with M-C slabs, the Al-C units have relatively weaker bonding and higher chemical reactivity. In the past decade, many progress were toward developing synthesis methods for the layered (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 compounds [16]. Several approaches were developed, including arc melting [18], solid state reaction [49], pulsed electric current sintering (PECS) [58], and reactive hot pressing [59].\nSynthesis of Mo2CTx MXene from Selective Etching of Mo2Ga2C\nAs predicted by Khazaei et al., Mo2CTx may be a promising thermoelectric material [56]. Therefore, many efforts were devoted to synthesize this material. Although Mo2GaC had been synthesized as early as 1967 [60], challenges still exist by selective etching of this compound. In 2015, Hu et al. synthesized a new type of\n4 Non-MAX Phase Precursors for MXenes 63\nlayered carbide Mo2Ga2C wherein two Ga layers instead of one are stacked between Mo2C layers [61]. The atomic structure of Mo2Ga2C and its stability had been well studied [26–28, 61]. In Hu’s work, they synthesized two forms for this compound: thin film and bulk. The thin film was grown by direct current magnetron sputtering of elemental targets on MgO(111) substrates, and the bulk state was synthesized by heating the mixture of Mo2C and Ga. The details can be referred to Ref. [62]. It was demonstrated that the Mo2Ga2C compound also belongs to the hexagonal lattice (space group is P63/mmc), with a and c lattice parameters of 3.05 and 18.19 Å, respectively. The EDX maps of the synthesized Mo2Ga2C compound are shown in Fig. 4.6a–f, wherein two Ga layers are located exactly on top of each other.\nIn the same year, Meshkian et al. adopted the Mo2Ga2C thin film as the precursor for the synthesis of Mo2C MXene [24]. By immerging the film in 50 wt% concentrated hydrofluoric acid solution for 3 hours at a temperature of 50 ◦C, the Ga layer was evidently etched out, and the Mo2CTx MXene was obtained eventually (Fig. 4.6). The retained Ga layer is caused by the difficulty of etching Ga from Mo2GaC that coexists with Mo2Ga2C. This is the first work on synthesis of MXene from the non-Al-containing layered carbides. Moreover, this is also the first report on the synthesis of Mo-containing MXene.\nLater, Halim et al. also synthesized the Mo2CTx MXene through selective etching of Mo2Ga2C. Differently, they chose the bulk Mo2Ga2C as precursor and tested two different etchants, LiF + HCl and HF acid [25]. Based on the LiF + HCl solution, they produced less defective flakes. By testing the electrical transport property, they found that the Mo2CTx shows semiconductor-like behavior [25], in contrast to Ti3C2Tx which shows metallic [62]. Moreover, the Mo2CTx shows promising applications in supercapacitors and batteries. For electrodes in supercapacitors, a capacity as high as 700 F cm−3 is obtained in a 1 M sulfuric acid electrolyte and high capacity retention for at least 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. When acting as electrode materials for Li-ion battery, the free-standing films intercalated with ~8 wt% carbon nanotubes show stable reversible capacities of 250 and 76 mAh g−1, respectively, at 20 and 131 C cycling rates.\n64 X.-H. Zha et al.\nIn this section, the synthesis of Mo2CTx from selective etching of non-Alcontaining layered carbide Mo2Ga2C was reviewed. The synthesized Mo2CTx shows semiconductor-like behavior and promising applications in supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. This work generally opens a door to synthesize MXenes from selective etching of the Ga-containing layered carbides.\n4 Non-MAX Phase Precursors for MXenes 65"

Based on this approach, two fascinating MXenes Zr3C2Tx and Hf3C2Tx were synthesized and found to show potential applications such as electrode materials, sensors, catalysts, and refractory coatings. Moreover, a new 2D hydroxyl-terminated scandium carbide was also developed. Based on the large family of (MC)n[Al(A)]mCm−1 compounds, our developed approach will further enrich MXene members. Moreover, the Mo2CTx had been successfully synthesized from the non-Al-containing layered carbide Mo2Ga2C. The non-MAX phase with double instead of single A-atomic layer as in MAX phases could also be candidate precursors for MXenes.

      "text" : "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, commonly known as MXenes, have continually gained interest since the discovery of the first MXene in 2011, due to their tunable structures, wide variety of properties, and performance in an extensive set of applications. The material family is composed of approximately 20 experimentally produced MXenes, and many more are theoretically predicted.\nMXenes have a general formula of Mn+1Xn, where M is an early transition metal (Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Cr, Hf, Zn, Sc, etc.), X represents carbon (C) and/or nitrogen (N), and n is from 1 to 3, representing the three common structures (M2X, M3X2, and M4X3). Recently, the family has grown to include more structures by design, including ordered and solid solutions of double-M MXenes (M′2M′′C2 and M′2M′′2C3) and ordered vacancies, such as Mo1.33C. After synthesis, MXenes reported so far have surface terminations, such as hydroxyl (OH), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F), rendering their surfaces hydrophilic and additionally making them easier to solution-process in aqueous or organic systems, deposit as thin or freestanding films, or collect as highly concentrated slurries or powders.\nSince the first successful selective extraction of Al from Ti3AlC2 to produce Ti3C2, top-down synthesis methods have been the primary route used to produce MXenes. Here, a top-down method refers to the process where a bulk material or powder is reduced, made smaller, or part of the bulk structure is removed, leaving micro- to nano-sized particles. A few examples of top-down routes consist of lithography, polishing, and wet chemical etching. This chapter will overview\nK. Maleski ( ) · M. Alhabeb ( ) A.J.

Alhabeb\ncurrent top-down wet chemical etching methods used to synthesize MXenes, general processing and properties which should be expected after each synthesis route, an overview of current challenges, and a perspective for the future.\nGeneral Synthesis Approach for Top-Down Selective Etching of Al\nMethods of producing (2D) materials vary across literature, but almost all require exfoliation from bulk layered materials which have strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane bonding [1, 2]. A common example of this is exfoliation of graphite, where graphite must be sheared mechanically or expanded chemically to break the weak out-of-plane bonding and produce an atomically thin sheet of material, known as graphene [3]. The production of 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, hexagonal boron nitride, etc., has been achieved mechanically by scotch tape, ball milling, shearing, etc. and chemically by ion intercalation or sonication/dispersion in solvent, polymer, or surfactant-assisted solutions [4]. Mechanical exfoliation, such as exfoliation of graphite into 2D graphene, has been applied on MAX phase layered precursors to try to synthesize MXenes but failed to break the metallic M–A bonds [4, 5]. Therefore, most of the synthesis procedures described to date use top-down or wet chemical etching to produce MXenes.\nTop-down synthesis of MXene begins by etching the parent layered precursor (discussed in Chaps. 2, 3, and 4), which can be a MAX phase or non-MAX phase precursor (Fig. 5.1). The first MXene, titanium carbide (Ti3C2), was produced\n5 Top-Down MXene Synthesis (Selective Etching) 71\nthrough selective etching of Al from Ti3AlC2 (MAX) using hydrofluoric acid (HF) [6]. Since then, top-down synthesis routes using HF, or forming HF in situ using fluoride solutions, have been critical to producing many MXenes from the layered precursors [7]. Currently, most top-down synthesis methods for MXene still rely on fluoride-based etchants because of the selectivity to etch the A element; however, there have been reports of alternative synthesis methods using molten salts, alkaline solutions, and/or hydrothermal treatments, broadening the synthesis routes as well as resulting properties.\nRegardless of the etchant, the surface of the material is not pristine and is often decorated with various concentrations of surface functionalities (Fig. 5.1, e.g., material shown with -OH termination). Fluorine (F), hydroxyl (OH), and oxygen (O) are the typical surface groups observed on any given MXene surface, and the concentration of each one has been shown to be dependent on the synthesis method [6, 8, 9]. Additionally, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements showed that instead of regions or areas that are monodisperse in termination, random distributions of surface terminations are more realistic [8]. The surfaces that are created as a result of selectively etching A elements have been theoretically predicted to determine many material properties, such as electronic band structure, optical absorption, and chemical reactivity [10–13].\nTo date, around 22 different MXenes have been synthesized and dozens have been predicted [11], making it one of the most rapidly evolving 2D material families [7, 11, 14, 15]. Table 5.1 summarizes the current synthesis methods for creating MXenes from Al-containing layered precursors, which can be categorized into five categories: (i) HF, (ii) HF-forming, (iii) HF-containing (mixed acid) etchants, (iv) molten-salt etching techniques, and (v) alkaline and/or hydrothermal treatments."

      "text" : "Exposing a layered precursor (e.g., Ti3AlC2) to concentrated solutions of aqueous HF (50 wt%) was the first approach shown to weaken the M–A metallic bonds as well as retain the strength of the M–X bonds, leading to etching of the A layer (mostly Al) from different Mn+1AXn systems (M = Ti, Nb, Ta, V) [6]. Top-down selective etching utilizing fluorine-containing etchants has been proposed to involve the following reaction where the reaction of Ti3AlC2 with HF is used as an example:\nTi3AlC2 + 3HF = AlF3 + ( 3\n2\n) H2 + Ti3C2 (5.1)\nDuring this reaction, the aluminum layers are removed in between individual Ti3C2 layers, resulting in the loss of metallic bonding between Ti and Al [47]. The exposure time in HF has varied in literature from a few hours to days and the etching temperature from room temperature (~ 22 ◦C) to higher temperatures,\n72 K. Maleski and M. Alhabeb\n5 Top-Down MXene Synthesis (Selective Etching) 73\nsuch as ~ 50 ◦C [7]. For example, extraction of Al from Ti3AlC2 using HF showed that as low as 2 hours of exposure time was sufficient, as shown in Figure 5.2 [27]. Changing the concentration of HF from low (~3 wt% HF to 7 wt% HF) has also shown changes in the defect concentration of the materials produced, with higher numbers of defects present with increasing HF content in the etchant solution (also discussed in Chap. 7) [32]. In addition to the etching time, etchant concentration, and temperature, there are many layered precursors, each with different structures and compositions; therefore, the synthesis route to selectively etch Al may differ. In general, thinner Mn+1AXn lamellas (n = 1) require less exposure time to HF than the thicker counterparts (n = 2 or 3).\nIn addition to MXenes listed in Table 5.1, new MXene members (Hf3C2 and Mo1.33C) have been recently synthesized from Hf3(AlSi)4C6 and (Mo0.67Sc0.33)2AlC using HF [22, 43]. MXenes synthesized from selectively etching with HF acid, regardless of concentration, exhibit surfaces terminated with -F and -OH more than -O groups [24]."

      "text" : "Due to HF being extremely dangerous and harmful to the environment, alternatives were found to lessen the quantity of HF and make the reaction safer. HF can be formed via hydrolysis of bifluoride salts or via the reaction of a fluoride salt with\n74 K. Maleski and M. Alhabeb\nacid, and both routes have been used to prepare in situ HF etchants for selective etching of MAX phase precursors. Sodium bifluoride, potassium bifluoride, and ammonium bifluoride were used in the synthesis of Ti3C2 through selective etching of Al from Ti3AlC2 [37, 48]. Also, reacting fluoride salts such as lithium fluoride (LiF) with an acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), have been used to synthesize Ti3C2 and Mo2C [30, 49].\nWhen reacting LiF with HCl, the fluoride salt must act as the limiting reagent [14]. In comparison to using only HF as the etchant, MXene synthesized with HF-forming etchants exhibit larger interlayer spacing attributed to intercalation of cations of fluoride or bifluoride salts used to prepare the etchants. Although this route is preferred due to less time required to achieve delamination, MXene synthesized with this route often contains unetched MAX, and the yield is a major issue when it comes to scalability. In LiF/HCl etching routes, the amount or concentration of HF and LiCl produced as well as the excess HCl remaining is dependent on the molarity of both reactants. Therefore, the scalability of these methods is an issue considering the yield of exfoliated MXene will also contain a portion of unetched MAX [14, 30].\nIn 2014, Ghidiu et al. showed that in situ HF etchants using LiF/HCl resulted in processable Ti3C2 MXene due to the presence of an intercalant (Li+) in the etchant solution [30]. The presence of intercalants in both methods, HF etching and DMSO intercalation as well as LiF/HCl etching, facilitated exfoliation of Ti3C2 into single flakes after sonication [28, 30]. Due to sonication, the lateral size of the resultant flakes was on the nanoscale, ranging in size of a few hundred nanometers [28, 30]. Because the lateral size of exfoliated material is dependent on the starting grain size\n5 Top-Down MXene Synthesis (Selective Etching) 75\nof the parent MAX (usually 10–15 μm), producing, separating, and transferring a single flake with nanometer-size lateral dimensions makes studying properties of a single flake of MXene a challenge.\nOne approach to tackle this challenge was through optimization of the etching methods to make the flakes larger in lateral size (Fig. 5.3). This was accomplished through changing the concentration of exchanged cations since the intercalation process in the LiF/HCl method depends on the concentration of H+ exchanged with Li+ [14, 31]. Thus, instead of using 5 M LiF in 6 M HCl per mole of Ti3AlC2,\n76 K. Maleski and M. Alhabeb\nthe improved method utilized 12 M LiF in 9 M HCl. The materials produced had an increase in lateral size (4–5 μm), and the delamination was achieved without sonication (Fig. 5.3) [14]. Optimizing the approach where sonication is optional was named minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) [14, 31]. Another advantage of MILD method is the higher yield of exfoliated MXene (10–15%) rather than around 5% in the “clay” LiF/HCl method [30], as well as enabling the study of single-flake Ti3C2 properties [31, 32]."

Intercalation of TBAOH into Mo2TiC2 and Mo2Ti2C3 MXenes, followed by manual shaking and washing of the intercalants, resulted in stable colloidal solutions of MXene [42]. Using the HF/HCl synthesis route has proven to be more controllable in terms of the etchant ingredients and quantity of HF used, making it advantageous compared to etching with HF alone."

This was hypothesized to be because the calculated cohesion energies are lower for nitride MXenes than carbides and the formation energies of nitride MXenes from nitride-based MAX phase is higher than that of carbide MXene from carbide-based MAX phase [46]. In contrast to the methods mentioned above, nitride MXenes, specifically Ti4N3, have been produced through selective etching of Al from Ti4AlN3 by using molten salts, such as potassium fluoride (KF), lithium fluoride (LiF), and sodium fluoride (NaF) [46]. To etch, the molten salt and Ti4AlC3 mixture was heated to 550 ◦C in argon for 30 minutes, potentially supplying the reaction with more energy to overcome the differences in bonding between metals in a nitridebased MAX phase [46]. To remove residues and excess fluorides after etching, the powders were mixed with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solutions and repeatedly washed to remove the compounds. Using molten salts to etch Si from Ti3SiC2 has been reported; however, the material after etching did not result in Ti3C2 MXene and was identified as nonstoichiometric Ti–C rock salt structures [50]."

It is best to note that if the alkaline treatments did succeed in selective etching of Al from Ti3AlC2, it would result in the formation of aluminum oxide/hydroxide layers on the surface, instead of producing Ti3C2 alone, and would require an additional step to clean the surface and remove these compounds [51].\nOne of the first reports of synthesis by hydrothermal treatment used a mixture of Ti3AlC2 and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave while heating at 150 ◦C for 24 hours [52]. Through the combination of alkali and hydrothermal treatments, fluoride-free etchants have been proposed, such as using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) followed by H2SO4 hydrothermal treatment. In this case, the Al layers were only removed from the outer surface of Ti3AlC2 resulting in an incomplete etching [53]. More recently, Ti3C2 was reported to be synthesized through the alkali-assisted hydrothermal treatment of Ti3AlC2 in concentrated NaOH, where the resulting material is free of fluorine terminations [38]. In this treatment, also known as the Bayer process, concentrated NaOH solutions were used under elevated temperatures and pressures to readily attack Al layers in Ti3AlC2 through oxidation of Al into aluminum oxide/hydroxides followed by dissolution of the aluminum compounds into the alkali solution, leaving a Ti3C2 MXene terminated with only -OH and -O groups [38]."

This may be due to the lowest reduction potential of Al in comparison to all other A elements and thus the ability of HF-based etchants to weaken the M–A (A = Al) bonds in contrast to other A elements, such as Si, Ge, In, or Sn. This may also explain why Ti3AlC2 is the precursor of choice to synthesize Ti3C2, rather than Ti3SiC2 or Ti3GeC2, for example (Table 5.1).\nThe first MXene produced through the selective etching of a layered precursor which contained an A element other than Al was Mo2C from Mo2Ga2C, a nonMAX phase precursor (Table 5.2). Since the etching of Ga from Mo2Ga2C, HF etching of the A layer other than Al from Mn+1AXn systems has been a challenge [7]. This has been hypothesized to be because of differences in etching kinetics and dissolution of the A layer by HF [5]. For example, HF is known to etch and dissolve Al as well as SiO2 but not Si [57]. However, more recently, it was found that exposure of Ti3SiC2 to etchants consisting of HF/oxidant mixtures led to the etching of a non-Al layer from Mn+1AXn and Ti3C2 was synthesized (Fig. 5.4\n78 K.

Various oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ammonium persulfate, potassium permanganates, iron tetrachlorides, and nitric acid were mixed separately with HF, and all have shown selectivity to etching Si from Ti3SiC2 [56].

Delamination often occurs in MXene through a process of intercalation, or insertion of cations, organic molecules, or large organic bases [28, 30, 59, 60], followed by washing, optional sonication, and centrifugation to separate delaminated materials from those materials which stay as multilayered powders."

Depending on the MXene, it is possible that the degradation mechanisms may be different; however, in the presence of water, Ti3C2 MXene degrades to a cloudy-white solution of anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) [70]. Degradation determines the lifetime of the material and the resulting properties; therefore, efforts focused on methods to control, suppress, or stop oxidation of the material are necessary.\nSpecifically, the environment where the solution is stored plays a critical role in its self-life. It was shown that material dispersed in deionized water, stored in air at ambient temperature, degraded faster than samples stored in argon-sealed vials at low temperature (~4 ◦C), which remained almost unchanged over the course of 28 days [71]. It is best to note that this process is dependent on concentration and higher-concentration solutions will degrade slower than their low-concentration\n5 Top-Down MXene Synthesis (Selective Etching) 81\ncounterparts. Another way to mitigate or slow oxidation is to use organic solvents – keeping the material away from an aqueous environment [61]. Therefore, while the material degrades over time, there are strategies to overcome the fast degradation and keep material for longer periods of time (>1 month).\n82 K. Maleski and M. Alhabeb"

Graphene, a comparable 2D material, can be mass-produced in both large-scale growth or large-scale exfoliation; however, liquid exfoliation techniques require either organic solvent dispersions, surfactants, or polymer/protein stabilizers to achieve high concentrations [72–75]. In comparison, the synthesis of MXenes is scalable, and a single batch of ~100 g of Ti3C2 using laboratory pilot plants was achieved utilizing wet-selective etching and exfoliation techniques [14].

      "text" : "Two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides synthesized since 2011 have largely relied on wet chemical etching to selectively remove A elements from the bulk layered precursors. From the top-down synthesis routes, various MXene compositions are available and new compositions are appearing rapidly. Even within the same MXene and layered precursor (e.g., Ti3C2 from Ti3AlC2), there are many ways to selectively etch the material, each resulting in slightly different surface terminations, properties, and target applications.\nIn general, the synthesis and processing can be tuned for each MXene to create material which is best for the job. For electronic applications, where less defects and large area flakes are necessary, less aggressive and harsh etchants are suggested, to produce free-standing films or thin films which are highly conductive (similar to metals). Less defective and large flakes have been used or theoretically predicted to be promising in optic, electronic, and electromagnetic applications (Chap. 7) such as transistors, transparent conductors, broadband and nonlinear saturable absorbers, photonic diodes, femtosecond lasers, terahertz detectors, and electromagnetic interference shielding, where conductivity and thin film uniformity play a vital role in the performance. In opposition, nanometer-scale flakes which are smaller in lateral size and exhibit more edges available for reactions or plasmonic activity will be applicable in applications such as catalysis, gas sensing, SERS substrates, light to heat materials, and biomedical photothermal therapy. The broad spectrum of applications of MXenes shows the diversity in possible properties (Fig. 5.7) [76].\nIn summary, material properties and promising applications are strongly dependent on synthesis method, morphology, structure, and composition of the MXene as well as the quantity and type of surface termination. Future investigations may include the effect of precursor on properties, synthesis of termination-free MXenes with pristine surfaces, the production and characterization of more carbonitride and nitride MXenes, and the optimization of top-down synthesis routes which utilize selective etching of layered precursors with non-Al A elements. Advances toward MXene materials with controllable and tunable properties has been realized through optimization of top-down synthesis methods over the course of the past 8 years; however, progress is inevitable, warranted, and essential to continue development of this large family of two-dimensional materials.\n84 K.

      "text" : "In Chap. 5, a top-down method is introduced for synthesizing a series of MXenes, the functionalized 2D transition metal carbides (TMCs) and nitrides (TMNs). This method is easy to scale up for mass production. However, the use of HF or LiF/HCl solution in this process makes the MXene surface terminated with various functional groups and introduces defects [1]. Moreover, the mechanical vibration or sonication would make the MXene smaller and introduce more defects. These chemical modification and mechanical damage of MXenes have hindered the studies on the intrinsic properties of 2D TMCs and TMNs. In addition, the structure and species of MXenes are limited by the mother 3D MAX phase materials. As summarized in Ref. [1], all the MXenes synthesized up to now have structures of M2X, M3X2, and M4X3. However, this method could not be used to synthesize MXenes with MX structure such as MoC, MoN, NbC, NbN, etc. These MX-structured materials are an important class of TMCs and TMNs with many intriguing properties, in which those with rock salt structure are mostly superconductors with high transition temperature [2] and those with simple hexagonal WC structure have been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated to be topological semimetals [3–5]. Therefore, developing new synthesis methods is highly desired for improving the quality and expanding the family of 2D TMCs and TMNs.\nMechanical exfoliation [6] is the most reliable method for synthesizing highquality 2D materials from their 3D counterparts that have layered structure attracted with weak van der Waals force between the adjacent layers. Unfortunately, mechanical exfoliation is infeasible for the synthesis of 2D TMCs and TMNs because\nC. Xu · L. Chen · Z. Liu · H.-M. Cheng · W.

Xu et al.\nboth TMCs and TMNs are non-layered materials [2]. Alternatively, bottom-up synthesis method has been widely demonstrated to be an efficient way to synthesize a broad range of 2D materials including graphene, h-BN, and transition metal chalcogenides. Compared to top-down synthesis methods, bottom-up methods are more suitable for the synthesis of large-area high-quality 2D materials. In addition, these methods are very flexible and, for instance, can be used to directly grow heterostructures of 2D materials. More importantly, these methods can grow atomically thin non-layered materials. Recently, a variety of bottom-up methods have been developed to synthesize various 2D TMCs and TMNs [7–20], including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), template method, and plasma-enhanced pulsed laser deposition (PEPLD). This has greatly promoted the studies on the intrinsic structure and properties as well as technological applications of 2D TMCs and TMNs [7–10, 13–18, 20–23].\nIn this chapter, we will first introduce the three bottom-up synthesis methods of 2D TMCs (including their heterostructures with graphene) and 2D TMNs. Then, the microstructure of the samples synthesized by these methods will be discussed. Finally, their properties, in particular superconductivity, and applications including electrocatalysts, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors will be introduced."

      "text" : "Chemical Vapor Deposition: 2D TMCs and TMNs\nIn 2015, Xu et al. [7] first reported a CVD method to fabricate high-quality ultrathin 2D TMC crystals by using a bilayer metal foil substrate. Figure 6.1a shows the schematic of the CVD process of 2D Mo2C crystals and the atomic model of 2D Mo2C crystals with different thicknesses. An ultrathin Cu foil (10 μm thick) was first stacked on the top of a Mo foil as the growth substrate, and then the substrate was heated to above the melting point of copper (1085 ◦C) in hydrogen (H2), which enables the diffusion of Mo atoms to the liquid copper surface. Subsequently, a very low concentration methane (CH4) was introduced to provide carbon atoms by decomposition on Cu surface, which react with the Mo atoms to form 2D Mo2C crystals. Figure 6.1b shows the ultrathin 2D α-Mo2C crystals fabricated at 1090 ◦C for 5 min [7]. Most crystals have a lateral size of ~10 μm and a thickness of 3– 20 nm. The nucleation density, thickness, and lateral size of 2D α-Mo2C crystals can be controlled by changing the growth time and temperature. In addition, ultrathin αMo2C crystals can be transferred to other substrates, such as SiO2/Si substrates or transmission electron microscope (TEM) grids, by using a mild Cu etchant. The crystal was identified to be orthorhombic structure (α-Mo2C) by selective area electron diffraction (SAED). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings show the uniform chemical composition of the crystal (Fig. 6.1c–e). Furthermore, no defects are observed (Fig. 6.1f), indicating the high crystalline\n6 Bottom-Up Synthesis of 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides 91\n92 C. Xu et al.\nquality. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicate that the crystals have clean and smooth surface (Fig. 6.1g). Importantly, this CVD method is versatile and can be used to fabricate a broad class of high-quality 2D ultrathin TMC crystals with various structures. For example, high-quality 2D ultrathin hexagonal WC and cubic TaC crystals have also been fabricated by changing Mo foil to W and Ta foil (Fig. 6.1h, i), respectively.\nGeng et al. [8] used the same method reported by Xu et al. [7] to fabricate 2D Mo2C crystals. A higher temperature (1100 ◦C), a thicker copper foil (at least 50 μm), and various CH4 concentrations (H2 200 sccm, CH4 0.1–0.4 sccm) were used in their work. They found that the Mo2C crystals have different shapes under different CH4 concentrations. For example, when the flow rate of CH4 was 0.1 sccm, the Mo2C crystals with fractal shape were fabricated. With increasing the flow rate of CH4, the crystal shape changes from fractal to hexagon (Fig. 6.1j). The hexagonal Mo2C crystal has a different crystalline structure from others (Fig. 6.1k). At CH4 flow rates of 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm, the dominant shapes are rectangle and pentagon, respectively. With increasing the thickness of copper foil, the Mo2C crystal became thinner. This is because a thicker copper layer prolongs the diffusion time of Mo, resulting in a less segregation on the liquid copper surface.\nBased on Xu’s work, Wang et al. [9] fabricated ultrathin TaN with NH3 as nitrogen source and Cu foil/Ta foil as growth substrate at a temperature of 1077 ◦C, which is lower than the melting point of Cu. During CVD growth, the copper foil keeps solid state. Figure 6.1l shows low-magnification TEM images of TaN, and the inset shows the corresponding SAED pattern, which confirms that both of them are single crystals. Besides TaN crystals, ultrathin TaB crystals were also fabricated by using boron powder as B source. The reason why the ultrathin crystals can be fabricated at a temperature below the melting point of Cu was explained in this work. Using DFT calculations, they found that a very low excess energy of 0.03 eV is required for a Ta atom diffusing into a vacant Cu lattice site, which can be easily supplied thermally at a lower temperature (e.g., kBT ≈ 129 meV at 1356 K). Furthermore, they found that the Ta atoms would prefer to form clusters in Cu lattice rather than being uniformly distributed at a higher temperature. Therefore, at a lower temperature, the growth of these crystals can be controlled more easily than at a higher temperature.\nQi et al. [10] reported the growth of monatomic layer ReC crystal on Re (0001) substrates by CVD with C2H4 as carbon source under ultrahigh vacuum condition. They found that monolayer graphene was grown on Re (0001) at 903 K. When the grown graphene on Re (0001) was annealed at 953–1113 K, it began to decompose to carbon atoms, which were then dissolved in Re. Subsequently, during the cooling process, 2D ReC crystals with a periodic “flower-like” superstructure were formed on Re (0001) surface through carbon segregation from Re (Fig. 6.1m). Unfortunately, the 2D ReC crystals separated from the growth substrate were not obtained in this work.\n6 Bottom-Up Synthesis of 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides 93\nChemical Vapor Deposition: Graphene/2D TMC"

      "text" : "As we know, CVD has been widely used to synthesize high-quality graphene film on copper foils [24]. Therefore, the CVD method shown above has been directly used or modified to synthesize graphene/2D TMC heterostructures [11–15]. Figure 6.2a shows a schematic diagram of one-step CVD process for the growth of vertical graphene (top)/2D α-Mo2C (bottom) heterostructures [11]. Compared to the synthesis process of 2D TMCs, a higher concentration of CH4 was used [11– 14]. Figure 6.2b, c, respectively, shows the optical image and Raman spectra of the graphene/2D α-Mo2C vertical heterostructure reported by Deng et al. [11]. The visible D band indicates the low quality of the graphene in the heterostructures. Similar graphene (top)/2D α-Mo2C (bottom) heterostructure was also synthesized by Qiao et al. with the same method [12]. They found that there is a twist angle of ~11◦ between graphene and 2D α-Mo2C (Fig. 6.2d) and suggested that the low quality of graphene is ascribed to the strong bonding between the Mo in 2D αMo2C and the C atoms in graphene. Different from the above two works, Geng et al. [14] reported the growth of 2D α-Mo2C (top)/graphene (bottom) heterostructures by one-step CVD. Figure 6.1e shows a supposed schematic for the growth of Mo2C flakes on graphene.\nXu et al. [13] developed a two-step CVD process to synthesize high-quality graphene (top)/2D α-Mo2C (bottom) vertical heterostructures. Figure 6.2f shows the schematic diagram of the two-step CVD growth process. In general, graphene was first grown on the top of the solid Cu/Mo substrate at 1070 ◦C. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to 1090 ◦C, and 2D α-Mo2C crystals were formed between graphene and the liquid Cu/Mo substrate under this condition. Figure 6.2g shows the graphene/2D α-Mo2C heterostructures on Cu/Mo substrate. These heterostructures can also be transferred very well to other substrates such as SiO2/Si (Fig. 6.2h). Same as the pure 2D α-Mo2C crystals [7], the 2D α-Mo2C crystals in the heterostructures have high quality (Fig. 6.2i). Figure 6.2j, k shows TEM image and the corresponding SAED pattern of a heterostructure of graphene with an octagonal 2D α-Mo2C crystal, respectively. It can be found that the Mo sublattices of 2D α-Mo2C and graphene show the same lattice orientation. Furthermore, the graphene in heterostructure shows a large upshift in both G and 2D peaks (Fig. 6.2l), and the upshift is non-uniform across the whole heterostructure (Fig. 6.2m–o). These results suggest that the graphene undergoes non-uniform compression in the heterostructure although it has a high quality (Fig. 6.2l).\n2D in-plane WC-graphene (2D i-WC-G) heterostructure can also be synthesized by the one step CVD process. Zeng et al. [15] obtained 2D i-WC-G heterostructure at 980–1020 ◦C by using Ga droplet instead of Cu foil and CH4 as carbon source. Figure 6.2p shows the schematic growth process of 2D i-WC-G heterostructure. The formation of 2D i-WC-G heterostructure was supposed as the result of cosegregation of the WC and graphene. The coverages of 2D WC in 2D i-WC-G heterostructure can be controlled from 40% to 95%. Figure 6.2q shows a SEM image of 2D i-WC-G heterostructure with a high 2D WC coverage. 2D WC crystals have a thickness of ~1.36 nm and high quality, as shown in Fig. 6.2r, s.\n94 C.

First, the 2D hexagonal MoO3-coated NaCl (2D h-MoO3@NaCl) crystals were synthesized by annealing the Mo precursor@NaCl crystals under the protection of Ar atmosphere at 280 ◦C (Fig. 6.3a). Subsequently, 2D hMoO3@NaCl crystals were slowly ammoniated by NH3 at 650 ◦C to synthesize 2D MoN@NaCl powders. Finally, 2D MoN nanosheets (NSs) were obtained by removing NaCl with deionized water. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that the 2D MoN NSs have hexagonal structure with lattice constants a = b = 5.75 Å and c = 5.62 Å (Fig. 6.3b). They show a good dispersity in water (the inset in Fig. 6.3b), and the lateral size and thickness are several hundreds nanometers and 0.71 nm, respectively (Fig. 6.3c,d). 2D WN NSs and VN NSs were also synthesized by this method.\nJoshi et al. [17] reported a two-step template method to synthesize 2D layered δMoN NSs (Fig. 6.3e). In step 1, they synthesized highly aligned 2D layered MoO3 NSs by a hot-filament CVD (HFCVD) process, in which a Mo wire was resistively heated close to its melting point in O2 and the obtained 2D layered MoO3 NSs were deposited on a cooler substrate. In step 2, 2D layered MoO3 NSs were ammoniated to obtain 2D δ-MoN NSs in NH3/Ar (flow rate ratio of 1:4) at 700 ◦C for 8 h. Figure 6.3f shows the MoO3 and δ-MoN samples on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate. It can be found that the color changed from bluish white to black after nitridation. The as-synthesized 2D δ-MoN NSs have layered structure (Fig. 6.3g), a lateral size of 20–30 μm, and a thickness of 5–40 nm.\nJia et al.

First, MoO2 NSs were synthesized through a chemical vapor reduction of commercial MoO3 powders in Ar/H2 (200 sccm, ratio of 9:1) at 900 ◦C for 60 min. Second, the N-Mo2C NSs were synthesized by calcining a C2H4N4 powders/MoO2 NSs (the weight ratio of 10:1) mixture at 450 ◦C for 2 h and then 700 ◦C for 2 h.

Bottom-up synthesized 2D TMCs and TMNs basically inherit the crystalline structures of their bulk counterparts. Ultrathin 2D Mo2C crystals have attracted much attention due to the novel material synthetic strategy and 2D superconductivity since the pioneer work by Xu et al. [7], and subsequently several bottom-up methods have been developed. So far, the asfabricated 2D Mo2C crystals show three crystalline structures including hexagonal (P63/mmc) [8, 14, 18, 21], orthorhombic (Pbcn) [7, 11–13, 21–23], and cubic (Fm3m) [19, 20] phases. Orthorhombic (α) and hexagonal (β) Mo2C crystals are common phases, and both consist of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) Mo atoms and interstitial carbon atoms which occupy half of the Mo octahedrons [21, 23]. Figure 6.5a shows the aberration-corrected bright field (BF)-STEM image of ultrathin αMo2C crystals, which clearly show the graphene-like Mo six rings and carbon atoms located in the centers of Mo six rings from the projected direction [23]. The projected structure of β phase is identical to α phase (Fig. 6.5b, c). However, the carbon atoms are orderly arranged in Mo octahedrons in α-Mo2C while randomly distributed in β-Mo2C. Therefore, the Mo sublattice of α-Mo2C slightly deviates from the strict hexagonal symmetry into an orthorhombic symmetry. Although the distortion of Mo HCP lattice in α-Mo2C is too small to be seen by the naked eyes, it can be identified from reciprocal space. Figure 6.5d shows the difference\n6 Bottom-Up Synthesis of 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides 99\nof electron diffraction (ED) between α- and β-Mo2C, and superstructure ED spots can be clearly seen in α phase [21].\nIt has been reported that α-Mo2C can be transformed from β-Mo2C during the cooling process, and the carbon atoms become ordered in this phase transition [25].

Xu et al.\nof an ultrathin α-Mo2C crystal, in which only the area I was subjected to largedose EBI. During EBI, carbon atoms migrate from zigzag configuration to random occupation, and the distorted HCP configuration of Mo atoms relaxes to rigorous HCP configuration. First-principle calculations show that carbon atom migration parallel to electron beam incident direction has minimal energy barrier. As a result, area I was transformed from α to β phase after EBI as shown in Fig. 6.5f. With the help of advanced aberration-corrected STEM, EBI provides a valid strategy to construct lateral junction of 2D superconducting α/β Mo2C with sharp interface [21], which provides a promising platform for studying vortex physics at the nanoscale and investigating the catalytic synergistic effects between α and β phases at the interface.\nAs shown above, Zhang et al. [20] synthesized Mo2C thin film with a FCC structure by PEPLD. In comparison to “ABAB”-stacked Mo atomic layers in αand β-Mo2C, FCC-structured Mo2C has “ABCABC”-stacked Mo atomic layers. All these three structures have almost identical interplanar spacing of closed-packed Mo atomic planes. However, the occupation of carbon atoms in FCC-Mo2C is unclear although the space group ( Fm3m ) and lattice parameter (a = 0.415 nm) are determined (Fig. 6.5g). Taking advantage of metal immiscibility route, Xu et al. [7] and Wang et al. [9] synthesized 2D TaC crystals with rock salt structure (Fig. 6.5h). Wang et al. [9] pointed out that the morphology of 2D TaC crystals suggests a pyramidal growth in the normal direction. In contrast to the AB-stacked metal atoms in α- and β-Mo2C, W atoms in the CVD-fabricated 2D WC crystals have AA-stacked pattern, and carbon atoms are located in the centers of tungsten trigonal prismatic interstices (Fig. 6.5i) [7, 15]. Recently, unique three-component fermions have been observed in the WC-structured crystals [4, 5]. Qi et al. [10] demonstrated the synthesis of ReC on Re substrate. Although the projected structure of ReC is the same as WC, carbon and Re atoms in ReC have the coplanar structure in 2D limit (Fig. 6.5j).\nTo date, two kinds of 2D TMNs, MoN and TaN, have been synthesized by bottom-up synthesis method. 2D MoN crystals derived from the ammoniation of MoO3 [16, 17] have hexagonal structure with space group P63mc. In this structure, Mo skeleton has “AA”-stacked pattern with some atomic columns slightly misaligned, and nitrogen atoms are located in Mo trigonal prismatic interstices, but the adjacent nitrogen atomic layers perpendicular to [0001] direction are not located in the projected coincident trigonal prisms (Fig. 6.5k). The as-obtained 2D TaN crystals were identified to have space group of P6/mmm with lattice parameters of a = b = 0.5196 nm and c = 0.2911 nm (Fig. 6.5l) [9]."

If these equivalent carbon atom configurations exist simultaneously in the same Mo atom sublattice, topological α-Mo2C domains could form. Liu et al.

Therefore, there is a small shear strain across the domain boundary (Fig. 6.6c, d) [23]. However, such domain boundary has a significant influence on the superconductivity, resulting in a broad resistive superconducting transition with two distinct transition processes due to the formation of localized phase-slip events in the boundary [23].\nIntrinsically, Mo atoms should have “ABAB”-stacked configuration in β-Mo2C. However, Geng et al. [8] observed two types of Mo stacking order, i.e., AB and AA at the thinner edge of hexagonal-shaped β-Mo2C nanosheet (Fig. 6.6e), and suggested that the coexistence of multiple stacking is attributed to the incomplete growth of Mo2C at the edge and the similar formation energy for the two polytypes. Moreover, Geng et al. [14] also observed stacking fault in β-Mo2C nanosheet. As shown in Fig. 6.6f, additional Mo atoms appear in the centers of projected graphenelike Mo six rings. That is, there exists Mo atomic plane of local “C” layer besides “A” and “B” layers. Jia et al. [18] found that nitrogen atoms could replace carbon atoms in 2D β-Mo2C, forming N-doped β-Mo2C crystals, and the lattice parameter ratio a/b in β-Mo2C crystals decreases after N doping (Fig. 6.6g, h)."

On the one hand, TMCs and TMNs have been widely used in jet engines, cutting tools, and protective coatings because of their high melting points, extreme hardness, and good wear resistance. On the other hand, they have unique electronic and magnetic properties, which render them superconductivity and excellent catalytic activity comparable to noble metals [26].

      "text" : "The transport properties of CVD-grown 2D α-Mo2C crystals were first investigated by Xu et al. [7]. Figure 6.7a shows the temperature dependence of the sheet resistance of a 7.5-nm-thick Mo2C crystal in different magnetic field strengths perpendicular to the crystal plane. At zero magnetic field, the resistance begins to decrease at 3.6 K and drops to zero at 2.76 K, indicating the onset of superconductivity. Figure 6.7b shows the magnetic field dependence of the sheet resistance for an 8.3-nm-thick Mo2C crystal. As the magnetic field is tilted toward the crystal plane (θ → 0), the transition to superconductivity shifts sharply to a higher field. Such strong anisotropy provides direct evidence of the 2D character of the superconductivity for ultrathin α-Mo2C crystals. The out-of-plane upper critical\n6 Bottom-Up Synthesis of 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides 103\nfield Hc2,⊥ shows a linear behavior close to Tc (Fig. 6.7c), which is consistent with the standard linearized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for superconductors. The extracted in-plane coherence length, ξGL(0)~22.0 ± 0.4 nm, is much larger\n104 C. Xu et al.\nthan the extracted superconducting thickness, dSC ≈ 4.1 ± 0.1 nm. Moreover, the angular dependence of upper critical field, Hc2(θ ), can be well fitted by the Tinkham formula (Fig. 6.7d), and the current voltage (I − V) curves comply well with Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory (Fig. 6.7e). All these results confirm the 2D nature of the superconductivity in ultrathin α-Mo2C crystals. Moreover, these crystals are clean system in terms of the much larger mean free path (~30–40 nm) than the coherence length. As shown in Fig. 6.7f, the superconductivity behavior strongly depends on the crystal thickness. A suppression of the superconducting transition is observed as the crystal goes thinner.\nWang et al. [22] found that the magnetoresistance (MR) of 2D α-Mo2C crystals exhibits well-resolved and pronounced fluctuations (Fig. 6.7g) and the fluctuations are reproducible and do not depend on the direction of the field sweep. Unlike the well-known Little-Parks (LP) effect, where oscillations are prominent in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, the resistance oscillations in the 2D αMo2C crystals occur only at low magnetic fields and low temperatures far below Tc. This abnormal phenomenon is explained by the triangle-shaped smooth terraces on the Mo2C crystal surface, whose geometrical area matches well with the observed loop area from MR oscillations and could act as an effective geometry enclosed by the screening currents. At temperatures lower than 2.6 K, the MR is negative and exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic field (Fig. 6.7h), which is contrary to a picture of weak localization. This result implies that amplitude fluctuations also play a crucial role in controlling Tc in ultrathin Mo2C crystals.\nXu et al. [13] studied the transport properties of the CVD-grown well-aligned and strongly coupled graphene/2D α-Mo2C crystal heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 6.7i, multiple voltage steps (marked by arrows) are observed in the intermediate current regime, undergoing a transition between the superconducting state and normal state. These voltage steps are producible and more pronounced and sharper at lower temperatures. In contrast, pure 2D α-Mo2C crystal samples exhibit a sharp superconducting transition, and no step-like feature is observed. Moreover, such multiple voltage steps have also not been observed in the stacked graphene/2D superconductor heterostructures or hybrids reported. The voltage steps can be understood in terms of the existence of strain-induced phase-slip lines, a 2D analogue of phase-slip centers. Superconductor-normal-superconductor junction devices were also constructed by using two closely located strongly coupled graphene/2D α-Mo2C crystal heterostructures with graphene as the weak link. A dissipationless supercurrent through the junction is clearly observed below the critical current Ic, which is a characteristic DC Josephson response due to the proximity effect (Fig. 6.7j). The high-quality graphene/2D α-Mo2C shows a high transparency of ~0.7–0.8 extracted by BTK theory. It can be seen that the critical current is periodically modulated by the magnetic field (Fig. 6.7k), exhibiting typical Fraunhofer-like diffraction pattern. Qiao et al. [12] also carried out spectroscopic measurements on graphene and 2D superconducting α-Mo2C heterostructure using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). They found that Tc and Hc2(T) of the heterostructure could be tuned by simply varying the thickness of 2D α-Mo2C sheets. These results indicate that hybrid graphene-superconductor\n6 Bottom-Up Synthesis of 2D Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides 105\ndevices are attractive for fundamental investigations of rich phase diagram of superconducting transition and provide a facile route to tune the superconductivity in the 2D limit."

As shown in Fig. 6.8a, the 2D i-WC-G sample with 70% coverage requires only ~120 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm−2 current density, and Tafel slope is as low as ~38 mV dec−1 (Fig. 6.8b), probably demonstrating\n106 C. Xu et al.\na Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance is only 2.26 at 250 mV (Fig. 6.8c), which affords faster charge transfer and promotes the HER kinetic process. The excellent performance of 2D i-WC-G heterostructures could be attributed to the synergetic effect between WC and graphene, where the electron conjugation across the 2D basal surface is more favorable than traditional configuration of stacked and aggregated heterostructure and exhibits fast interdomain electron transport (Fig. 6.8d). Geng et al. [14] studied the electrochemical HER activity of Mo2C crystals grown on graphene. Benefiting from the high crystallinity and electronic coupling to graphene, the HER performance is dramatically improved. As shown in Fig. 6.8e, the Mo2C/graphene electrode has a low overpotential value of 236 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with an onset potential of 87 mV and Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1, showing a more superior HER performance as compared to transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D materials. It also exhibits high stability, where the polarization curve remains unchanged even after 1000 cycles (Fig. 6.8f). Jia et al. [18] investigated the HER performance of porous N-Mo2C NSs. Under the optimized condition, the samples show an onset potential of −48.3 mV, overpotential of 99 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6.8g), and Tafel slope of 44.5 mV dec−1 (Fig. 6.8h). Moreover, the hydrogen production rate is 6.23 mmol mg−1 h−1, which is almost the same as the theoretical result (Fig. 6.8i), indicating that the Faradaic efficiency is nearly 100%. The excellent HER performance of N-Mo2C NSs is attributed to their 2D structure with large electrochemical area that facilitate the diffusion process, particular crystalline phase and high-proportioned C planes that expose more Mo active sites, and the synergistic manipulation of N doping with the electron density states that produce more active sites."

At fast cycling rate at 1 C, a steady discharge capacity of 180 mAh/g is obtained and shows no significant degradation even up to 100 cycles (inset of Figure 6.9a). The good cycling stability suggests that the Li+ are probably inserted at the interlayer spacing without reaction with the host lattice; thus no significant changes are involved.

The materials obtained have high crystalline quality, which are different from MXenes.

However, it is still challenging to synthesize large-area uniform films and atomically thin samples down to one unit cell thick. Furthermore, more efforts should be made to explore the properties and applications of such high-quality 2D TMCs and TMNs.\nReferences\n1. Anasori, B., Lukatskaya, M. R., & Gogotsi, Y.

      "text" : "Since the discovery of 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitride MXenes, methods have been developed to optimize and control their synthesis. Two-dimensional MXenes are generally synthesized through the selective etching of the parent MAX phase using etchants based on acidic fluoride solution [1, 2]. However, the specific etchant and etching parameters used can directly influence the structure and chemistry of the resultant MXene, which will ultimately affect the physicochemical properties. For example, the concentration and moiety of etchants [2, 3], etching temperature [4], and starting particle size of the MAX phase precursor [4, 5] have been shown to affect the required etching times and the processing of MXenes. Therefore, optimizing synthesis methods requires a deep understanding of how these parameters influence the micro- and atomic structure of the resulting MXenes. In this chapter, we review advances from recent literature on the influence of synthesis methods on the crystal structure [6], nanopores [7, 8], atomic defects\nX.

      "text" : "An ideal etching process can completely remove the “A” element atoms without over-etching the 2D MXene flakes. The extraction of the “A” element leads to the formation of functional groups of various types and concentrations [10] and ion and water intercalation [11], each of which is accompanied with change of the clattice constant that can readily be measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) [6, 10, 11]. Analysis of the lattice constant change can therefore reveal important information about the crystal structure, interlayer structure, and surface structure. A systematic study was performed on samples etched using 50 wt% hydrofluoric (HF) acid as a function of etching time and temperature [4]. As summarized in Table 7.1, longer etching times and higher etching temperatures lead to larger c-lattice constants. Lattice constant measurements are a convenient way to tell if sufficient etching has been conducted to ensure a high yield rate of 2D MXenes. Another study by Wang et al. [10] reported that the lattice constant of wet Ti3C2Tx MXene is significantly larger than dry Ti3C2Tx MXene, which is likely due to water intercalation from the complex interactions between water molecules, surface functional groups, and the HF solution. Water intercalation has been reported to increase the interlayer spacing of V2CTx, Nb2CTx [5], and Nb4C3Tx MXenes [12]. Due to the fact that the c-lattice constant is sensitive to many factors such as drying conditions, which are sometimes uncontrollable, conclusions should be carefully drawn from such studies.\nThe influence of water intercalation on the lattice constants is coupled with ion intercalation [11]. The d-spacing of dry K+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene (11.5 Å) is\n7 Effect of Synthesis Methods on the Structure and Defects. . . 113\nlarger than that of dry Mg2+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene (10.1 Å). After hydration, the d-spacing of wet K+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene (12.4 Å) is smaller than that of dry Mg2+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene (14.6 Å) due to the formation of large Mg(H2O)6 clusters that separate adjacent layers [11].\nThe lattice constants can be easily obtained through conventional XRD analysis and are sensitive to the sample preparation methods employed, providing interlayer spacing information that can be used to understand the surface structure and intercalation mechanism [11]. The lattice constant is correlated to certain properties. For example, the Ti3C2Tx MXene sample etched with 10 wt% HF has a large clattice constant and also the highest Cr(VI) removal capacity, which is useful for reductive removal of other highly toxic, soluble, and strong oxidants [6]. Therefore, controlling the lattice constant using different synthesis methods can influence the functional properties of MXenes."

      "text" : "Besides etching out the “A” atom layers (Al, Ga, etc.), the etchants can also attack the carbide layers from complex chemical reactions, leaving defects in the MXenes flakes. As a commonly observed type of defects in chemically etched MXene [7, 8], nanopores can influence ion transport properties for applications such as water desalination [13, 14]. Nanopores were initially observed at atomic resolution in Ta4C3Tx MXene after an HF (50 wt%) treatment for 72 hr. [7], where the average size of the reported nanopores was less than 3 nm and their formation was attributed to over-etching from using an etchant solution with a relatively high HF concentration. The influence of the synthesis method on the average nanopore size has been systematically investigated using Mo2CTx MXenes prepared using different etching times, intercalation methods, and sonication times (Fig. 7.1) [8]. The pore size increases from ∼10 nm to hundreds of nanometers as the etching time increases from 6 days to 16 days (Fig. 7.1a, b). Halim et al. [8] claimed that postetching treatment using TBAOH significantly increases the number of nanopores with a negligible influence on the pore size (Fig. 7.1c). Sonication after intercalation also increases the pore size but tends to destroy the flakes (Fig. 7.1d). Therefore, such experiments not only provide direct evidence of the existence of defects in MXenes from etching but also indicate that defects can be controlled by tuning critical parameters during synthesis.\nIt is interesting to investigate the influence of the synthesis method on the creation of smaller-scale defects: atomic defects such as vacancies and antisites. Atomic defects in 2D materials can directly influence the electronic structure, which in turn determines the electronic properties, optical properties, and magnetic properties [16–18]. Controlling the type and concentration of atomic defects in 2D materials to enhance physical properties through sample preparation and treatment has been extensively investigated for graphene and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides [19].\n114 X. Sang et al.\nTo directly observe and quantitatively analyze atomic defects in 2D materials, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been the method of choice as STEM offers sub-angstrom spatial resolution that is sufficient to resolve individual atoms in 2D materials [20]. The STEM images can easily be interpreted as the image intensity is proportional to the atomic number Z1.64 [19–21]. In STEM images, heavier atoms exhibit brighter contrast, while lighter atoms exhibit darker contrast. Due to the sensitivity of STEM images to the number and type of atoms, different atomic defects exhibit drastically different image contrast that can be used to determine their type and density.\nThe influence of the etchant concentration on atomic defect formation in monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene has been investigated using atomic-resolution aberrationcorrected STEM [9]. As STEM images represent the projected atomic structure model, atomic defects are preferably characterized from monolayer flakes. Defects in multilayer flakes are more difficult to quantitatively analyze because the contrast of atomic defects becomes less obvious as more atoms overlap along the projection direction. To confirm the monolayer nature of the Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes prepared using the minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) method (see Chap. 5 “Top-Down MXene Synthesis” for more detail) [2], multiple STEM images were acquired from different viewing directions to reveal the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure. This is in principle similar to atomic-resolution tomography, which\n7 Effect of Synthesis Methods on the Structure and Defects. . . 115\nhas been successfully used to reveal the 3D atomic structure of nanoparticles [22]. The STEM image acquired along the c axis (Fig. 7.2, β = 0) displays the hexagonal lattice of projected Ti atoms. Carbon atoms are not visible here due to their much lower atom number compared with Ti and overlapping with Ti atoms in this projection. For comparison, theoretical STEM images were simulated for Ti3C2Tx MXene from monolayer (SL), double layer with AA stacking, and double layer with AB stacking [23]. Along the zone axis, it is impossible to determine the layer number because the experimental STEM image matches well with all three simulated STEM images. The STEM image acquired along an orientation slightly off the c axis (Fig. 7.2, β = −189 mrad) shows a hollow-square pattern, which only matches the SL structure, while both double-layer AA and AB structures exhibit blurred contrast resulting from overlapping of the two layers. This unambiguously proves that the examined Ti3C2Tx MXene flake is SL, thereby providing the opportunity to directly observe atomic defects.\nThe most prevalent atomic defects in Ti3C2Tx MXene are Ti vacancies. Fig. 7.3a shows an experimental STEM image where the dark contrast indicated by the white arrow represents one missing Ti atom, i.e., a Ti vacancy, VTi. The dark contrast of VTi in the STEM image is confirmed by the theoretical STEM image simulated based on a Ti3C2Tx supercell created by removing one Ti atom from the system and optimized using density functional theory (DFT) (Fig. 7.3a). Similar Ti vacancies were observed previously using STEM [24]. The calculated VTi formation energies are 2.842 eV for the two surface Ti layers and 6.485 eV for the inner Ti layer. Therefore, the majority of VTi are expected to be found in the two surface Ti layers and the formation energy of the surface VTi should be dependent on the surface functional groups. As shown in Fig. 7.3c, the vacancy formation energies with all the functional groups are higher than the formation energy on a bare surface. It is very likely that the Ti vacancies are formed on the bare surfaces during HF\n116 X. Sang et al.\netching before the surfaces are terminated by functional groups. Besides isolated Ti vacancies, Ti vacancy clusters are also commonly observed. Figure 7.3b shows a vacancy cluster consisting of 17 Ti vacancies and exhibiting a honeycomb structure. DFT indicates that the formation energy of a vacancy cluster is simply the sum of the formation energies of individual vacancies, suggesting that formation of such Ti vacancy cluster does not introduce an additional formation energy (Fig. 7.3d). Similar to a single Ti vacancy, Ti vacancy clusters should form during the etching process. This leads to the hypothesis that the concentration of Ti vacancies and vacancy clusters can be correlated with the etchant concentration, similar to the formation of nanopores.\nTo validate this hypothesis, atomic defects in monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene samples prepared using the MILD method with different HF concentration, 2.7 wt%, 5.3 wt%, and 7.0 wt%, were systematically investigated. Characteristic STEM images acquired from the three different samples are shown in Fig. 7.4. At a low HF concentration (Fig. 7.4a), the atomic defects are mainly separated single Ti vacancies. Ti vacancy clusters are more commonly observed for medium\n7 Effect of Synthesis Methods on the Structure and Defects. . . 117\n(Fig. 7.4b) and high HF concentration (Fig. 7.4c). A statistical analysis of the defect concentration from tens of STEM images for each condition was performed. The average Ti vacancy concentration with standard deviation is plotted as a function of the HF concentration in Fig. 7.4d. It is obvious that the average defect concentration increases as the HF concentration increases. Moreover, vacancy clusters tend to form at higher HF concentration. This experiment indicates that the atomic defects in Ti3C2Tx MXene critically depend on the sample preparation method used and also confirm that the vacancies are formed during the etching process.\n118 X. Sang et al.\nTi vacancies and vacancy clusters can modify the surface structure. As ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal [9], Ti vacancies in the surface can cause the adjacent Ti atoms in the middle layer to be exposed. Compared to Ti atoms that are blocked by the functional groups, the exposed Ti atoms can act as catalytic active sites. This is similar to the case of 2D TMDs, where atomic defects and edge defects are active sites for hydrogen evolution [25]. DFT calculations demonstrate that the Ti vacancies within the surfaces of Ti3C2Tx MXene do not compromise the excellent conductivity of Ti3C2Tx MXene (Fig. 7.5a) [9]. Rather, DFT simulations show that carbon vacancies in Ti2CTx can enhance electronic conductivity (Fig. 7.5b) [26]. More work needs to be performed to understand how atomic defects can influence other functional properties of Ti3C2Tx and other MXenes [27–29].\n7 Effect of Synthesis Methods on the Structure and Defects. . . 119"

      "text" : "MXenes synthesized using the conventional top-down method through wet chemistry etching always terminate with functional groups such as –OH, –O, and –F. The functional groups in MXenes are important as they directly influence properties such as energy storage capacity [23], magnetism, band gap [30], and surface plasmon resonance [31, 32]. To better control the material properties, understanding the influence of sample preparation on type and concentration of surface functional groups is critical. Although diffraction methods have the advantage of obtaining averaged structural information from a large sample volume, XRD is not sensitive to light elements such as hydrogen and is difficult to quantitatively analyze –OH and hydrogen bonds. Moreover, due to the complexity and inhomogeneity of MXene phase crystal structures such as interlayer spacing and interlayer horizontal shifting after etching, a comprehensive structure model must be constructed to properly represent the MXene structure.\nNeutron diffraction has been utilized to investigate the functional groups of Ti3C2Tx MXene using multilevel structural modeling [10]. Neutron diffraction has the advantage that H atoms are strong scatterers for neutrons, enabling better quantification of –OH functional groups. The multilevel structural modeling provides additional structural details of interest including stacking sequence/disorder, surface species identity, distribution, and interactions compared to conventional smallbox models. Structural analysis through neutron diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) was performed on three samples (HF48, HF10, and HF48-NH4OH) prepared using different synthesis conditions. HF48 and HF10 were prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 powders in 48 wt% HF and 10 wt% HF solutions, respectively. As revealed in the previous section, a higher HF concentration leads to higher nanopore and atomic defect concentration. It is to be expected that other structural parameters could also be influenced by HF concentration. The HF48-NH4OH sample was prepared by soaking HF48 in an aqueous ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution (28–30% NH3 basis) at room temperature.\nPDFs can provide straightforward information about type and number of bonds in materials. PDFs of the three samples were obtained by a Fourier transform of the total scattering structure factor S(Q) up to a Qmax of 25 Å−1 collected using neutron diffraction on the NOMAD beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Fig. 7.6a). All three PDFs show similar positive and negative peaks but with different peak shapes. The first three peaks are a negative peak at 0.97 Å (O–H bond distance), a negative peak at 2.13 Å (Ti–C/O/F bond distance), and a positive peak at 3.04 Å (Ti–Ti and C–C in-plane distance). The peaks from HF10 are generally sharper and narrower than those from HF48 and HF48-NH4OH, suggesting that HF10 has a more ordered crystalline structure. Even for a very large bond distance (r > ∼45 Å), distinct peaks can easily be identified above the noise level from HF10 PDF, while the signal is more or less white noise at a large bond distance for HF48 and HF48-NH4OH. Thus, the MXene structure from the lower HF concentration has better long-range ordering from larger coherent\n120 X. Sang et al.\nlateral dimension of Ti3C2Tx sheets, a lower degree of interlayer stacking error, and fewer Ti defects, which is consistent with results presented in the previous section using atomic-resolution STEM imaging.\nMore details about the crystal structure of the three MXenes can be revealed using multilevel modeling to fit the neutron diffraction PDFs. The discussion is focused on the crystal structure difference between HF10 and HF48 since HF48 and HF48-NH4OH have nearly identical structures except for a slight difference in the c-lattice parameter. The average composition of HF10 and HF48 is Ti3C2[O0.13(1)(OH)1.04(6)F0.83(5)] and Ti3C2[O0.1(1)(OH)0.8(1)F1.1(2)], respectively.\n7 Effect of Synthesis Methods on the Structure and Defects. . . 121\nThe concentration of –F functional groups is higher for HF48 possibly due to replacement of –OH by –F during etching. Moreover, HF10 has a more ordered stacking sequence than HF48. As represented in Fig. 7.6b and d, the relative shift between adjacent layers in HF10 is mainly (±1/3, ±2/3, z), which agrees with the ABAB stacking sequence predicted by DFT calculations [23]. The relative shifts between layers in HF48 are more randomly distributed. The difference in the stacking sequence further influences the interlayer spacing and bonding between them. For example, the ABAB stacking sequence by definition avoids the possibility that two functional groups are stacked on top of each other; HF10 has a smaller interlayer spacing compared to HF48, which has a random layer stacking shift and (on average) a larger repulsive force between function groups from two adjacent layers. Another possible explanation for the interlayer spacing could be from different levels of water intercalation for the two samples.\nThe HF concentration in the etchant can influence the distribution of surface functional groups and the stacking sequence between adjacent layers. The combined effect of surface functional groups and relative layer shifting controls the interlayer bonding that mainly results from van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. The strength of interlayer hydrogen bonds depends on the functional group types and distributions and orientation of –OH groups relative to the layer. The result provides valuable information on the development of synthesis methods to optimize selected surface terminations, controlled contact angle, and other functional properties."

      "text" : "Recently, our knowledge on the effects of synthesis method on the resultant structure and defects of MXenes have greatly advanced due to the utilization of a combination of characterization methods including XRD, atomic-resolution S/TEM, and neutron diffraction, with support from DFT calculations and MD simulations. Currently, structural details at length scales down to the atomic level can be correlated with the sample preparation method employed. However, there are great challenges before MXenes with desired crystal structures, defect levels, and functional groups can be accurately designed using optimized synthesis methods. This understanding is largely based on empirical data without accurate theoretical predictions. For example, due to the complex chemistries during etching, the concentration of atomic defects and surface functional groups of samples prepared using etchants of different HF concentration still cannot be accurately predicted using thermodynamics and kinetics. The formation mechanism of atomic defects and nanopores is still not clear and requires a more thorough understanding of the etching process, ideally from combined in situ experimental characterization and ab initio calculations. Also, aging and the influence of ambient conditions to the structure should be investigated with more detail [33]. Moreover, it would be very useful to have a clearer understanding at the atomic level of how defects, structure, and functional groups influence various functional properties of MXenes. It is important to extend\n122 X. Sang et al.\nsuch investigations to MXenes beyond Ti3C2Tx, as the MXene family has grown rapidly to include more than 25 different MXenes.

      "text" : "The MXene surfaces are inherently terminated with species that are foreign to the parent MAX phase. First-principle calculations have in numerous investigations shown the preference for termination of the bare MXene surface. The MXenes gain significant negative formation energy upon surface termination, which indicates the formation of strong bonds between the surface M atoms and the terminating species [1, 2]. Accordingly, the MXene chemical formula can be described as Mn+1XnTx, where T stands for surface terminating species and the subscript x indicates the coverage of T on the MXene surface. When x = 2, then for each surface M element atom, one terminating species is attached to the MXene surface.\nThe termination occurs during the very moment that the A layer is etched from the MAX phase. When the bonds originally connecting the MX slabs and the atomically thin A element layer are broken, new bonds are formed with the etchant species. While the etching process is strongly connected to the applied chemicals, the termination process was nicely demonstrated by theoretical means as shown in Fig. 8.1. The simulation shows how the etchant (here HF) interacts with a MAX phase edge (here Ti3AlC2), where particularly the A layer is targeted but additionally interacts with the adjacent M elements. In the process, HF dissociates such that F is attracted by the A and M elements. H is moderately attracted by these elements and prefers to form H2. With increasing HF concentration, the M-A bonds are eventually broken and AlF3 is formed. Hence, the A element is removed from the MAX phase, and the two-dimensional MXene starts to emerge. In the wake of the A element removal, the exposed M element surfaces are terminated by both H and F, though it is shown already in Fig. 8.1c that the preferred configuration is F-terminated surface, while H2 gas emerges as a by-product.\nP. O. Å. Persson ( ) Electron Microscopy of Materials, Thin Film Physics Division, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden e-mail: per.persson@liu.se\n© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 B.

Persson\nThe presence of surface terminating species was identified already in the original MXene report wherein Ti3AlC2 was etched in 50% aqueous HF [3]. It was proposed that the surface terminations originated from the etching process according to the following simplified reactions:\nTi3AlC2 + 3HF = AlF3 + 3/2H2 + Ti3C2 (8.1)\nTi3C2 + 2H2O = Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2 (8.2)\nTi3C2 + 2HF = Ti3C2F2 + H2 (8.3)\nHere, reaction (8.1) is required and is followed by reactions (8.2) and (8.3), in which the emerging MXene is terminated by species from the etchant. Based on a c-parameter obtained from XRD analysis and complementary DFT calculations, the best match was obtained for MXene sheets that were terminated by OH species. Accordingly, reaction (8.2) was deemed most probable, but additional F terminations according to reaction (8.3) could not be ruled out. Hence, the surface terminations were proposed to be OH and/or F. Following research has concluded that the termination chemistry is more complex and that surface terminations may additionally include O [1, 4, 5]. The explanation for the observed surface-bound O was proposed to occur as the surface-bound OH recombine into H2O and O by an equilibrium-driven reaction according to:\nTi3C2(OH)2 = Ti3C2O + H2O (8.4)\n8 MXene Surface Chemistry 127\nParticularly in vacuum, such as in most analytical equipment, the reduced water vapor pressure accelerates the process [6]. The implication of (8.4) is that one site is left with a termination vacancy or termination bare. In a vacuum environment, this can be sustained momentarily, depending on the vacuum conditions, but at ambient conditions the bare surface is likely to be oxidized immediately.\nFor identification and quantification of the terminating species, predominantly X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been implemented [3, 4, 7, 8]. XPS is an excellent tool for such studies since it can be used to determine the surface chemical compositions and the chemical states of the various species. Consequently, XPS enables identification and separation between terminating O and OH, as well as intercalated H2O and, e.g., TiOx particles remaining from the aqueous etching process.\nA complementary method for probing the chemistry and the electronic structure of the surface-bound terminations is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR has been used in the identification of the interactions of the terminating species and found a strong affinity for the OH terminations to bind to water [9]. NMR has also been used in the quantification of terminating species with the conclusion that O and F make up the majority of the terminating species, while OH occupy less than 5% of the available sites [10]. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope ((S)TEM) has been used as a complementary method to identify and quantify O and F [11–13].\nEDX is unable to distinguish between O and OH; hence both are integrated as O. Traditionally, EDX is not well suited to detect light elements which include inherent terminating species. In addition, the EDX signal is highly dependent on the experimental conditions and requires reliable conditions for accurate quantification. EDX on the other hand is highly applicable, e.g., for atomically resolved elemental mapping of the M elements [14].\nComplementary to EDX, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the (S)TEM has been used in quantification but also for site identification and the identification of the functionalizing species. It has been shown that the EELS fine structure is highly sensitive to the terminating species as well as the preferred sites, in both valence EELS and core loss EELS [6, 15–17].\nStructural modeling including surface terminations has been successfully applied using atomic pair distribution functions (PDF) obtained through neutron scattering [13, 18]. Wang et al. used PDF to build a third-generation model of Ti3C2Tx MXene, including the periodicity of the bare MXene sheet and the random distribution of terminating species on the MXene surfaces. Furthermore, PDF experiments have provided significant insight of the inter-layer exchange and potential hydrogen bonds between the terminating species.\nAs a complement to spectroscopic methods, atomic resolution (S)TEM has been employed to observe individual terminating species [6, 17].\nOn the MXene surface, a number of configurations for low-symmetry sites for the terminating species are possible; see Fig. 8.2. Although Fig. 8.2 employs the M3X2 structure to illustrate the potential configurations, the corresponding situation\n128 P. O. Å. Persson\ncan be applied to all Mn+1Xn structures. The configurations include the threefold coordinated Fcc and Hcp sites, as well as the Atop position above a surface M element and the Bridge position between two top surface M elements. All of these sites comprise energetically stable configurations as shown by theoretical means; however, structure optimization typically transforms Bridge and Atop into either Fcc or Hcp during relaxation [1, 19]. In addition to MXenes that are exclusively decorated with terminations in Fcc or Hcp configurations, the MXene theoretically allows for mixed configurations. Indeed, configurations with Hcpcoordinated species on one surface with Fcc-coordinated species on the other have additionally been investigated [20].\nThe most significant difference between the Hcp and Fcc sites comprises the distance to the nearest X element. In the Hcp site, the X element is directly below the terminating species, while for the Fcc site, three X elements are coordinated around the terminating species. The Fcc site has been predicted as the preferred site in numerous studies for both O, OH, and F terminations [1, 16, 20–25]. The reason for the Fcc site being the most favored was proposed to originate as a consequence of steric repulsion between the X element and the terminating species when positioned in the Hcp site [21]. However, some cases have been identified when the terminating species favors the vicinity of the X atom and hence also favors the Hcp site in order to gain more electrons [1, 21, 26, 27]. As a general prediction, the relative stability for each model (Fcc, Hcp, mixed) depends on the possible ionic state of the surface transition metal atoms. If the transition metals can assume an oxidation state that provide sufficient electrons to both the X element and the adsorbed terminating species, the Fcc configuration becomes the most stable. Otherwise, Hcp or mixed emerges as the most stable configuration [1]. The preference for the Fcc site may also be understood from the coordination number of the transition metal ion (M), which is often six. Hence, the surface M elements form octahedral building blocks (M-X3T3) with the underlying X-layer atoms and the terminating species T, with the M atom in the center of the octahedron. It has been observed through PDF analysis that the terminated Ti3C2 MXene shows a distortion in the structure, such that the distance between the surface M element and the underlying X layer is\n8 MXene Surface Chemistry 129\ndifferent compared to the core M element layer and the adjacent X layers [13]. This was verified by a theoretical investigation, which concluded that the surface Ti 3d orbitals interact more strongly with the terminating species (O) 2p orbitals compared to the C 2p orbitals, resulting in a distortion of the octahedron [28].\nAssuming that all Fcc sites are occupied by a termination group, then for each surface M element there is one terminating species. Consequently for Tx where x = 2 indicates saturation of the preferred surface sites. Yet, all other sites are available, such that if both Fcc and Hcp sites would be terminated, then x = 4. Most theoretical investigations assume x = 2, and even experimental investigations justify the elemental ratio between, e.g., O and F, according to this number. However, the occupancy of the MXene surface sites has been investigated, such that the binding energy vs. surface coverage was calculated for single-species systems on Ti2C [2]. It was assumed that the Fcc sites were first occupied; then additional species were placed in Hcp sites such that the surface was supersaturated. The binding energy does not change significantly with increasing occupancy of the Fcc sites, regardless of which species occupies the site. With increasing occupancy of the Hcp site, the binding energy per species increases significantly, though for all species the binding energy is still negative, even for complete saturation of both Fcc and Hcp sites. This however indicates that the system’s surface energy is minimized when all Fcc sites are occupied and Hcp sites are empty. In contrast to the common theoretical investigation, experimental quantifications predominantly report termination coverage with x < 2 [7, 10], but also x > 2 were reported [29]. Storage of MXenes at ambient conditions shows a slow and gradual oxidation that starts at the F-terminated sites, transforming the MXenes into metal oxyfluorides and causing a decrease in the amount of F terminations while increasing the number of O terminations on the MXene [7]. Particularly for systems that are oxidized to the point of ammorphization display x 2. Given the present experimental understanding, the level of saturation of the MXene surfaces by terminating species is not understood, and experiments with tailored surface composition are called for. Vice versa, while experimental investigations identify a mix of terminating species, only a few theoretical investigations have addressed the emerging properties from mixed terminations [30, 31].\nThe relative stability of the O, OH, and F (as well as H) terminating species has been addressed from both theoretical and experimental considerations. Based on Bader charge analysis and thermodynamic stability analysis, it was concluded that for Fcc site-saturated MXene surfaces, such that x = 2, the order of stability goes as Ti3C2O2 > Ti3C2F2 > Ti3C2OH2 > Ti3C2H2 [2, 28].\nA recent temperature-programmed investigation combining (S)TEM and XPS identified the MXene surface as highly dynamical, as shown by the XPS results in Fig. 8.3. The XPS investigation revealed that F occupies only one site at any applied temperature throughout the experiment. However, O moves about on the surface, which can be seen as a reorganization of the O signal with temperature. At temperatures above 600 ◦C, F starts to desorb, and in the wake, O moves to occupy the abandoned site. This preferred site was identified by atomically resolved (S)TEM imaging as the Fcc site [29]. In the complementary TEM investigation,\n130 P. O. Å. Persson\na few-layer Ti3C2Tx particle exhibited a clearly hexagonal appearance originating from the M3X2 structure, as expected, with the addition of a significantly disordered structure superimposed on the ordered Ti3C2. Upon heating the multilayer particle in vacuum, the disordered appearance was removed in favor of an ordered appearance in conjunction with the desorption of F from the MXene surface.\nThe experiment nicely describes a range of fundamentals; the preferred site for a functionalizing species is the theoretically predicted Fcc site. Furthermore, among the mixed terminations, F is the element that insists on occupying the preferred site over O. According to the increased water vapor pressure for vacuum conditions and at elevated temperatures, any OH contribution to the O signal was estimated as negligible. Also, little or no reduction of the O signal was observed during heating. Consequently, the surface-bound O displays a configuration with two alternative sites initially (with some redistribution with temperature) as identified by the O 1s signal. The experiment further identifies O to be the most stable terminating species, since it prevails as F desorbs. The preference for F to occupy the FCC site over O was suggested to occur as a consequence of the higher electronegativity. Finally, the experiment indicates that heating is a viable process route to deplete the MXene surfaces from F.\nThe disordered appearance, together with the two identified alternative sites for O, indicates that the position of O terminations on the surface is not necessarily well defined prior to F desorption. Indeed, diffusion of O on a Ti2C surface was investigated by theoretical means [19]. While diffusing from one Fcc site to the\n8 MXene Surface Chemistry 131\nnext, an initial barrier of 0.53 eV has to be overcome in order to pass a Bridge site and into a Hcp site. However, from the Hcp site, crossing a Bridge and into the Fcc site, the barrier is approximately half (0.26 eV). With such negligible barriers, the diffusion between Hcp and Bridge sites is nearly barrierless. Also, during the diffusion process, the charge state of an O termination (again assuming x = 2) hardly changes from either sites (Fcc, −1.465 |e|; Bridge, −1.416 |e|; Hcp, −1.492 |e|). However, these conditions assume that the surface is exclusively terminated by O.\nThe dynamical properties of the terminations was observed by low-kV (S)TEM at ambient temperature on single- and double-sheet Ti3C2Tx MXene as shown in Fig. 8.4 [6]. The low-kV method promotes contrast from surface terminating species on 2D materials as shown here. From Fig. 8.4 it can be seen that the terminating species are organized in clusters that move about on the MXene surface. Using EELS, little or no F was observed on these sheets due to extended storage at ambient conditions; however, the clusters were identified as O-rich. Although some heating is applied to the MXene as a consequence of the interaction with the electron beam, the migration occurs already at low temperatures and underscores the facile migration of O surface terminations. From Fig. 8.4, it can also be observed that the O terminations are strongly attracted to single Ti adatoms that are scattered about the surface. The Ti adatoms presumably originate from defects in the MXene structure [6, 17]. Also the Ti adatoms are seen to organize themselves in clusters that\n132 P. O. Å. Persson\nattract a cloud of O terminations at ambient temperatures. At higher temperatures, interstitials have been observed to organize themselves into additional MX layers on Ti3C2Tx, during in situ heating and local e-beam heating in the STEM [32].\nSuch localized TiOx structures presumably destabilize the MXene. To verify this, a recent investigation into Nb2CTx was published, where the MXene was prepared such that >2/3 of the surface area was covered by adatoms immediately after etching (more than two adatoms per three M atoms); see Fig. 8.5b [33]. Though the immediate structure was highly organized, storage under high vacuum conditions initially depleted the surface from adatoms that were presumed to agglomerate and locally form NbOx clusters together with the migrating O terminations. These clusters served to locally destabilize and amorphize the MXene structure, leaving the adjacent MXene structure free from adatoms as shown in Fig. 8.5c. Upon exposure to ambient conditions, the structure was almost entirely amorphized as shown in Fig. 8.5d. These observations together identify O terminations as particularly attracted by surface adatoms and that the formed clusters become a nucleating point for degradation of the MXene structure.\nPresently, MXenes exhibit a mix of terminations that is somewhat controlled. In order to correlate the MXene properties with the terminating species, it is essential to find means of tailoring the surface terminations. Additionally, to find unprecedented properties and new applications for MXenes, the inherent mix of terminations must be replaced with entirely new species. Accordingly, there has been some interest in tailoring the relative composition of the surface terminating species [9, 10, 15, 18, 28]. It is clear that the etchant constitutes the first and simplest choice toward tailored termination. Reducing the HF concentration during etching results in MXenes terminated by a reduced number of F terminations and a larger O/F ratio. NMR has also been used to investigate differences in terminations while changing the etchant. It was found that HF-synthesized MXenes contained approximately four times more F terminations compared to MXenes synthesized by a combination of LiF and HCl [10]. Further tailoring of the terminating species can also be achieved using post etching treatments such as by K+ ion intercalation. Using potassium hydroxide and potassium acetate in aqueous solutions, it was shown that the relative F termination content is reduced significantly as Ti-F bonds were suggested to become unstable at high pH [34]. A facile method for entirely avoiding terminations by F, and promoting O-containing species, is by alternatives to HF or LiF etching. A recent investigation employed a hydrothermal process to etch Ti3AlC2 at 270 ◦C in a 27.5 m NaOH solution. The results showed the removal of Al from Ti3AlC2 yielding only OH- and O-terminated multilayer Ti3C2Tx with a yield of 92 wt% [35].\nWhile showing promise for tuning the terminating species and hence the MXene properties, available terminating species remain limited to those inherent to the etchant. Enyashin et al. proposed the replacement of the aqueous solution for alcohol or aqueous-alcohol solution and showed using density-functional tightbinding (DFTB), DFT, and MD calculations that methoxy-terminated MXenes can be stable. These findings suggest MXenes for catalytic applications such as in esterification processes [36].\n8 MXene Surface Chemistry 133\nAnother approach for termination manipulation and for achieving terminations that are not inherent to the etchant is through a reduction process following the etching procedure. For example, removal of F terminations using a high-temperature vacuum annealing process has been investigated in a number of publications, such as shown in Fig. 8.3. However, temperatures exceeding ~750 ◦C typically initiate a phase transformation, where the 2D sheets transform into a 3D structure [29, 37].\nHaving removed F (and OH) at high temperatures and at high vacuum conditions, only O remains on the surface. Depending on the original coverage, some sites become available to new terminations that can be introduced, e.g., through gas\n134 P. O. Å. Persson\nphase. This allows, e.g., complete saturation of the MXene surfaces by O or introduction and adsorption of new species.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, a number of new terminations have been investigated, including N- and Cl-functionalized MXenes [38, 39]. By investigating N-terminated Nb2C and Ta2C by first-principle calculations, Shao et al. found that these MXenes are not only stable but that they additionally exhibit direct bandgap semiconducting properties and ultrahigh carrier mobility equaling or exceeding that of graphene. Wang et al. also used a first-principle approach to investigate the electrochemical storage mechanism of Cl− ions onto MXenes. It was observed that Cl ion diffusion requires a much lower kinetic barrier for diffusion on the 2D surface than for the barrier connected to diffusion in bulk materials. This was expected to lead to a large reversible Cl capacity and high-rate capability.\nWhile MXenes have been primarily investigated for applications in electrochemistry and for electronics, recently a number of theoretical works have investigated these materials for their properties in carbon capture, storage, and conversion [40, 41]. Morales-Garcia and Li have shown independently that the bare MXene surface can easily accommodate the CO2 molecule. Given the large surface area of MXenes, reaching 250–1000 m2 g−1, these materials can accommodate 2.34(W2C) -8.25(Ti2C) mol CO2 kg−1. These numbers are highly competitive to existing solutions for carbon capture, e.g., the zeolite I3X accommodates 3.96 mol CO2 kg−1.\nLi further showed that the MXenes can catalyze a conversion of the captured CO2 to CH4 with a modest input of energy.\nIn summary, MXene surface terminations play an important role in the stability of the MXene structure and for the emerging properties. Currently, little is understood about the occupancy and on the dynamics of the terminations. It is clear that the terminations can be somewhat manipulated through the design of etching protocols and through post-processing. However, complete control is still lacking, and the currently measured termination composition may equally well depend on the preparation process as well as the interactions with ambient atmosphere as well as the experimental setup. The current research front is required to develop toward complete control of the surface terminations in order to tailor properties for specific applications, such as termination by non-inherent species."

      "text" : "In recent years two-dimensional materials have attracted tremendous attention due to their superior electronic, mechanical, chemical, and optical properties. MXene structures, which are among the latest additions to the 2-D materials, have been extensively studied because of their diverse applications from energy storage including electrode materials, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors to water purification and catalysis [1]. Computational methods are powerful and useful techniques for developing and optimizing novel materials. Among different computational methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide efficient, deep, detailed, and realistic understanding of physical and chemical basis of different materials and systems. MD solves the classical Newton’s equations of motion for the interacting many-particle system [2]. MD can be categorized into three different groups ab initio, reactive, and non-reactive empirical force fields. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods use direct quantum calculations for calculating the forces between the particles in each MD iteration, while empirical force field-based methods (non-reactive and reactive) use a predefined mathematical expression (force field) to calculate the forces. The parameters of the force field are usually obtained from fitting to the quantum calculations or the experimental data.\nRoghayyeh Lotfi and Dundar E.

Lotfi et al.\nAIMD methods are typically more precise than empirical MD methods, but the computational cost of AIMD is much higher. On the other hand, non-reactive MD methods are limited to the systems without explicit chemical reactions, but their computational cost is much lower than AIMD. Reactive MD methods use the bond order concept in force fields to simulate the systems with chemical reactions, and their computational cost is between AIMD and non-reactive MD methods. All three categories of MD techniques have been used for simulating the MXene structures based on the complexity and the desired time scale of the simulations. Here, we have briefly introduced the MD simulation technique with ab initio, reactive, and nonreactive empirical force fields. Then we have reviewed the simulation of MXene structures with MD simulations in different applications such as energy storage and adsorption of ions and molecules, catalysis, exfoliation, and water purification."

      "text" : "MD simulations predict the time evolution of a system with interacting particles. The basic principle of any kind of simulation is to model the environment of the subject and calculate the observables based on the model. For atomistic simulations, the subject is ensemble of atoms and the environment is the interaction between them. The observables are calculated via modeling forces between particles and calculating the positions and velocities of them at each iteration of the simulation. One of the simplest models is Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential:\nE = 4 [( σ\nrij\n)12 − ( σ\nrij\n)6] for rij < rc (9.1)\nForce between atoms i and j can be calculated by applying the gradient operator:\nFij = −∇Eij (9.2)\nCalculating acceleration of atoms in the next iteration is straightforward with Newton’s second law:\nmia = N∑\nj =i Fij (9.3)\nPositions and velocities could be integrated with so-called leapfrog method:\nr (t + t) = r(t) + tv (\nt + t 2\n) (9.4)\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 139\nHere t is the time step of the simulation. The continuous motion of atoms is approximated as discrete jumps in the time domain. Size of these jumps is often called MD time step. Observables of the system can be measured using velocities or positions of atoms.\nApart from errors caused by modeling the continuous motion as discrete jumps in Eq. 9.4, the total energy of the system (E) is conserved. Thus, the ensemble of such a system is the microcanonical, in which total energy, number of atoms, and volume (N, V, E) are conserved. Observables such as temperature and pressure should be controlled in order to simulate the system under the desired conditions. Controlling the pressure of the system can be achieved by simply adjusting the volume of the simulation box. The temperature of the system can be controlled by adding an external system as a heat bath to mimic the surrounding of a real system. This interaction can be modeled by scaling the velocities of particles. The basis of scaling is the fact that when an atom or particle collides with another particle, the result of this collision is a change in the velocity of the particle, v∗ = sv. The kinetic energy term regarding to the scaling factor s is introduced to construct the dynamical equation for s. The equations of motions for this extended system become:\nma = − 1 s2 ∇E − 2ṡ s v (9.5)\nThus, the temperature of the system can be controlled with scaling velocities of atoms in the system. In such a system temperature is constant along with number of particles and volume (N, V, T) as a canonical ensemble. This method first proposed by Nose in 1984 [3] and extended a year later by Hoover [4] and often called Nose– Hoover thermostat. Some other thermostats such as Berendsen [5] and Andersen [6] have also been developed."

      "heading" : "The Empirical Force Fields and Bond Order Concept in Molecular Dynamics Simulations",
      "text" : "Atomistic simulations utilize “force field” to determine the interatomic potentials and calculate the system energy. A force field is a set of mathematical expressions to relate the energy of a system to the coordinates of its atoms. It consists of functional forms of interatomic potential energies and a set of parameters. The parameters are usually obtained by fitting to the quantum chemistry calculations or the experimental data. The first force fields appeared in 1966 by Keating [7], who modeled the diamond structure using a bond stretching and bond angle term. Since then the goal of research in this area has changed to develop force fields applicable form more complicated systems. Good examples are MM, Dreiding, Universal (UFF), CHARMM, AMBER, GROMOS, OPLS, and COMPASS. More\n140 R. Lotfi et al.\ndetails about empirical force fields can be found in Ref. [8]. A typical expression for a force field includes the following terms for energy description:\nEsystem = Ebond + Eangle + Etorsion + EvdWaals + ECoulomb\n= kb(b − b0)2 + kv(θ − θ0)2 + Vn [1 + cos (nω − δ)] + 4εij [( σij rij )12 − (σijrij )6] + C qijrij\n(9.6)\nwhere the first three terms are related to the intramolecular interactions in the total energy (including bond stretching, angle bending, and dihedral torsion), and the last two terms are related to the intermolecular contribution in the total energy (van der Waals interactions, in this case a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential, and the Coulombic interactions). In this equation, the terms which describe the geometry of the structure include the bond length, b, the valence angle, θ, the dihedral or torsion angle, ω, and the distance between atoms i and j, rij. The parameters include the bond force constant and equilibrium distance, kb and b0, respectively; the valence angle force constant and equilibrium angle, kv, and θ0; the dihedral angle force constant, multiplicity, and phase angle, Vn, n, and δ, the partial atomic charges, qi, the LJ well-depth, εij, minimum interaction radius, σij, and Coulomb’s constant, C [8].\nHowever, such force fields are not sufficient to consider the changes in the connectivity of atoms during the bond breaking and formation, especially in chemical reactions. Thus, it is necessary to compute the bonds based on local geometry instead of having pre-defined bonds. This motivates the use of some terms in the force-field description, which are related to the connectivity of the atoms, leading to a reactive force field. Reactive force fields can be categorized into two groups. The first group is based on electron density such as the Finnis–Sinclair, embedded-atom method (EAM), modified EAM (MEAM), and Stillinger–Weber (SW). The second group is based on the integrated bond order terms such as Abell, Chelikowsky, Tersoff, REBO, COMB, and ReaxFF. More detailed information about reactive force fields can be found in the review paper [9]. To the best of our knowledge, simulation of MXene structures with reactive force fields has only been implemented with ReaxFF force field. Thus, ReaxFF technique has been introduced with more details in the next section."

      "heading" : "ReaxFF Force Fields",
      "text" : "ReaxFF is a bond order based reactive force field formalism which allows bond formation and bond breaking during molecular dynamics simulation [10, 11]. Bond order is empirically calculated from interatomic distances between all pairs of atoms and it is updated at each step. Consequently, a smooth transition between the non-bonded states and single, double, or triple bonded states would be possible. This approach leads to the simulation of chemical reactions with a comparable\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 141\naccuracy to quantum calculations but with much lower computational cost. Unlike in traditional force fields, in ReaxFF, each element is described by only one single atom type and the reaction site or connectivity information is not needed beforehand. Such transferability allows proper migration of atoms between phases during the molecular dynamics simulation. Bond order is calculated directly from interatomic distance using the empirical formula:\nBOij = BOσij + BOπij + BOππij\n= exp [ pbo1 ( rij\nrσ0\n)pbo2] + exp [ pbo3 ( rij\nrπ0\n)pbo4] + exp [ pbo5 ( rij\nrππ0\n)pbo6] (9.7)\nwhere BO is the bond order, rij is the distance between atoms i and j, and rO and pbo terms are equilibrium bond lengths and empirical parameters, respectively. This equation is continuous by transitions between σ , π , and ππ bonds, leading to a differentiable potential energy surface for calculating the interatomic forces. The total interaction energy in ReaxFF is described by the following energy contributions:\nEsystem = Ebond + Eover + Eunder + Etor + Eval + Elp + Evdw + Ecoulombic (9.8)\nThe total energy of the system (Esystem) consists of bonded or covalent interactions (which are bond order dependent) and non-bonded interactions. Bond order-dependent terms include bond energy (Ebond), over-coordination (Eover), and under-coordination (Eunder). Energy penalty terms include torsion-angle energy (Etor), valance-angle energy (Eval), and lone pair energy (Elp). Non-bonded interactions include van der Waals (Evdw) and Coloumb energy (Ecoulomb). All connectivity energy terms, such as valance-angle and torsion-angle, are bond order dependent. In addition, non-bonded interactions such as van der Waals and Coulomb terms are taken into account for the entire system between each pair of atoms. Atomic charges are derived from an electronegativity equalization method (EEM) [12]. It should be noted that despite the previous bond order based reactive force fields (such as Tersoff and Brenner), a dynamic charge method is used in ReaxFF which changes the charge on the atoms based on their chemical environment. Furthermore, in comparison to the previous reactive potentials, a longer-ranged bond order is used in ReaxFF, leading to more precise transition states and reaction kinetics.\nAb Initio MD\nThe Latin term ab initio which means “from the beginning” is used to describe the essence of quantum chemistry calculations which leads to understanding the\n142 R. Lotfi et al.\nmaterial by solving Schrodinger’s equation of the system. Born–Oppenheimer approximation states that atomic nuclei and electronic part of the wave function can be separated. Following this, a point at potential energy surface is the minimum of the energy functional with respect to electronic wave function ψ i(r, t):\nE (ψi, RI , αv) = ∑\ni\n∫ d3rψ∗i (r) [ − 2\n2m ∇2\n] ψi(r) + V [n(r), RI , αv.] (9.9)\nIn general, solving this equation involves expanding the electronic wave function as a sum of orthogonal wave functions and transforming Eq. 9.10 to a set of linear equations. Solving this set requires matrix diagonalization which grows rapidly with size of the system. Car and Parrinello considered parameters in Eq. 9.9 as timedependent and introduced the Lagrangian of such a system [13]:\nL = ∑\ni\n1 2 μ\n∫\nd3r ∣∣ψ̇i∣∣2 + ∑\nI\n1 2 MIṘ 2 I + ∑ v 1 2 μvα̇ 2 v − E [ψi, RI , αv] (9.10)\nEquations of motion can be derived from the Lagrangian of the system. The temperature of the system can be slowly reduced by varying the velocities in Eq. 9.10 until the equilibrium state of minimum energy is reached. At equilibrium, the second derivative of electronic wave functions is zero and Eq. 9.10 is reduced to Eq. 9.9 within a unitary transformation. Thus, with these conditions satisfied, the Lagrangian accurately describes a physical system whose representative point lies on BO potential surface. This approach greatly reduces the computation for large systems with respect to solving Kohn–Sham equations directly. Comparing physical masses of ions and electrons in the system, kinetic energy of electrons is safely ignored. Thus, electrons are assumed to be at their ground state while ions move under forces. Later, Bloch, and Parrinello improved the approach which unifies the molecular dynamics and quantum calculations by implementing Nose’s thermostat to accurately control the temperature of the system throughout the dynamical simulation. More details can be found in Refs. [13, 14]."

      "heading" : "Modeling MXenes with Classical Non-reactive Force Fields",
      "text" : "Many structural and thermodynamic aspects of MXenes and their interactions with solvents and electrolytes have been studied using simple non-reactive force fields. Despite their limitation to the investigation of processes without explicit chemical reactions, these models offer high computational efficiency for the simulations of large-scale systems and slow dynamics of electrode charging. Moreover, they are often optimized for a given set of thermodynamic conditions and may therefore reproduce specific properties more accurately than more general models. Although only a few models have been developed specifically for MXenes, a large variety of\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 143\nforce fields are readily available from literature for most common fluid compounds. However, combining force fields from different sources and optimizing separately for the solid and fluid phases must be done with care and, ideally, be validated by comparison with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The atomic interactions are typically defined through a combination of the non-bonded LennardJones (LJ) potential with point charge electrostatics, along with harmonic bonded terms such as in the popular force field sets of OPLS or UFF. For pure solids, simple many-body embedded atom models (EAMs) have been applied. Their availability along with computational efficiency makes simple force fields an ideal tool for the exploration of the configurational space, interpretation of scattering experiments, and testing hypotheses about possible interfacial and confined microstructures. Such exploratory simulations can be then followed by more expensive quantumchemical calculations to include more realistic description of electronic properties and chemical reactions.\nAtomistic simulations have provided the first insights into the mechanical properties of individual MXene sheets, whose micrometer size poses a significant challenge for their direct experimental study. In the absence of existing optimized force fields for MXenes, Borysiuk et al. combined the EAM potential for Ti-Ti interactions with two- and three-body terms for Ti–C and C–C interactions to study a selected titanium carbide (Tin+1Cn) sheets [15, 16]. In close agreement with previously published DFT data [17], their investigation of Ti2C under tensile loading yielded Young’s modulus of ~1 TPa, which is about 50% lower than for graphene but three times higher than for MoS2. The simulations also indicate different modes of failure and fracturing as a function of the number of atomic layers [15]. The follow-up study of bending rigidity predicted the effective spring constant for Ti2C to be larger than for graphene but lower than MoS2, [16] while the bending rigidity of multilayer sheets Ti3C2 and Ti4C3 was higher than the other two single-layer materials.\nCharging and discharging dynamics of [EMIM]+[PF6]− in Ti3C2(OH)2 MXene pores has been studied by Xu et al. using MD simulations [18]. In their setup, the positive and negative electrodes were represented by rigid immovable MXene plates situated in the same simulation box, and were gradually charged and discharged by scaling atomic charges during the course of the simulation. The authors observed that in the first stage of the charging process counter-ions compensating the electrode charge enter the pore and then, with a delay, co-ions leave the pore. The resulting fluctuations in the total number of ions confined in the slit pores during the charge–discharge cycles suggested that a volumetric response of the electrodes should be observed for a more realistic representation of the system with mobile MXene plates. In a follow-up study, Xu et al. investigated changes in interlayer spacing as a response to the positive and negative charging of Ti3C2T2 (T=O, OH, F) MXene in [EMIM]+[TFSI]− [19] with OPLS force field and MXene plates represented as rigid but movable bodies. In agreement with the trends observed in combined electrochemical and X-ray diffraction experiments [20, 21], they found volume expansion for negative polarization and contraction for positive polarization. At the atomic scale, the expansion was seen as the result of the cation intercalation,\nwhereas the contraction was mostly the result of ion exchange and, to smaller extent, cation de-intercalation.\nThe response of ion-intercalated MXenes to water has been investigated in a study combining scattering, electrochemical, and gravimetric experiments with classical and quantum chemical simulations [22]. The atomistic simulations have been used to identify the driving forces behind volumetric changes measured during hydration and dehydration cycles, such as the strong hysteresis of this process or large interlayer separations of Mg2+-intercalated MXenes at low hydration levels. The classical simulations suggested that in the confined environment the compact Mg(H2O)6 clusters can act as pillars with voids in-between (Fig. 9.1). In contrast, the weaker bonds between monovalent K+ ions and water molecules do not allow the formation of similarly stable clusters, which leads to smaller interlayer separations for K+-intercalated MXenes. However, since strong electrostatic forces exerted by the ionic charges will significantly polarize the conducting MXene plates, the simple force field cannot be expected to provide accurate answers about the strength of the interfacial interactions and assess reliably the metastability of the structures. To reduce this uncertainty, the structures generated in the classical simulations were used as input into DFT simulations, which confirmed that Mg(H2O)6 clusters are stable enough to.\nMXenes have also been suggested as prospective molecular sieving membranes and studied by Ding et al. using MD simulations [23]. The authors calculated the flux and diffusion of small gas particles (H2, He, N2, O2, CO2, and CH4) through MXene with two different terminations, Ti3C2O2 and Ti3C2O2 and a constant pore gap of 3.5 Å. To capture the different response of MXene to the strong quadrupole moment of CO2 molecules the interactions of MXene atoms were described by a combination of the UFF force field with QEq charge equilibration [24, 25]. While they observed no significant effect of the surface termination on gas permeation, the simulations predicted large differences between the mobility of different gasses. In particular, gas particles with sizes smaller than the pore width (H2 He) diffused approximately 100 times faster than the remaining larger molecules. Even though no experiments measuring dynamics were performed to validate the model and its predictions, the good agreement between the simulated\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 145\nand experimental selectivities, including the high selectivity for CO2/H2 mixtures, attributed to the specific CO2 interactions, suggests that the simulations likely capture the correct trends in the dynamics as well."

      "heading" : "Modeling MXenes with Reactive ReaxFF Force Field",
      "text" : "As mentioned earlier, reactive molecular dynamics can model the chemical reactions and interactions during the simulation. Among them, ReaxFF has the advantage of predicting the transition states and reaction kinetics more precisely in comparison to other reactive force fields. MD simulations with ReaxFF have been used for studying the ion intercalation and water diffusion in MXene sheets as well as measuring the friction coefficient of these structures.\nDue to hydrophilic nature of MXene surfaces and weak attraction between the layers, water molecules can intercalate in MXene structure easily. Osti et al. used X-ray and neutron scattering techniques to show that presence of potassium cations enhances the homogeneity and water stability in MXenes [26]. They also used ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations, and they found that similar to the experiment, presence of potassium ions decreases the self-diffusion of water molecules and increases the stability of hydrated MXene. To consider the interaction of Ti3C2Tx layers intercalated with pure water and metal ions, they developed a new ReaxFF description from previously developed potentials for water and cations and for Ti/O/H interaction by adding new DFT data for Ti-C bond, C-Ti-C/O angles and the energy of condensed phases. To intercalate water molecules and metal ions in the interlayer spacing of MXene layers, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation was carried out. During the MC simulations, water molecules had the capability to be randomly added into the system, removed, or moved. After each 20 successful GCMC iterations, subsequent MD simulation was performed for 10 ps under isobaric–isothermal condition (NPT) at 300 K and 0.1 MPa. The results indicated that the intercalated potassium ions decrease the diffusion coefficient of water in the ion-intercalated MXene by two orders of magnitude in comparison to the pristine MXene (Fig. 9.2). The reduction in water diffusion coefficient due to ion-induced effect indicates a higher stability of hydrated MXene.\nIn another work, Osti et al. studied the effects of intercalated metal ions (lithium, sodium, or potassium ions) on the vibrational states of water confined in Ti3C2Tx MXene structures using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and MD simulations [27]. Such study is important for understanding the behavior of MXenes in different applications such as aqueous electrolytes and water purification. Using INS, the authors observed that water in pristine MXene is more disordered, while it is more ordered in intercalated MXene. They confirmed this result with ReaxFF MD simulation for a system of 1776 atoms at 300 K. The results indicated that by increase in ion size, the mobility of water molecules decreases. As shown in Fig. 9.3, Li+ ions position themselves between the MXene surface and water layers, while K+ (and almost Na+) ions sit along the water layer. Moreover, the results\n146 R. Lotfi et al.\nrevealed that the order of diffusion coefficient of water in intercalated MXene is as following: Li+ > Na+ > K+ and all of these coefficients are about two orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk water. This means that the interference of Li+ ions with water molecules is lower than Na+ and K+ ions. Thus, the water molecules in the presence of Li+ ions are more disordered, whereas Na+ and K+ ions make the water molecules more ordered through higher resistance to the water motion. The radial distribution function (RDF) for water also confirmed that the order parameter of the water molecules is as following: Li+ < Na+ < K+.\nSelective ion intercalation between MXene layers has the potential in development of charge selective membranes for water treatment applications. Thus, dynamical response of MXenes to intercalation of ions is crucial. Berdiyorov and Mahmoud used DFT, AIMD, and ReaxFF to investigate the effect of surface termination on the dynamical response of bilayer MXenes to intercalation of different ions (Fig. 9.4) [28]. They observed an increase and a decrease in the interlayer distance with intercalation of anions and cations, respectively. It decreased further with increasing charge of the cations by adding extra electrons to the MXene\nlayers. They conducted ReaxFF MD simulations using published parameters for Ti3C2(OH)2 MXene systems [26]. In this case, the system consists of bilayer MXene with 144 atoms and 14 water molecules. The temperature of the system was increased from 0 to 300 K with a rate of 3 K/ps with NPT ensemble. The simulation continued for 1 ns at 300 K with NVT ensemble. In the presence of water molecules, the distance between MXene layers averaged 7.62 Å without any ions. Adding two K+ ions between layers decreased the interlayer distance to 7.57 Å. This dynamic response originates from the charged nature of the material. These simulations confirmed selective intercalation of MXenes which is important for designing the membranes based on MXenes for water treatment applications.\nDue to low friction coefficients between layers of similar two-dimensional materials, it is expected that Ti3C2 MXenes also have low friction coefficients. Zhang et al. calculated friction coefficients of Tin+1Cn MXenes (n = 1, 2, and 3) with and without surface termination, using DFT and ReaxFF MD simulations [29]. Stacking energies of multilayer structures were calculated. There are three highsymmetry stacking sequences for all three cases: the one with bottom oxygen atoms of the upper layer is at face-centered cubic positions with respect to bottom layer (Fig. 9.5c S1), one with the bottom oxygen atoms of the upper layer sits at the hexagonal close-packed positions of the bottom layer (Fig. 9.5d S2), and finally one with bottom oxygen atoms of the upper layer is at the top of oxygen atoms of bottom layer (Fig. 9.5e S3). The energetics of these stacking sequences sampled with DFT calculations by gradually shifting the top layer, while bottom layer was fixed.\nFor all cases, S1 is the minimum energy configuration for the stacking of layers. Type S2 is the local minima with slightly higher potential energy. The S3\n148 R. Lotfi et al.\nsequences are local maxima in the potential energy surfaces due to repulsive forces between oxygen atoms of top and bottom layers. To investigate the sliding of larger Tin+1CnO2 MXene (for n = 1, 2, and 3) bilayer systems, Zhang et al. carried out the MD simulations with ReaxFF potentials [29]. These systems contained 40,000– 70,000 atoms with simulation cell dimensions of 19 × 18 × 3 nm. Figure compares the energy change during the sliding calculated with DFT (Fig. 9.6a) and ReaxFF (Fig. 9.6b). ReaxFF calculations produced the same trend, albeit higher energies at S2.\nBased on DFT and ReaxFF simulations, average friction coefficients were calculated between 0.24 and 0.26 for normal pressures below 1.2 GPa. They also considered the effect of Ti vacancies at the sublayer and terminal O vacancies at the surface in ReaxFF simulations. These defects increased the roughness of the structure and consequently the friction coefficient."

      "text" : "Ab initio molecular dynamics can be named as the most precise and the most computationally expensive MD technique. In each MD iteration, the interatomic forces are calculated using electronic structure-based quantum techniques. AIMD method has been used in studying MXene structures in two different categories.\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 149\nIn the first category, AIMD is used directly for finding the final structure and calculating some properties of the system. For example, adsorption of H2 molecules, uranyl, and Li and Na ions on MXene structure and exfoliation of MAX phases to MXene have been studied by this category of AIMD. Second group of AIMD simulations on MXene structures has used AIMD to confirm the stability of the system at finite temperatures. Some studies on MXenes such as adsorption of heavy metals, magnetic and metallic properties, Li intercalation, and photocatalytic water splitting have used AIMD to check the stability of the system at a specified temperature.\nHu et al. used DFT to find the hydrogen storage properties of the twodimensional (2D) Ti2C MXene [30]. They showed that depending on different adsorption sites, the hydrogen can be stored by three modes: chemisorption, physisorption, and Kubas-type. The authors used AIMD simulations to verify that the hydrogen molecules bonded by Kubas-type can be desorbed reversibly under ambient conditions. The simulations were performed at 300 and 400 K for 1.5 ps with a time step of 1.0 fs. The results indicated that at both temperatures of 300 and 400 K, all of physisorbed H2 molecules desorb from the surfaces, while all chemisorbed H2 molecules stay at the initial sites. H2 molecules bonded by Kubastype interaction revealed different behaviors at 300 and 400 K. At 300 K, only three H2 molecules departed, while at 400 K, almost half of the H2 molecules by Kubas-type interaction released from the surface (during the short simulation time of 1.5 ps). Thus, the AIMD simulations confirmed that Ti2C MXene structure is a reversible hydrogen storage material in the temperature range 300–400 K.\nIn a similar work, Hu et al. investigated the hydrogen storage capacity of 2D Sc2C MXene structure [31] and showed that similar to Ti2C MXene, three types of interaction including chemisorption, physisorption, and Kubas-type are observed\nfor hydrogen storage in Sc2C. To study the desorption behavior of hydrogen from Sc2C surface AIMD was performed at 273 and 400 K for 1.5 ps with a time step of 1.0 fs (Fig. 9.7). At temperature of 273 and 400 K, all the chemisorbed H atoms stay at the initial sites and all the H2 molecules stored by physisorption desorb from the surfaces. The Kubas type H2 molecules remained on their sites at 273 K, while almost all of them were released from the surface at 400 K. They concluded that Sc2C is a suitable reversible hydrogen storage media under ambient conditions.\nZhang et al. used DFT simulations to study the adsorption of uranyl ions on hydroxylated MXene Ti3C2(OH)2 in aqueous environments [32]. In order to investigate the solvated effect on the configuration of adsorbed uranyl on MXene structure, they performed AIMD simulations based on finite-temperature density functional theory (FT-DFT) at temperature of 298.5 K for 10 ps with time steps of 1.0 fs. The water molecules were added randomly to the optimized adsorption configuration. The pair correlation functions were obtained by averaging over the last 5-ps simulation (Fig. 9.8). The results indicated the aqua solution does not influence the configurations of water ligands of uranyl, verifying that the model without aqua solution used for the adsorption of uranyl on hydroxylated MXene is reliable.\nIn a similar work, Zhang et al. used DFT-based electronic structure simulations to study the adsorption of uranyl ions on hydroxylated V2C MXene structure [33]. They used AIMD simulations within the NVT canonical ensemble to find the stable surface morphology of hydroxylated V2C surfaces. The Nose–Hoover thermostat\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 151\nwas used at T = 298 K for a run time of 10 ps with time steps of 1.0 fs. They added 56 H2O molecules on both sides of the V2C MXene to reach a density close to the real density of aqueous water (1 g/cm3). Figure 9.9 shows the AIMD snapshots of V2C MXene structure in water solution at 0, 1, and 8 ps. The results indicated that OH functional groups are located on top of the hollow sites between three neighboring C atoms. Moreover, the surface structures at 1 and 8 ps are almost similar, indicating that the surfaces of V2C MXene structure are covered rapidly with OH functional groups.\nChemical exfoliation of MAX phases to MXene layers often involves intercalation of reactants between layers. Sirvastava et al. used DFT calculations for\n152 R. Lotfi et al.\nunderstanding the exfoliation of MXene from bulk phase via HF solution [34]. In order to investigate the effects of HF concentration and temperature on the exfoliation process, AIMD simulations were performed at 300 K with a time step of 1 fs and the plane wave basis set cutoff of 350 eV at different concentrations of HF 1–18% (Fig. 9.10). At low concentration of HF, the F atom binds with Al and with concentration increase, AlF3 and H2 are formed (AlF3 by dark orange and cyan colors, and H2 by dark pink color). Moreover, the results indicated that higher temperature enhances the reaction rate.\nIn a similar work, the transformation of Nb4AlC3 MAX structure to Nb4C3 MXene was studied using AIMD method by Mishra et al. [35]. It has been showed that Nb-C bond is stronger than the Nb-Al bond [36]. This enables the insertion of guest atoms between the layers and breaking the Al bonds. Mishra et al. used AIMD technique to show chemical transformation of Nb4AlC3 MAX structure to Nb4C3 MXene by inserting Li atoms as guest atoms. The supercell contains 17 atoms (8 Nb, 6 C, Li, Al, F atoms). MD time step set to 1 fs. After increasing the temperature to 500 K the bonds started to dissociate at 200 fs of the simulation. This leads to the isolation of one pristine layer of MXene from the MAX phase. Snapshots from the simulation display the isolation process (Fig. 9.11).\nThey also increased the supercell to 3 × 1 × 1 to support the conclusion. In this case, Nb Li bond increased by 20% at 500 K in 20 ps. Later, temperature was increased to 650 K and N-Li bonds dissociated completely in 3 ps. These results clearly show isolation of MXene layers is possible by inserting LiF into the MAX phase.\nSun et al. systematically studied the adsorption of Li ions on MXenes [37]. In this study, the change in the structure was investigated as a function of Li concentration with first-principles calculations. V2C was selected as a representative MXene structure due to its capability of handling high charge–discharge rates and relative atomic weight of V with respect to other transition metals in MXene structures. AIMD simulations were also carried out to observe the structural transformations.\nThe simulation time was set to 2.0 ps with 1 fs MD time step and H1H2V2CO2Li2 was used as the initial structure. Here, first and second letters represent the adsorption sites for Li atoms and for O atoms, respectively. H1, H2, and T refer to adsorption sites on top of the C atom, on top of the surface metal atom, and on top of the sublayer metal atom, respectively. The temperature of the system was set at 800, 700, 600, and 500 K. At 700 and 800 K, migration of O atoms from H1 sites to T sites was observed. However, structural transformation was not observed below 650 K due to system size and simulation length. Same MD simulations were also carried out for Ta-MXene, which has the same crystal structure as V2CO2. For Ta2CO2 case, the structure transformation into corresponding H1T phase was observed at 650 K. The O atoms on the surface of V2CO2 shifted from H2 to T sites with adsorption of Li atoms. For the fully adsorbed first layer Li, H1TV2CO2Li2 is more energetically favorable with respect to H1 H2-V2CO2Li2 phase due to localized electrons and stronger bonds.\nThe predictive power of DFT along with AIMD simulations regularly used to design novel materials based on MXene structures. Meng et al. proposed Ti3C4, MXene-like material based on Ti3C2 MXene phase, for energy storage applications [38]. In this study, AIMD technique accompanied DFT calculations to investigate multilayer adsorption behavior of this proposed structure. After 10,000 MD steps at 800 K multilayer adsorption was only observed for Na ions and not for Li ions. For the case of Li ions, extra atoms more likely tend to form Li clusters (Fig. 9.11).\nAIMD simulations are often used to support the static quantum calculations and show the fully relaxed system is stable at finite temperatures. It has been shown that MXene samples after full adsorption of heavy metal ions such as Pb and Cu\nare thermally stable at 300 K with AIMD simulations [39]. In this work, Guo et al. used 3 × 3 supercell of saturated MXenes as starting configuration. The system was allowed to relax for 15 ps with an MD step of 3 fs. Ferro-magnetic M2N (M = Fe, Co, Ni) and half-metallic Cr2N MXenes were also shown to be thermally stable at room temperatures by using AIMD [40, 41].\nAs another energy storage application, Aierken et al. considered Li intercalation between Ti2CO2 MXene structure and graphene layer [42]. They performed AIMD simulations at 100 and 300 K for 6 ps and observed a stable structure of fully adsorbed Li layer between graphene and MXene layers. In a different study, AIMD simulations were conducted to investigate the surface structure of Ti3C2 MXene after etching with HF. Ti3C2 structure was immersed in HF solutions with different concentrations, and in all cases, the surfaces were rapidly covered with H, F, and OH functional groups during the AIMD simulations [43].\nIn a separate study, the possibility of Sc2C MXene structure as an anode material for battery applications was also explored with DFT and AIMD simulations [44]. Similar to the previous study, Lv et al. carried out AIMD simulations to show that two-dimensional Sc2C MXene structure is stable at 500 K.\nThere are other works which have used the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations as a proof of the system stability. For example, Si et al. predicted the quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase in Mo2M2C3O2 structures and by performing AIMD simulation with a Nose–Hoover thermostat at 300 K and a time step of 2 fs, the thermal stability of the structure was verified [45]. If after some simulation time, no significant structural deformation is observed, it can be concluded that the structure is thermally stable at room temperature. In another work, Ling et al. studied the effect of transition metal (TM: Fe, Co, and Ni) dopants on hydrogen production through water splitting over fully oxidized vanadium carbide MXenes (V2CO2) [46]. They confirmed the stability of TM-doped V2CO2 by performing AIMD simulation for 5 ps, with a time step of 2 fs. Guo et al. studied the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting of 48 two-dimensional transition metal carbides,\n9 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of MXenes: Ab Initio, Reactive, and Non-. . . 155\nMXenes, and they found Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 structures as promising candidates for photocatalytic water splitting [47]. In order to investigate their stability in liquid water, AIMD simulations were performed at 300 K for 10 ps. The results indicated only slight vibration of atoms around their equilibrium positions suggesting that Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 would be stable in liquid water. Moreover, the normalized pair correlation functions g(r) of Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 confirmed the crystallinity of these structures under aqueous environment at around room temperature. He et al. introduced a new class of 2D magnetic materials, asymmetrically functionalized MXenes (Janus MXenes) such as Cr2CXX0 (X, X0 = H, F, Cl, Br, OH), which are fully compensated antiferromagnetic, and completely spin-polarized semiconductor [48]. They confirmed the thermal stability of the Cr2CFCl material by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K."

The latter include metal cations or polyatomic cations such as organoammonium and can be intercalated chemically or electrochemically. Due to the young age of the field of MXenes research, the majority of this chapter focuses on Ti3C2, the most well-studied MXene. It is our expectation that the principles outlined here are general and will translate to other MXene compositions, though this remains to be pursued.

Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and hydrazine monohydrate (HM) were some of the first to be intercalated.

Cations can be intercalated into MXenes either through chemical or electrochemical means and, like other materials, are subject to exchange for different cations. In clay minerals, close relatives in many aspects to MXenes, cations are a permanent fixture of the structure; they sit in the interlayer space and balance the inherent negative charges in the host sheets [1]. Such inherent negative charge has been suggested by studies of zeta potential of Ti3C2Tz, Ti3CNTz, and V2CTz (a strong function of pH, as shown in Fig. 10.1) [11, 12, 13]. In this chapter, we will use the nomenclature Ay-Mn + 1XnTz to designate a cation-intercalated structure, where A represents cations.

This was first accomplished by immersion of unintercalated MXene powders in solutions of various salts of the desired cations [10]. It was found that only salts of cations with base-forming anions, such as OH− and CH3COO−, would successfully introduce cations and other salts such as sulfates and chlorides had little to no effect of intercalating their corresponding cation. Further work showed that it was possible to introduce NH4+ during the etching process by using the cation of a bifluoride salt (NH4HF2); however, commercial bifluoride salts are not as readily available with a\ndiversity of cations as other salts [14]. Later work showed that chloride salts could indeed be used for cation intercalation, but that they needed to be present during the etching process, presumably while the MXene interlayers were expanded and exposed [15].\nDue to salt solubilities in the etchant solution, highly soluble LiCl proved to be the best for this purpose. A mixture of 10% HF and 5 molar equivalents of LiCl yielded a highly ordered multilayered Li-Ti3C2Tz [15]. A typical XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 10.2, along with a theoretical pattern, showing a match for all peaks— this level of crystallinity is typically not seen in unintercalated MXene. Refining of this method with salts of other cations proved to be unnecessary (and difficult due to lower solubilities), as the Li-intercalated MXene can be transformed via ion exchange into other intercalated complexes, as discussed later."

An important property of these materials is ion exchange, or the ability for ions in the structure to be replaced by ions in a surrounding solution, simply by means of a concentration gradient. For the case of the most well-studied MXene Ti3C2Tz, starting with Li-Ti3C2Tz, a host of intercalated structures have been prepared via ion exchange. These are listed in Table 10.1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) evidence suggests that during exchange, Li+ is fully removed and replaced [15].\nOrganoammonium cations are of great interest due to their tailorability (the range of organic structures possible is quite large) and for the ability to introduce interesting moieties and nonpolar regions into the hydrophilic MXene interlayer space.\n10 Chemical and Electrochemical Intercalation of Ions and Molecules into MXenes 165"

      "heading" : "Ion Densities in MXene Structures",
      "text" : "Of great importance to applications involving intercalated cations is the density of ions per formula unit of the MXene host. Disregarding electrochemical intercalation for now, assuming a mechanism of permanent charge in the host structure to be balanced (like in clay minerals), or a finite number of sites of charge-holding groups, there is a natural upper limit to the number of ions that can be accepted into the structure (the total capacity of ions), and an equal or smaller number that may be readily removed and exchanged (the cation exchange capacity or CEC). Various methods exist in the literature of other materials for estimating the CEC [21]. Direct chemical analysis through methods such as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and global elemental analysis has been used to quantify cations in the structure. The number of cations and the number of balancing charges ξ in the MXene structure are related simply by the valency of the cations (e.g. half as many divalent as monovalent cations are required to balance the same ξ ).\nReports to date [15, 19, 22] suggest that ξ for A-Ti3C2Tz ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, but the precision of those values is limited by either sample preparation uniformity or the analysis methods used. Muckley et al. report values for K+ at 0.14 per Ti3C2 and Mg2+ at 0.07, with H2O molecules per ion at 2 and 5, respectively, which are in decent agreement with earlier XPS analyses of 0.1–0.11 for Li+, Na+, and Rb+ [15]. For monovalent alkylammonium (AA) intercalants from Ref. [19], elemental analysis gives a value of ξ of 0.11, EDS analysis 0.12, and XPS 0.1–0.15. While the values are somewhat different, the consistency between analysis methods and samples gives evidence that the determined range of ξ is quite robust. These values are not constrained when ions are intercalated electrochemically, with the densities of cations then being generally proportional to current passed as cations enter the structure to balance the injected charge. The maximum number of intercalable cations (in a monolayer) is a function of the effective ionic radius [23], as shown theoretically for Ti3C2Tz in Fig. 10.3. These values can be sensitive to the surface composition of MXene [24]."

For simplicity’s sake, we will describe all c expansions here in terms of a single layer-to-layer spacing, or d002 in the case of P63/mmc symmetry. Understanding these driving forces is important in accurately determining what structural expansion to expect given varying conditions.

Two well-studied examples are dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and hydrazine monohydrate (HM) [25]. Treatments with HM showed an expansion of d002 to 12.5 Å (from an initial value for Ti3C2Tz of 9.75 Å). Molecular dynamics (MD) modeling was used in conjunction with experimental quantification of organic molecules using XPS to show that the HM molecules can pack into a full monolayer. This demonstrates that intercalation is spontaneous to the point of expansion of the MXene nanosheets to accommodate a monolayer of intercalant, but the effect is limited by the energy barrier of further separating the sheets. Further, the composition of the host MXene may be affected. For example, studies have shown that adsorbed H2O loss and removal of –OH surface groups can occur due to HM intercalation [26].\nDMSO intercalation into Ti3C2Tz [25] was shown to increase d002 to 17.5 Å. An additional effect was a dynamic increase in basal spacing—the intercalated DMSO drew in H2O molecules that further pushed d002 to 22.4 Å. It can also prepare the interlayer space in an expanded state to accept larger cationic species such as uranium ions [27]. Beyond the scope of this chapter, DMSO is also an important intercalant in the initial steps of delaminating and dispersing MXene nanosheets. This was later improved upon with solutions of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide by Naguib et al. [12]."

      "text" : "Cations sitting in the interlayer space counterbalance negative charges of the MXene sheets, so that there is an attractive electrostatic force between the sheets and the\ncations. Naturally, the magnitude of this force is sensitive to the cation radius and its valency. As a result, it has been shown that the degree of contraction, or expansion, of the distance between MXene sheets (relative to that of the unintercalated state) is generally proportional to the charge density of the intercalated cation, with, e.g. intercalated Mg2+ leading to a stronger contraction than K+ [15, 28, 29]. This effect can be complicated by the co-intercalation of H2O molecules as hydration shells of the cations, which is a dynamic effect sensitive to the relative humidity of the environment. This is demonstrated in Fig. 10.4 [15]. Here, Ti3C2Tz was chemically intercalated with different metal cations. Basal spacings as determined by XRD are shown with in-situ control of relative humidity. The bimodal distribution of spacings, with separation of ~2.5 Å (or the rough diameter of an H2O molecule) shows that there is a transition from monolayer- to bilayer-type intercalation. This terminology was first derived from the literature of clay minerals but is more accurately described simply as multiples of H2O molecular diameters. Recent work has shown that H2O seems to form around cations in pillars rather than in discreet layers and that amounts of H2O may be much lower than would be present in full layers [22]. The intercalated A-Ti3C2Tz samples in Fig. 10.4 are arranged in increasing ion hydration enthalpy, and it is clear that: 1) the trend of contraction with higher charge density persists and, 2) the relative humidity at which the monolayer–\n168 M. Ghidiu et al.\nbilayer transition occurs decreases with increasing cation hydration enthalpy. One of the most important realizations of these results is that d002 is dynamic, and thus the conditions in which it is measured should be carefully noted or, better yet, precisely controlled.\nFor MXenes intercalated with hydrated cations at equilibrium, the main forces at play are an electrostatic attraction between the negative MXene sheets and the positive cation, opposed by expansive pressure from H2O molecules being formed into hydration shells around the cations, which is affected by the cation hydration enthalpy (Fig. 10.5). It should be noted that the MXene surface terminations can affect the balance of these forces [30].\nAmmonium-based cations result in more varied structural changes than do metal cations. This is due to their ability to contain larger organic groups that must arrange themselves in the constricted interlayer space. Like in other materials [2, 6], using AA cations, it was shown for Ti3C2Tz that d002 could be tuned over a wide range (between 14.6 Å and 38.2 Å) by changing the physical size of the intercalated cations, highlighted in Fig. 10.6 [19]. Further, varying of the chain length of AA cations leads to interesting phenomena: the constant basal spacing between C1 and C8 and the abrupt increase between C10 and C12 demonstrate that the interlayer space can remain porous at low chain lengths, but that longer-chained cations will eventually fill the space and force the MXene layers apart. This likely proceeds through a monolayer to quasi-bilayer transition of cation chains, with even further expansion caused by paraffin-type arrangements of long-chain cations [20]. This is similar to phenomena experienced in other layered materials [31, 32, 33].\nIt has been demonstrated that AA cations can be useful as spacing templates for insertion of permanent pillaring materials, as a method to improve electrochemical capacitance [20]. AA cations represent a very interesting avenue for future work\n10 Chemical and Electrochemical Intercalation of Ions and Molecules into MXenes 169\ndue to their ability to contain functional moieties such as electrochemically active groups such as ferrocene or light-sensitive groups such as azobenzene, which have been exploited in clay minerals [34].\nWhen cations are electrochemically intercalated, the number of cations contained in the interlayer is no longer constrained to an equilibrium value. Studies have shown that the cation valency, number of cations intercalated, and cation size/structure are all important factors in understanding the changes to d002. Two dominant and competing effects are the number of positive charges intercalated and the physical cation size. MXene layers have a higher electrostatic driving force to contract when more positive charges are present in the interlayer—this is seen strongly for Li+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+ (shown in Fig. 10.7 as macroscopic height changes, related to changes in basal spacing, for various cations as they are electrochemically inserted into Ti3C2Tz) [10, 18]. The aforementioned cations tend to have a smaller ionic radius; cations of a larger physical size such as K+, Cs+, and the alkylammonium cations will still cause electrostatic attraction, but the limited volume in the MXene interlayer when packed with increasing amounts of these cations eventually causes an expansion of the MXene to accommodate them. The effect of valency on contraction is an extension of this idea, as more charge can\n170 M. Ghidiu et al.\nbe contained in a smaller physical space. In the isolated case of Na+, bilayers of cations have been observed at high potential—in Fig. 10.7, Na+ is seemingly near a balance of the effects of charge vs. size, so it may be the case that it is easier to eventually fill all space in the monolayer and force an expansion of the MXene at high Na+ packing [35]."

These intercalated samples showed distributions of Young’s moduli that could be due to the result of various sites for Mg2+ ions, and the spatial distributions had a high degree of heterogeneity. Pre-intercalation with K+ ions, followed by Mg2+, displayed a more uniform spatial response. While the ability to tune Young’s modulus was only demonstrated in depth for Mg2+, the intercalation of a range of alkali and alkaline earth cations has shown that mechanical deformations can be readily controlled [29].\n10 Chemical and Electrochemical Intercalation of Ions and Molecules into MXenes 171"

Early reports showed that the permeation rates of ions were dependent on their charge and radius, with the rates of monovalent cations being much faster than those of their multivalent counterparts [28]. Within the monovalent cations, a general trend was observed that K+ moved more slowly through the MXene interlayer space than Na+ or Li+. In the same work, the flux of water across membranes was shown to decrease with increasing valency of cations present in solution. This was suggested to originate from higher-valency ions constricting the interlayers and is supported by theoretical work showing dynamic response of MXene basal spacing, as well as differences in energy barriers for ionic movement through MXenes [37]. More recent reports, using neutron techniques and MD to probe the movement of H2O in intercalated samples, suggest that the diffusion coefficients for H2O decrease on the order Li+ > Na+ > K+ [38]. This is in agreement with earlier observations that the ion permeation rates follow roughly the same trend. Interestingly, H2O in MXene without intercalated ions was found to behave more like bulk water in terms of diffusion, while ion intercalation lowered the diffusion coefficient by about two orders of magnitude. On a final note, these studies also suggested, through modeling, that the ions reside in different locations based on their chemistry—with Li+ closer to the MXene sheet faces and Na+ and K+ closer to the center of the interlayer space along with the H2O molecules (Fig. 10.8).\n172 M.

Work on K- and Mg-Ti3C2Tz, into which H2O molecules intercalate as a function of the relative humidity in the environment, showed that the electrical resistivity of the MXene increases to R/R0 of 1.03–1.05 at the high end of relative humidity tested, about 80%; the response was also linear, leading to the MXene being a candidate for humidity sensing [22]. Further, the loss in mass, from deintercalating H2O upon decrease in relative humidity, was faster than the recovery of the electrical conductivity, leading to the conclusion that trapped H2O molecules that are more slowly removed from the structure can act as charge-depleting dopants, though after equilibration the resistivity increase was found to be reversible. Other reports on spin-coated films showed a fully reversible ~26-fold increase in film resistivity upon exposure to 80% relative humidity [39]. Adsorbed H2O clearly has a noticeable effect on the resistivity of MXene.\nWhen Ti3C2Tz was intercalated with AA cations of the form [(CH3)3NCn H2n + 1]+ (variable alkyl chain length cations), the resistivity was found to generally increase with increasing chain length of cation [19]. This may be tied to the concomitant increase in d002. Because of the massive structural changes (with basal spacing increasing up to ~28 Å per interlayer), disruption of interparticle electrical contacts may also play a role."

      "text" : "A large question that still remains outstanding is where exactly the negative charge of MXene sheets originates or resides. This charge is required to balance cations considering they selectively intercalate. It is likely that –OH terminations on the MXene surfaces are deprotonated to form –O−, which may then electrostatically interact with cations. This has been invoked in work involving ion sequestration [13], and a mechanism of transformation between –OH/–O groups was invoked with Raman spectroscopic evidence as a reason for MXene’s high capacitance, with the deprotonation responsible for forming H3O+ cations [40]. Like in clay minerals, the negative charge balancing interlayer cations could also originate from within the MXene sheets rather than on surface groups, as has been demonstrated during electrochemical cycling [41].\nAnother complexity is the fact that MXene is a redox active material. Thus, species that are intended for intercalation into MXenes may undergo chemical changes upon intercalation or even from initial contact with MXene, before any intercalation. This was demonstrated recently, where it was shown that the process of intercalating urea into Ti3C2Tz resulted in decomposition of the urea, yielding instead an intercalation of NH4+ and evolution of CO2 [42]. While this may not be a general phenomenon, it is certainly something that must be taken into account in the design of intercalated MXenes.\n10 Chemical and Electrochemical Intercalation of Ions and Molecules into MXenes 173"

Arguably, the entire field of 2D materials was born in 2004 when single layers of graphene were exfoliated from graphite, and their electronic properties were studied [1]. The demonstration of such a high quality and stable free-standing atomic layers prepared the grounds for the extensive ongoing research on synthesis and characterization of 2D materials. Currently, the term “2D materials” refers to the atomically thin single/few-layer flakes (or sheets) of various materials with thicknesses ranging from 1 to less than 5 nm [2–5]. A single layer of a 2D material can consist of a single atomic layer (such as graphene, phosphorene, etc.) or a single crystalline layer with several atomic layers (such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, etc.). Delamination (complete separation of individual layers from a layered structure) of single-layer flakes from layered materials has been achieved through a verity of methods including mechanical cleavage, chemical intercalation and exfoliation, and liquid exfoliation, to name a few [3, 4, 6]. Similarly, several techniques for the synthesis of single/fewlayer flakes of MXenes have been reported in the past few years. MXenes are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with a general formula of Mn + 1XnTx, where M is a transition metal, X is carbon or nitrogen, n can be 1, 2, or 3, and Tx represents the surface terminations [5]. As it has been explained in Chap. 5, MXenes are produced by selective etching of A layer elements (i.e., Al) from a large group of layered ternary carbides and nitrides, called MAX\nA.

      "text" : "Delaminated single-layer 2D materials often exhibit very different properties compared to their bulk layered counterparts. That is partly due to a significant increase in the surface area to volume ratio of the 2D flakes which can dramatically change the (electro)chemical and physical properties of the material [6, 7]. For example, unlike graphite or few-layer graphene, single-layer graphene sheets are zero-band gap semiconductors and show extraordinary high electron mobility at room temperature (RT) [2, 8]. However, these electronic properties rapidly change by increasing the number of layers in graphene sheets [1, 9, 10]. In the case of MXenes, it is also shown that delamination of multilayered MXene particles into single/few-layer flakes can significantly affect their properties. For example, delaminated MXene flakes have shown better electrochemical performances in different energy storage applications [11–16]. Therefore, it is crucial to successfully delaminate MXenes into single-layer flakes and harness their unique 2D properties. Mechanical cleavage or the so-called “scotch tape” technique has been used to isolate single-layer flakes of a variety of layered materials with strong in-plane bonds and weak van der Waals bonds between their layers [4]. Although this technique allows scientists to isolate single-layer 2D flakes and study their properties, its limited scalability prevents large-scale synthesis of 2D materials. Liquid exfoliation methods have also been widely applied to delaminate single-layer flakes of layered materials [6]. However, 2D MXenes cannot be directly produced through mechanical cleavage or direct liquid exfoliation of their parent MAX phases due to the nature of interlayer bonds in these ternary carbides. The MX layers of MAX phases are bonded with strong primary bonds (M—A bonds), which mostly have metallic character [5, 17, 18]. However, since the M—A bonds are more reactive than M—X bonds (with mixed ionic and covalent character), under certain conditions, the “A” atoms can be selectively removed in acidic environments. The readers are referred to Chap. 5 of this book for more details about this selective removal process. The resulting products of this process are usually multilayered particles of MXene (ML-MXene) and have a microstructure that resembles that of exfoliated graphite [5]. The separation of the individual single/few-layer flakes from the ML-MXene particles is not always straightforward. In many cases, the interactions between the layers in the ML-MXene are very strong. Moreover, for some MXenes the\n11 Techniques for MXene Delamination into Single-Layer Flakes 179\ncurrent etching processes usually result in an incomplete etching and some residual strongly bonded A layer elements remain between the M-X layers, hindering their delamination using simple techniques. Therefore, to delaminate ML-MXenes into single/few-layer flakes, usually an additional step (usually a liquid-based delamination method) for expanding the interlayer space and weakening the interaction between layers is required. This is usually achieved by chemical intercalation of large organic/inorganic molecules between the MXene layers. In principle, intercalation of large molecules and ionic species results in an increased interlayer spacing and weakens the out-of-plane interactions between stacked MXene layers [7]. This is usually followed by a substantial swelling of the MXene powders due to co-intercalation of water molecules. The outcome of this intercalation process, if proper intercalants and process conditions are selected, is reduction of the energy barrier for delamination of MXenes [7]. As a result, subsequent agitation of dispersion of ML-MXenes (by ultrasonication or hand-shaking) could lead to delamination of single-/few-layer MXene flakes. The delamination process will be further discussed in this chapter in a case-by-case fashion as different MXenes require different delamination conditions. Figure 11.1 schematically shows different steps involved in the delamination of ML-MXenes into single-/few-layer flakes.\nTi3C2Tx is the most studied MXene in terms of synthesis, exfoliation, and delamination methods, as well as potential applications (note that Tx in the formula of MXene represents the functional groups that terminate the surface of the material). In the early reports on the synthesis of this material, the largescale delamination of single/few-layer Ti3C2Tx flakes was carried out by chemical intercalation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into ML-Ti3C2Tx powder produced by selective etching of Al from Ti3AlC2 in a concentrated hydrogen fluoride (HF) solution (50%) at room temperature [11, 16]. This intercalation process resulted in the expansion of layer spacing and a large increase (about 15.4 Å) in the c-lattice parameter (c-LP) of ML-Ti3C2Tx [11, 16]. Co-intercalation of water molecules has been mentioned as the reason for such large change in the c-LP upon DMSO intercalation [5].\nThe increase in the c-LP significantly weakens the interaction between M-X layers and the sonication of interlayer-expanded ML-Ti3C2Tx in water results in the delamination of single/few layer MXene flakes [11, 16]. As further explained in the next section, this two-step etching and delamination process (schematically illustrated in Fig. 11.1) has been successfully used for delamination of various other MXene compositions (by using a variety of intercalants). In 2014, Ghidiu et al. reported a facile and efficient one-step method for the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx [12]. In this method, instead of concentrated HF solutions, a solution of lithium fluoride (or other fluoride salts) and hydrochloric acid is used as the etchant. During the etching process, Al atoms are removed from Ti3AlC2, and the hydrated Li ions are simultaneously intercalated between the M-X layers, leading to their delamination into single/few-layer Ti3C2Tx flakes. This synthesis technique is schematically shown in Fig. 11.1. Later, it was shown that the synthesis conditions can be tuned to produce large-area and high-quality Ti3C2Tx single-layer flakes [19].\n180 A. VahidMohammadi et al.\nIn the past few years, the two general MXene delamination methods have been applied to other MXene compositions as well. For many MXenes, the two-step process of etching and intercalation has been the only successful method of delamination. However, it has been found that specific conditions of the delamination process, such as the type of intercalant, are dependent on the etching method. Therefore, it is essential that we consider the etching process in our discussion of various delamination techniques.\n11 Techniques for MXene Delamination into Single-Layer Flakes 181\nChemical Intercalation and Delamination of Ti3C2Tx into Single/Few-Layer Flakes\nAs mentioned earlier, chemical pre-intercalation of ML-MXene powder is an important requirement for the delamination of MXenes that are produced in concentrated HF solutions. The spontaneous chemical intercalation of a wide range of organic molecules and solvents such as ethanol, acetone, thiophene, formaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, hexane, toluene, hydrazine, dimethylformamide (DMF), DMSO, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), and urea into various multilayered MXenes have been previously demonstrated [11, 16, 20, 21]. The intercalated MXenes usually have large c-LPs and weak interlayer bonds [16]. For Ti3C2Tx, delamination of single-layer flakes by sonication of the dispersion of the intercalated ML-Ti3C2Tx has been demonstrated by several studies [11, 20– 22]. Table 11.1 summarizes various etching processes, intercalation conditions, and intercalant types that have been reported so far for successful delamination of MLTi3C2Tx into single or few-layer flakes.\nIt is worth noting that the direct sonication of HF-etched Ti3AlC2 powder at room temperature may yield a small amount of single/double-layer flakes among the produced ML-Ti3C2Tx particles, but the pre-intercalation is always required for the large-scale delamination of single-layer flakes [18, 20]. Utilizing the intercalation and sonication method for the delamination of Ti3C2Tx was first reported by Mashtalir et al. [16] where they intercalated ML-Ti3C2Tx particles with several organic compounds, such as DMSO and urea (increasing the c-LP of MXene to ~35 Å and ~25 Å, respectively) and subsequently delaminated the Ti3C2Tx flakes by a sonication process. In a typical process, ML-Ti3C2Tx powder (synthesized by etching Ti3AlC2 powder in 50% HF solutions) was dispersed and stirred in DMSO (in a 0.6 g to 10 mL ratio) at room temperature for 18 h. The powder was then washed several times to remove the residual DMSO and then was dispersed in water and sonicated for 4 h to achieve dispersions of single/few-layer Ti3C2Tx flakes [11, 16]. In our experience, shaking the DMSO intercalated Ti3C2Tx powders may also result in delamination of Ti3C2Tx into single-layer flakes, however, the delamination yield increases by using sonication instead of shaking.\nThe delamination of ML-MXene through pre-intercalation and sonication (technique 1 in Fig. 11.1) is not limited to materials synthesized by etching in HF solutions. However, MXenes produced by alternative etching methods may require different delamination conditions. There have been a few reports on the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx by etching the precursor MAX powders or thin films in solutions of ammonium hydrogen fluoride (NH4HF2) or ammonium fluoride [22–24, 26]. Although the materials obtained from this etching process can be grounded to produce some single-layer fragments [24], the direct delamination of Ti3C2Tx sheets through these methods has not been reported. During this etching process, NH4+ cations intercalate between the layers of the synthesized MXenes and increase their c-LP. However, the increased d-spacing does not lead to a complete delamination of the flakes and further intercalation and sonication processes are required [20]. The\n182 A.

In the reported process, MLTi3C2Tx powders (synthesized by HF etching) were dispersed in a 5 wt% NaOH aqueous solution and the dispersion was stirred for 2 h to allow the intercalation of Na+ cations between MXene layers. Next, sulfanilic acid diazonium salt was mixed with the Na+-intercalated Ti3C2Tx powder at 0–5 ◦C for 4 h. Wang et al. reported that the expansion of interlayer spacing of the MXene due to the intercalation of aryl groups and the chemical interaction of phenylsulfonic groups with the negatively charged surface of the Ti3C2Tx result in the weakening of the interaction between Ti3C2Tx layers and enhances their delamination in water to form stable MXene dispersions [27].\nAnother delamination process for producing Ti3C2Tx flakes was reported by Xuan et al. [25]. They used tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) to directly delaminate 2D flakes in a process that avoids excessive use of HF. In the suggested process, the Ti3AlC2 powder was first treated in a 10–20% HF solution for 30 minutes and then dispersed in a 25% aqueous solution of TMAOH. It was claimed that the short HF treatment is only for the removal of the oxide layer that usually exists on the surface of Ti3AlC2 particles, although slight removal of Al atoms from the structure is also possible [25]. However, the etching process mainly proceeds in the aqueous solution of TMAOH according to the reaction (11.1). The Al is removed from the MAX phase structure through the reaction with OH− while TMA+ cations intercalate between the Ti3C2Tx layers:\n2Al + 2OH− + 6H2O → 2 [ Al(OH)4 ]− + 3H2 (11.1) As it can be seen from this reaction, the mechanism of etching and delamination in this technique is quite different from the previously explained methods. Nevertheless, shaking the dispersions of TMA+ intercalated MXene particles in water resulted in producing single-/double-layer flakes with thicknesses of around 1.6– 2.0 nm [25].\nSingle-Step Etching and Delamination of Ti3C2Tx and the Effects of Etching Parameters on the Size of the MXene Flakes\nAs briefly explained above, treatment of some MXenes in mixtures of fluoride salts and acids (e.g., HCl) may lead to the simultaneous synthesis (etching) and delamination of MXene flakes [12, 26]. This process (schematically shown as technique 2 in Fig. 11.1) was first reported by Ghidiu et al. [12]. In their proposed process, the single-step etching and delamination of Ti3C2Tx sheets was achieved by the treatment of the Ti3AlC2 in a solution of lithium fluoride (LiF) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Due to the existence of fluoride ions and protons in the etching solution, the chemical reactions similar to those observed in the HF solutions result in the\n184 A. VahidMohammadi et al.\nselective removal of Al atoms from the MAX phase structure. Also, the concurrent intercalation of water molecules and hydrated Li+ cations between the MXene layers significantly increases the c-LP of Ti3C2Tx, leading to the delamination of individual layers. This process yields a MXene powder with a clay-like behavior which can be rolled into a few micron thick flexible films that are highly conductive (~1500 S/cm) when dried [12]. Highly concentrated and stable dispersions of single/few layer MXene flakes can be produced by sonication or hand-shaking of the Ti3C2Tx clay in water. The size of the flakes in the as-synthesized clay is reported to be between 0.5 and 1.5µm [12]. However, the MXene sheets tend to break into smaller sizes during the sonication of their dispersions [28, 29]. Therefore, the delaminated Ti3C2Tx sheets obtained in this method usually have sub-micrometer dimensions [12].\nSince the introduction of the single-step etching and delamination, this method has largely replaced the HF etching processes for the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx. Therefore, it is worth to explain the details of this synthesis process further in this chapter. Usually, the process starts with preparation of an etchant by mixing 10 mL of 6 M HCl and 5 M equivalent LiF (0.66 g). The mixture should be stirred for at least 5 minutes to dissolve LiF. The etching process starts with a gradual addition of MAX phase powder (1 g of Ti3AlC2) to the etchant. This step is usually performed in an ice bath (over the course of 5–10 minutes) to prevent overheating of the solution due to the exothermic nature of the reaction between the MAX phase and the etchant. Etching is continued by continuous stirring of the mixture at 35 ◦C for 24 h, after which the mixture is poured into centrifuge tubes and diluted with deionized water for washing the exfoliated material. The etched powders are washed with the addition of deionized (DI) water and several steps of centrifugation. After each centrifugation, the supernatant should be decanted and the sediment should be dispersed in deionized water followed by shaking the centrifuge tube. This consecutive dilution and centrifuge process is usually repeated until the pH value of the supernatant is about 5–6. At this point, a clay-like MXene powder can be formed by filtering and drying the final sediment. To delaminate the sheets into individual layers, the clay-like MXene powder is usually dispersed in deionized water (~1 g to 200 mL) and probe sonicated for 1 h under flowing Argon. The resulting solution is centrifuged to remove any residual unreacted MAX phase or multilayered MXene particles. The supernatant collected at the last step is a stable dispersion of delaminated Ti3C2Tx with a dark green color [20].\nIn the salt and acid mixture etching/delamination technique, etching and postetching processing conditions can significantly affect the quality and dimensions of the produced Ti3C2Tx sheets. A few studies have shown that the molar ratios of LiF and HCl can affect the dimensions of the produced MXene flakes [19, 30, 31]. For example, by increasing the molar ratio of LiF to Ti3AlC2 from 5 to 7.5, and the molar ratio of HCl to Ti3AlC2 from 11.7 to 23.4, larger sheet sizes (up to 15µm) can be synthesized [19]. This is mainly due to the enhanced delamination of the flakes that can be achieved without the application of high power sonication, leading to preservation of the original size of the produced MXene flakes. Therefore, these modified synthesis processes enable applications or characterization methods\n11 Techniques for MXene Delamination into Single-Layer Flakes 185\nthat require larger flake sizes [29, 30]. The adjustment of the composition of the etchant is the basis for a recently developed MXene synthesis process referred to as minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) process. In this process, a simple shaking of the as-etched MXenes in water can produce flakes with large lateral dimensions and high qualities (Fig. 11.2). Recently, Alhabeb et al. reported\n186 A. VahidMohammadi et al.\na comprehensive account of MXene synthesis using this method, which suggests that for MILD etching the concentration of LiF should be kept higher than a certain threshold [20]. They proposed an optimized MILD synthesis method where the concentrations of LiF and HCl in the etchant were increased to 12 and 9 M, respectively. It was observed that increasing the concentration of Li+ cations and H+ ions further facilitates the delamination; thus, MXene dispersions with higher concentrations (1–2 mg/mL) could be produced. Table 11.2 shows a comparison of different Ti3C2Tx synthesis methods based on the etching of MAX phase in the mixture of fluoride salts and HCl.\nAnother notable difference between the clay method (5 M LiF and 6 M HCl) and the MILD methods (both 7.5 M LiF/6 M HCl and 12 M LiF/9 M HCl) is the swelling of Ti3C2Tx sediment after washing. The swelling of the ML-Ti3C2Tx sediments is more pronounced and noticeable in the MILD processes. After washing, two different phases can be seen at the bottom of the centrifuge tubes; a grey sediment and a dark black slurry, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Characterization of both phases with XRD suggests that the grey sediment is likely to be a mixture of un-etched Ti3AlC2 and ML-Ti3C2Tx, and the dark black slurry is likely composed of single and few layers Ti3C2Tx flakes. The separation of the slurry from the grey sediment can be done with an additional centrifuge step, and the slurry can be used to obtain Ti3C2Tx flakes.\nThe MILD method for the synthesis and delamination of Ti3C2Tx involves the following experimental steps. At first, an etchant is prepared by adding 1 g (or 1.6 g in the optimized MILD process) of LiF to 20 mL of 6 M (or 9 M in the optimized MILD process) HCl solution. The mixture is stirred for 5 minutes using a Teflon coated magnetic bar. Then, 1 g of Ti3AlC2 powder is gradually added to the etchant in an ice bath over the course of 5 minutes. The reaction mixture is then removed from the ice bath and stirred in a 35 ◦C water bath for 24 h. The reaction products are washed with several centrifugations steps of 5 minutes at 3500 rpm followed by a gentle hand shaking of the products for less than one minute. After around five cycles of washing, a stable dark-green supernatant is obtained. At this point, the grey sediment and the black slurry shown in Fig. 11.3(b) can be separated by centrifuging the mixture at 3500 rpm for 2 minutes.\nThe average size and the quality of the Ti3C2Tx flakes can be controlled to some extent by adjusting the synthesis parameters. However, for all the reported synthesis methods the final produced MXenes have a large size distribution between a few nanometers to few microns. To produce MXene flakes with controlled average sizes and size distributions, post-synthesis methods such as sonication [29] and centrifugation [20, 32] can be applied to separate the flakes based on their size. For example, following up the previous reports [20, 29, 32, 33] and as we have recently shown in our laboratory [34], larger MXene flakes can be separated from the solution by high-speed centrifugation (Fig. 11.4a). Then, if smaller MXene flakes are required (e.g., to study the size-dependent property of MXenes), the large flakes can be uniformly broken to smaller ones by applying high power sonication to their dispersions in water (Fig. 11.4). However, during the sonication of MXene dispersions (either during the synthesis or post-synthesis treatments),\n11 Techniques for MXene Delamination into Single-Layer Flakes 187\nTa bl\ne 11\n.2 C\nom pa\nri so\nn of\ndi ff\ner en\nt et\nch in\ng co\nnd iti\non s\nth at\nre su\nlt in\ndi re\nct an\nd on\nest\nep ex\nfo lia\ntio n\nan d\nde la\nm in\nat io\nn of\nT i 3\nA lC\n2 in\nto si\nng le\n/f ew\n-l ay\ner T\ni 3 C\n2 T x fla ke s di sp er se d in w at er\nM et\nho d\nM as\ns (T\ni 3 A\nlC 2 )\nM as\ns (L\niF )\nV ol\num e\nan d\nco nc\nen tr\nat io\nn (H\nC l)\nM ol\nar ra tio T i 3 A lC 2 :L\niF :H\nC l\nSo ni\nca tio\nn C\nom m\nen ts\nR ef\ner en\nce s\nC la\ny m\net ho\nd 1\ng 0.\n67 g\n10 m\nL 6\nM 1:\n5: 11\n.7 N\nee de\nd, 1\nh –\n[1 2]\nM IL\nD m\net ho\nd 1\ng 1\ng 20\nm L\n6 M\n1: 7.\n5: 23\n.4 N\not ne\ned ed\nIm pr\nov ed\nsi ze\nan d\nqu al\nity of\nth e\nsh ee\nts (c\nom pa\nre d\nw ith\nth e\ncl ay\nm et\nho d)\n[1 9,\n29 ,3\n1, 32\n]\nO pt\nim iz\ned M\nIL D\nm et\nho d\n1 g\n1. 6\ng 20\nm L\n9 M\n1: 12\n:3 5.\n1 N\not ne\ned ed\nT he\nco nc\nen tr\nat io\nn of\nth e\nde la\nm in\nat ed\nT i 3\nC 2 T\nx sh\nee ts\nis im\npr ov\ned (c\nom pa\nre d\nw ith\nth e\nM IL\nD m\net ho\nd)\n[2 0]\n188 A.

Using ice bath during the sonication to dissipate generated heat as well as maintaining an Argon flow to deaerate water are effective methods that can minimize MXene oxidation.\nWhile separation of the flakes with various sizes can be used to obtain flakes with specific average sizes and size distribution [20, 29, 32, 33, 34], the maximum achievable size of the produced sheets is limited by the grain size of precursor MAX phase used in the synthesis of MXenes. Therefore, to synthesize sheets with larger lateral sizes, larger MAX phase crystals should be synthesized."

      "text" : "In contrast to Ti3C2Tx, information on the delamination of other MXenes into stable solutions containing single and/or few layers flakes is very limited in the literature. This is despite the fact that multilayered powders of a variety of MXenes have been experimentally produced and some have shown exceptional properties in various applications [14, 15, 35]. Some of the approaches that are already proven to be effective for delamination of Ti3C2Tx (discussed earlier in this chapter) have not been successful for delamination of other MXene compositions. This has prevented extended studies of the properties and applications of delaminated single/few layer flakes of MXenes other than Ti3C2Tx. So far, the most significant report on the largescale delamination of other MXenes is the work by Naguib et al. [36] in which they successfully delaminated MXenes, such as V2CTx and Ti3CNTx using an intercalation and agitation approach. The process is similar to the pre-intercalation and delamination process previously used for the delamination of Ti3C2Tx flakes (route 1 shown in Fig. 11.1). However, for delaminating V2CTx and Ti3CNTx large organic bases were used as the intercalants in the pre-intercalation step [36, 37]. It should be noted that the one-step etching and delamination technique used by a mixture of metal salts and acids has not been reported to be effective for the direct delamination of other MXenes (except for Ti2CTx and Mo2CTx) [35, 38– 40]. However, if the mixture etching method is effective in complete removal of the A layers from the MAX structure, similar to the MXenes etched with HF, post chemical intercalation might be used to fully delaminate the ML-MXene powders.\nV2CTx and Ti3CNTx (representatives of M2X and M3X2 family of MXenes) were delaminated using immersion of the multilayered powders (etched in 48% HF for 92 h for V2CTx and 30% HF for 18 h for Ti3CNTx) in TBAOH, choline hydroxide, and n-butylamine in a ratio of 1 g MXene powder to 10 mL of intercalant solution for different time periods of 2, 4, and 21 h [36]. In this method, after washing and removal of excess TBAOH (or other intercalants) from the treated powders, both V2CTx and Ti3CNTx powders become swollen. By adding water and handshaking them, black colloidal solutions of single and few layers MXenes can be obtained. TBAOH treatment of 4 h was found to be the\n190 A. VahidMohammadi et al.\noptimal condition for successful delamination of V2CTx and Ti3CNTx [36]. For the swollen V2CTx, the (0002) peak in the XRD pattern shifted from 2θ of 8.9 to 4.56◦ corresponding to c-LP of 38.72 Å (9.4 Å increase in the d-spacing). Similar results were observed for the intercalated Ti3CNTx where the (0002) peak was shifted down from 8.26 to 4.5◦ corresponding to a c-LP of 39.2 Å and an 8.9 Å increase in the d-spacing. Figure 11.5 shows an AFM image of a single-layer V2CTx flake obtained from 4 h TBAOH treatment of the ML-V2CTx powder at room temperature. The delaminated V2CTx solution was produced by handshaking of the TBAOH intercalated powder in deionized water and centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 1 h.\nDelamination of Ti2CTx and Mo2CTx have been reported through single-step etching method in a solution of LiF and HCl [35, 41, 42]. It was reported that Ti2AlC etched with a mixture of 6 M HCl and 1.1 g LiF for 36 h at 40 ◦C using 1 g of MAX phase powder in 30 mL of the etchant can be delaminated by sonication (1.5 h) and centrifugation (3500 rpm for 5 minutes) [41]. Lateral size and number of the layers of the delaminated Ti2CTx MXene solution produced by this technique have not been examined [41]. Besides, considering the duration of the centrifugation used in this process, there is a high probability that the produced solution consists of few-layer to many-layer flakes. Higher centrifugation times are needed to make sure the delaminated solutions only consist of single/few-layer flakes. It has been reported that ML-Mo2CTx powder prepared through HF etching (14 M HF in a 1 g powder to 40 mL acid ratio for 160 h at 55 ◦C) [42] can be delaminated by TBAOH intercalation (1 g powder to 10 mL 54–56% TBAOH solution ratio for 18 h). The delaminated Mo2CTx has also been prepared in LiF and HCl mixture etchant (12 M HCl with 3 M equivalent LiF [42] or 9 M HCl with 4 g LiF both at 35 ◦C for 72 h and in a 2 g powder to 20 mL etchant\n11 Techniques for MXene Delamination into Single-Layer Flakes 191\nratio [35]) followed by several steps of washing, handshaking for 5 minutes (or 45 minutes sonication) [35], and centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 1 h (3500 rpm for 1 h) [35].\nIn general, the chemical pre-intercalation and sonication method seems to be a very effective method for delamination of all MXene compositions. Table 11.3 summarizes the delamination processes reported so far for a variety of MXene compositions. One problem associated with delaminated MXenes beyond Ti3C2Tx is their instability and fast oxidation in the water. For example, delaminated V2CTx flakes dispersed in water are reported to quickly degrade over a few hours when exposed to air in an open container [36, 37]. Therefore, for future characterization of these MXene flakes methods for proper storage of their dispersions and new techniques for their delamination should be developed."

      "heading" : "Conclusion and Outlook",
      "text" : "The knowledge and techniques for synthesizing single-/few-layer MXenes have been evolving since the discovery of these materials. Producing MXene flakes differs from synthesizing other 2D materials (i.e., graphene, MoS2, and h-BN) since the former usually requires an initial selective etching process to produce multilayered materials. As we discussed throughout this chapter, among different experimentally synthesized MXenes, the delamination techniques for Ti3C2Tx have been very well established in the literature. Dispersions of single-/few-layer Ti3C2Tx can be prepared in high concentrations and the dimensions of the flakes and their stability can be controlled. However, preparation of delaminated MXenes other than Ti3C2Tx is still challenging. Despite some reports on delamination of V2CTx and Mo2CTx that we summarized in this chapter, the knowledge about the properties of the delaminated flakes, the yield of delamination to single layers, and the scalability of delamination process is limited. Chemical intercalation techniques can be considered as an effective approach for delamination of MLMXenes that their selective exfoliation process does not directly result in single layer solutions. On the other hand, as we pointed out in this chapter, we believe that optimizing the salt/acid mixture etchants for MXene compositions other than Ti3C2Tx may lead to the development of concurrent etching/delamination processes. Therefore, we suggest that the future work in this area should focus on the systematic studies of the effect of the composition of etchant, as well as the etching conditions on the synthesis of single-/few-layer MXene flakes of various compositions.\n192 A.

      "text" : "A unique family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, MXene (Mn+1XnTx, where n = 1, 2, or 3, M is an early transition metal, X is C and/ or N, and T is a terminating group), was discovered in 2011 [1, 2]. In addition to their excellent mechanical properties (e.g., bending rigidities) [3], rich surface chemistries (e.g., hydrophilic [4] and hydrophobic [5]), and metallic conductivity [6, 7], this type of material offers particularly tunable transition metal chemistries [8] compared with other carbon-based conductive material (as shown in Table 12.1). More importantly, this material is produced by simply etching and exfoliating MAX phases, and this relatively simple technique may enable manufacturing-scale production [7]. Therefore, this material has been explored in various fields such as energy storage (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors), optics, electronics, catalysts, and medical applications. Recently, a variety of methods have been developed to process MXene into films or coatings for specific applications. This chapter 12 (i) introduces the basic principle of these typical methods for MXene films, coatings, and bulk processing and (ii) discusses the challenges and future direction of MXene processing.\nG.-M.

      "heading" : "Vacuum-Assisted Filtration",
      "text" : "Using vacuum-assisted filtration (VAF) to form a MXene film is a common method since it requires no complex apparatus [21, 22]. As shown in Fig. 12.1a, a uniform dispersion of MXene [24] is firstly prepared and filtered through a porous membrane with the suction filter device. Since filtration is intrinsically self-limiting, the\n12 MXene Films, Coatings, and Bulk Processing 199\nuniformity of the film on the filter membrane is therefore self-leveling [27]. In certain circumstances, van der Waals forces are involved for bringing the species together [28]. The next step is to peel off the deposited MXene film (Fig. 12.1b) from the filter paper where a 1.5-μm-thick MXene film can be obtained (Fig. 12.1c). We note that each filter parameter is significant (e.g., the type of filter paper, the vacuum pressure, the dispersion concentration, and the surfactant type). Among these, the solution concentration of the deposited material is the most important factor to adjust film properties such as thickness, opacity, rigidity, and conductivity [27]. The VAF technique can also be used to combine different materials into a film. For example, Zhao et al. demonstrated that MXene and CNTs can be combined by alternatively filtering two types of dispersions (e.g., Fig. 12.1a) through a filter paper, where sandwich-like and flexible MXene-MWCNT films (Fig. 12.1d–f) can be successfully obtained [24]. Other modified MXene films like MnOx-Ti3C2 film [26] can be obtained by three steps: (i) simple modification of the MXene dispersion with Mn(NO3)2, (ii) VAF, and (iii) heat treatment of the filtered film (Fig. 12.1g).\nRecently, Zhao et al. [29] and Lukatskaya et al. [30] prepared new types of 3D macroporous MXene films (which consist of hollow MXene spheres) via VAF\n200 G.-M. Weng et al.\n(Fig. 12.2). We show the preparation procedure in Fig. 12.2a: (i) MXene flakes spontaneously wrap around the surface of PMMA spheres based on the interaction between their surface hydroxyl groups; (ii) VAF; (iii) thermal annealing of the MXene/PMMA films at 450 ◦C to remove PMMA and transformed into a 3D macroporous MXene film. This method can be generalized to various MXenes (Fig. 12.2b–d), e.g., Ti3C2Tx, V2CTx, and Mo2CTx, and the thickness of the film can be up to ~45 μm (Fig. 12.2f). Other post-treatments of the filtered MXene film, like hydrazine treatment, can lead to MXene foam films with extremely low density (Fig. 12.2e).\nTo further improve the flexibility and mechanical strength, polymer can be added as a filler of the MXene film [6, 22]. In Fig. 12.3, Ling et al. [22] firstly reported the fabrication of conductive, flexible, freestanding MXene-polymer films via VAF. A strong interaction between the polymer and MXene is key for successfully preparing the polymer-modified MXene dispersion before VAF, for instance, electrostatic absorbtion [22] between positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and MXene negatively charged surface (Fig. 12.3a), and hydrogen bonding [31] between poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and MXene (Fig. 12.3a). By introducing 10 and 60 wt% PVA into the MXene film, the tensile strength could be improved by 34% and 100%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 12.3b, c, the Ti3C2TxPVA film can support ~15,000 times its own weight, while ~4000 times for its Ti3C2Tx counterpart. Taken together, these research highlights demonstrate the level of versatility possible in creating MXene films via VAF.\n12 MXene Films, Coatings, and Bulk Processing 201"

      "heading" : "Electrohydrodynamic Atomization",
      "text" : "The electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) technique, also referred to as electrospraying, is a non-vacuum process that is reasonably inexpensive for easy processing and requires less material [32, 33]. EHDA involves the flow of dispersion under the influence of an electric field at ambient temperature (Fig. 12.4a) [33]. Due to the applied electric field, the liquid forms a cone at the exit of the capillary, and from the cone apex, a jet evolves [33]. The jet breakup of a pendent droplet under the influence of an electric field has been explored by both Zeleny et al. and Taylor [34, 35]. Among all the atomization modes (e.g., micro-dripping, spindle, cone-jet, and multi-jet), the stable cone-jet atomization mode is the most important mode as near-monodispersed droplets of only a few micrometers in size are generated by this mode [36]. The stable cone-jet mode occurs when there is comparative equity in the electric field strength and surface tension of the flowing medium. The parameters that control the droplet size generated from atomization under the conejet mode include the applied voltage, the flow rate, and the physical properties of the liquid (e.g., density, viscosity, surface tension, relative permittivity, and electrical conductivity) [33]. Once the droplets are generated, the solvent evaporates very quickly because of its high surface area, and the film instantly forms [37]. Using EHDA to fabricate Ti3C2Tx film was firstly demonstrated by Ali et al. [32] with the setup shown in Fig. 12.4a. A uniform and pinhole-free surface morphology of these Ti3C2Tx films (100–400 nm) was observed (Fig. 12.4b). It was also demonstrated that the Ti3C2Tx films could be further improved by modifying the EHDA dispersion with other functional materials (e.g., graphene, CNTs, and metal oxide) with great potential for utilization in photo-electronics, energy storage, and sensing application [32].\n202 G.-M.

      "text" : "Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a process in which an electric field is applied to a stable colloidal suspension in between two electrodes [38, 39]. As shown in Fig. 12.5a, two distinct processes are involved: (i) charged particles in the colloid move toward the electrode of opposite polarity to that of the particles’ surface charge (electrophoresis) and (ii) a solid deposit is formed by coagulation at the suspension-electrode interface (deposition) [38]. This technique can be used to prepare dense, void-free ceramic structures ranging from thin coatings to bulk layers\n12 MXene Films, Coatings, and Bulk Processing 203\nseveral centimeters thick [40]. EPD has been used for commercial-scale production of various ceramics [40–42] and making nanocomposite films of 2D materials [43, 44] because of the flexibility and scalability of the deposition apparatus (e.g., power sources and size/shape of the deposition electrodes and the cell, Fig. 12.5b), fast deposition rates, and the excellent microstructural control compared to other processing methods [38]. Collini et al. [38] successfully fabricated freestanding Ti3C2Tx films by EPD from both water-based (aqueous) and propylene carbonatebased (nonaqueous) colloidal Ti3C2Tx suspensions. It was found that increasing the deposition voltage led to the formation of pores and less-oriented structures in films made from aqueous suspensions (Fig. 12.5c), while the overall film morphology was quite insensitive in the case of the propylene carbonate depositions (Fig. 12.5d) [38]. At the optimal voltage of 5 volts, the samples fabricated in both cases showed very tightly stacked surface (Fig. 12.5e–f), and the kinetics of deposition can be modeled according to the following Eqs. (12.1) and (12.2) [40]:\nω(t) = ωo ( 1 − e−kt )\n(12.1)\nk = Af u V\n(12.2)\nwhere ω is the mass (mg), t is the deposition time (s), ωo is the total available dispersed mass in suspension (mg), k accounts for the current decrease due to the resistance of the forming deposit, A is the electrode surface area (m2), f is the efficiency of the process (f ≤ 1), u is the average velocity of the particles (m/s), and V is the volume of the suspension used (m3).\nIn addition to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes [38], MXene films can be formed on various conductive substrates (e.g., nickel foam electrode) [45] to lead to versatile films for different applications. Therefore, EPD can be used as a fast and high-throughput method for making MXene films."

      "heading" : "Dipping Layer-by-Layer Assembly",
      "text" : "Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is the process of building a film by sequentially coating a substrate in polyelectrolytes of opposite charge [46]. Electrostatic attractions between polymers in solution cause a thin layer of material to deposit after each coating step. Additionally, if there are materials dispersed in the polyelectrolyte solutions, then the material will deposit in the polymer layer, forming a uniform composite. One method of LbL assembly is dip coating (dip-LbL), in which the substrate is coated by sequential dipping into the polyelectrolyte solutions (Fig. 12.6a, b). Dip-LbL has been widely utilized to make high-quality thin films [48–50] for a variety of applications. Due to the hydrophilicity [4] and large negative zeta potential [51] of MXenes, it is possible to form an aqueous dispersion of MXenes\n204 G.-M. Weng et al.\nin a polycationic solution, so that they may be used as a composite material in a multilayer thin film. A few points should be considered when using dip-LbL to prepare MXene films: (i) be sure the MXene dispersion in the polyelectrolyte solution is stable and uniform (e.g., in poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and low-pH poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solutions, Ti3C2 dispersions have shown to be unstable) and has (ii) sufficient drying time between dips to prevent irregular deposition of polyelectrolyte and (iii) proper gas drying near the bottom of the substrate to remove the droplet that forms due to gravity. Recently, Lipton et al. [52] successfully prepared several kinds of MXene-based LbL films. We illustrate an example of MXene-CNT composite film (Fig. 12.6c). The final MXene films (onto substrates like glass slide and silicon wafer) can be easily delaminated by immersing into hydrofluoric acid (HF) [49]. These films can then be characterized for its electronic, mechanical, and electromagnetic interference shielding properties. The flexibility of dip-LbL allows the use of many different combinations of materials in MXene composites."

      "text" : "In traditional dip-coating LbL, the film stays in contact with the polyelectrolyte solutions and rinsing fluids long enough to achieve a thermodynamic equilibrium at each stage [50, 53]. Taylor’s TMD group pioneered an automated spin spray layerby-layer (SSLbL) film assembly apparatus which employs sub-second spray times to produce LbL quality films with cycle times one order of magnitude shorter than those previously reported [47, 54]. As illustrated in Fig. 12.7a, the SSLbL involves alternately spraying polyelectrolyte solutions (i.e., positively charged and negatively charged polyelectrolytes) onto a rotating substrate (e.g., glass slide, Si wafer, or polyester film) such that electrostatic interactions and simultaneous drying results in tunable ultrathin films. The SSLbL approach is advantageous in comparison to dip\n12 MXene Films, Coatings, and Bulk Processing 205\ncoating because the polyelectrolyte assembly is not limited by diffusion processes. Recently, Weng et al. [55] successfully prepared the LbL MXene-CNT composite films (Fig. 12.7b–d) using SSLbL assembly, and these LbL films showed high conductivity up to 130 S cm−1. To our best knowledge, this is the highest value achieved among LbL composite films to date. Moreover, these MXene-MWCNT films showed outstanding EMI shielding effectiveness. With this technique, various layer-by-layer MXene-based composite films can be developed and could lead to improved performance in mechanical strength, EMI shielding, and energy storage."

We note that these processes do not require electricity, as seen previously in EHDA and EPD (Sections “Electrohydrodynamic Atomization” and “Electrophoretic Deposition”), and rely more heavily on the chemical properties and interactions between the layering materials and the hosting substrate [56]. Typically MXene flakes are on the order of 1-nm-thick and several microns in the lateral size, depending on the delamination process [57–59]. Stable colloidal solutions of layered MXenes can be realized using appropriate solvents (described previously), and the resulting films can be obtained using nontoxic, low-cost, and solution-based processing [60]. In the next section, we will focus on using various coating techniques to obtain transparent conductive MXene thin films with good morphology that can be used as conductive electrodes for next-generation electronic devices [12, 57, 58, 61].\n206 G.-M.

      "heading" : "Spin Coating",
      "text" : "Spin coating is the most known technique for producing thin films from liquid solutions. The basic working principle is depicted in Fig. 12.8a. Briefly, the desired material solution is made (colloidal or dissolved), and the substrate is wetted using the ink or droplet of the desired solution (step 1). The substrate is then rotated (step 2) and most of the solution flies off. The remaining solvent evaporates (step 3) leaving the desired molecules/material behind (step 4). Both the centripetal force and the surface tension help to obtain an even coverage of material forming a thin film [56]. In the case of the MXenes, the starting solution contains colloids of delaminated flakes (Fig. 12.8b). The thickness of the formed film can be easily controlled by changing the spin speed (Fig. 12.8c) and the concentration of the starting solution [12, 57, 62]. Such precise control allows for monitoring the amount of MXene flakes deposited on the substrates that leads to obtaining highly conductive and transparent films. A good representation of the films obtained using the Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx species of MXenes is summarized in Table 12.2. We also compared in this table the optoelectronic properties of other conductive 2D materials, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Since the sheet resistance of thin conducting films is directly related to the transparency, a metric that enables one to quantify their quality is a figure of merit (FOM) of the ratio of the direct conductivity (σ dc) to the optical conductivity (σ oc). The higher this ratio (σ dc/σ oc), the better the film optoelectronic properties [66]. This FOM is related to both the sheet resistance (Rsh) and transparency (T) by the Eq. (12.3):\n12 MXene Films, Coatings, and Bulk Processing 207\nwhere μ0 is the vacuum permeability and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. A comparison of optoelectronic properties of different 2D conductive materials is shown in Table 12.2. The spin-coated MXene films with high transparency (~80%) show ~5 times and ~50 times higher conductivity than rGO and MoS2, respectively. These promising results show that after only 3 years of their discovery, high conductive transparent electrodes have been fabricated; and in just 1 year, these FOM [57] have been doubled. As discussed in Chap. 25, grain boundaries of these delaminated MXene flakes play a significant role in forming a continuous network and lead to such high conductivity. It has been reported that the contact issue significantly limits the device performance of 2D electronics and requires a 2D material as electrodes to achieve ohmic contacts [67]. The highly conductive and transparent MXene films can be used as electrical contacts and reduce the contact resistance, to benefit the performance of short-channel field-effect transistors for 2D nanoelectronic devices [67] and open a path for future development for electronic applications. A more detailed discussion on transparent conductive MXene films can be found in Chap. 25 of this book."

They described how the resulting films showed a remarkable electromechanical stability, upon a small bending radius where the sheet resistance only increased by about 15% and recovered back when removing the mechanical stress [58]."

This technique is also well established for large area coverage, and a summary of the steps is depicted in Fig. 12.11a. Basically, the substrate is immersed into the desired solution (step 1), and it is slowly removed from it at a constant velocity (step 2). In the meniscus between the substrate and solution, the solvent slowly dries and the material packs by self-assembly (steps 3 and 4). Controlling the velocity and the solution concentration is important using this technique as this will have a direct impact on the film thicknesses (step 5) [69].\nAn interesting property of this method is the conformality that can be achieved. Ultrathin MXene flakes can keep the shape of a rough substrate and form a scaffold, as shown in Fig. 12.11b [61].

The suitable polymers (should be water-soluble, hydrogen bond forming, and positively charged) can be easily processed into mixed solution and provide MXene with effective interaction, as discussed previously in section “Vacuum-Assisted Filtration”. Besides, Hao et al.

Here, polymer fillers are polyethylenimine (PEI) and\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and the mixed solution was cast onto a support layer of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration membrane.

Typically, the hybrid films were folded to five times and rolled for six times. The as-prepared flexible films can be used as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase films for metallic lithium and lead to controlled growth of lithium dendrites in the nanoscaled gaps [74]. This method can be further generalized to fabricate graphene-metallic lithium films and boron nitride-metallic lithium films [74]. Currently, MXene-based electrodes for supercapacitors and batteries are mostly prepared in a slurry-cast way [75] like the preparation of that for lithium-ion batteries.

Sun et al. reported the synthesis of MXene@polystyrene hybrid particle via electrostatic interaction and preparation of a bulk MXene@polystyrene sample with compression molding in which high pressure of 500 MPa was applied (Fig. 12.14) [76]. It is found that the compression molding at room temperature delivers a brittle MXene@polystyrene composite sample due to many gaps and voids that could not be removed. This is because the polystyrene microspheres are rigid when the molding temperature is below their glass transition temperature. To solve this issue, higher temperature like 130 ◦C could be used to enable viscoelastic deformation of the polystyrene during the compression molding. Depending on the application of the composite sample, moderate amounts of binder or lubricant additive (e.g., paraffin wax [77]) can be used to further reduce the pressing pressure and the operating temperature.\n12 MXene Films, Coatings, and Bulk Processing 213"

The choice of method for MXene processing depends on the specific application of interest, and each method has its pros and cons, as reviewed in this chapter.

Not surprisingly, most of the reviewed methods are mature and have also been applied to process CNTs, graphene, and other functional materials [27, 83]. However, each MXene processing method still needs to be perfected towards more efficient, lower-cost, reproducible, and higher-quality. In addition, new emerging processing technologies or methods such as 3D printing [13] and computer numerical control (CNC) deposition [84] could be used to precisely “engineer” MXene composite material in the near future.

      "text" : "Since the discovery of the graphene, two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained momentum due to their unique physical, chemical, mechanical, electrochemical, and electronic properties [1]. Many 2D materials can be exfoliated into single atomic layers with large exposed surface areas which make them potential candidate for the next-generation flexible electronic, optoelectronic, and electrochemical devices [2, 3]. The family of 2D material is rich in compositions and offers a wide spectrum of properties (e.g., metals, semiconductors, and insulators) [4]. Recently, a variety of 2D materials have been explored including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), germanene, borophene, silicene, and black phosphene, among others [4]. 2D materials have been synthesized by a variety of methods, such as mechanical cleavage exfoliation, liquid-phase exfoliation, chemical/physical vapor deposition, wet chemistry, electrochemical metal ion intercalation and exfoliation, and many other methods [5].\nIn addition to unique properties of exfoliated 2D materials compared to their bulk counterpart, 2D geometry offers exceptional compatibility with the host materials which allow to manufacture 2D heterostructures with desired properties [6]. While 2D materials offer tremendous potential, scalability and reliable synthesis of 2D materials still pose a challenge [6]. It is worth noting that majority of the reported 2D heterostructures are inorganic in nature [3, 5], and less attention has been paid to the organic materials. Organic materials are abundant, metal-free, scalable, flexible, lightweight, and their properties can be tuned using established organic chemistry principles [7]. By knowing the target application, organic molecules\nM. Boota ( ) A. J.

Boota\ncan be synthesized with tunable chemical, electronic, electrochemical, and optical properties [8]. A plethora of organic materials is available having potential for electrochemical energy storage (e.g., carbonyls), donor/acceptor organics for photovoltaics (e.g., dyes), and photosensitive (e.g., azo-molecules), electrochromic (e.g., conducting polymers [CPs]), biomedical (organic gels), and many more applications [9, 10].\nFrom application standpoint, both organic and inorganic materials have pros and cons. Imagine an example of quinones for electrochemical energy storage applications. Theoretically, quinone molecules have high capacitance/capacity due to their highly reversible proton-coupled redox, yet they are insulator and dissolve into electrolyte during electrochemical operation; therefore, their performance deteriorates after a few hundred cycles [11]. On the other hand, if they are engineered on a conductive inorganic support, the issue of poor conductivity and solubility can be significantly reduced [12]. Consider another example of poorly conducting polystyrene for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding [13]. Pristine polystyrene showed negligible EMI shielding effectiveness; however, when coupled with 7% carbon nanotubes, the EMI shielding effectiveness was increased to 18.2–19.3 dB over a frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz, which was attributed to the formation of conducting network in the polystyrene matrix [13]. These examples clearly motivate us to find the pathways to couple conductive inorganic materials with organics, which will provide a sheer number of combinations to achieve the desired properties in a device. Organic–inorganic hybrid materials have already shown a great promise for the purpose of manufacturing high-performance materials for a broad range of applications such as electrochemical energy conversion and storage, catalysis, water purification, drug delivery, electronics, photonics, textiles, and others [14]. Molecular-level combination of two best suited components in a hybrid material leads to new or sometimes exceptional sets of physical, chemical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties that makes them attractive for broad ranges of applications [15]. The desired properties of the resulting hybrid materials can further be altered by tuning the chemical compositions, molecular-level interactions/interfaces, morphologies, and shapes.\nIn 2011, a new family of 2D inorganic materials called MXene was discovered— now one of the fastest growing families in 2D materials world [16]. Since the discovery of the first MXene (titanium carbide, Ti3C2Tx), about 20 different MXenes have been synthesized, and dozens more are theoretically predicted [17]. MXenes are transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides which are synthesized by selectively etching the A element layers from ternary transition metal carbides and/or nitrides with a general formula of Mn + 1AXn (M = an early transition metal, e.g., Ti, V, Mo, Sc, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, etc.; A = group 13 and 14 element; X = C/N; and n = 1, 2, or 3) [18, 19]. Wet chemical etching of A layer always yields surface terminations (e.g., —OH, —O, and/or —F); therefore, the general formula for the MXenes can be written as Mn + 1XnTx [20]. As opposed to other 2D materials, MXenes have a unique set of properties [21] such as metallic conductivity (∼6000–8000 S/cm), hydrophilicity, and structural diversity, enabling\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 223\ntheir use in various applications such as supercapacitors, EMI shielding, batteries, sensors, water purification, catalysis, antibacterial films, transparent conductive electrodes, and many others [16].\nMXene family is a rising star in the 2D material world. Since most of the “low-hanging MXene fruits” have already been reaped [16], it is now time to explore the MXene–organic hybrids. Indeed, the field of MXene–organic hybrids is quite new, yet it is expected that organic functionalization on MXenes can dramatically improve their performance due to synergistic contributions from each component of the hybrid. MXenes offer a unique platform to the organics because of their metallic conductivity and high aspect ratio [22]. Integration of MXenes with organic molecules and polymers is an attractive pathway to manufacture functional hybrid materials with tunable physical, chemical, electronic, mechanical, and electrochemical properties [23, 24]. The broad diversity of organic molecules and availability of over 20 different MXenes with different properties offer tremendous potential to expand the research horizons of MXene–organic hybrids. MXene–organic hybrids of desired morphologies, shapes, and properties can be synthesized by rationally selecting the MXene and organic component within a hybrid."

Unlike synthesis of other 2D organic hybrids where many synthetic routes are available (e.g., wet chemical synthesis, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, spin-coating, etc.) [6], synthesis routes for MXene–organic hybrids are yet limited. The properties of the MXene–organic hybrids are largely governed by the nature of interactions between interacting moieties. These interactions can be van der Waals (vdW) or covalent interactions [25]. Unlike other 2D materials, MXenes offer unique chemical reactivity in aqueous media which can be effectively utilized to manufacture robust functional hybrid materials [24]. Synthesis of MXene–organic hybrids can be divided into three categories (Scheme 13.1): (1) oxidant-free polymerization of monomers into polymers, (2) self-assembly of organic molecules and polymers, and (3) covalent functionalization. In the following discussion, we have also included our computational results to explain the host–guest interaction mechanisms, charge transfer mechanisms, and propagation of monomers into polymers.

      "heading" : "Oxidant-Free Polymerization",
      "text" : "The state-of-the-art synthesis of conducting polymer (CP) hybrids involves the addition of the monomer to the acidic solution of an oxidant in the presence of a host material where deposition of the CPs is needed (e.g., graphene, MoS2, etc.) [26, 27]. This process is called chemical oxidant polymerization [28]. While this synthesis process is in practice since the discovery of the CPs and widely explored by researchers around the world [29], it has several limitations when we want to use this method for the synthesis of organic–inorganic hybrid materials: (1) use of oxidants leads to uncontrolled polymerization, resulting in agglomerated CPs deposited on a host material. Consequently, the accessibility of ions and electrons to the bulk becomes slower; thus, maximum benefit of the hybrids remains unattainable. (2) Oxidants are hazardous agents in the synthesis and add extra cost to the synthesis. As opposed to other 2D materials [30], when we use titanium carbide (MXene) as a host material, both issues can be solved to a large extent [31]. For instance, titanium carbide offers metallic conductivity in slightly acidic aqueous media, and it can serve as an oxidant as well as offers conductive slit-shaped ion diffusion channels for rapid ionic and electronic transport [23]. In addition, its 2D morphology offers confined channels to CPs that will allow better control on polymerization process [23, 31]. The functional groups on MXene surface further serve as the interacting sites, enabling robust interaction between MXene and the CP monomers [25].\nLet us discuss the synthesis of pyrrole on MXene surface [23]. Pyrrole is a five-membered ring and belongs to heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds with chemical formula C4H4NH [32]. Pyrrole can be polymerized into polypyrrole (PPy) using a variety of oxidants such as iron chloride, potassium permanganate, and others [32]. Figure 13.1a displays a schematic of synthesis of polypyrrole on MXene\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 225\nby simple mixing of appropriate amounts of MXene with pyrrole. In a typical synthesis process, a solution of delaminated Ti3C2Tx (d-Ti3C2Tx) suspension of known concentration was mixed with pyrrole in two different mass to volume ratios, 2:1 and 1:1, of d-Ti3C2Tx/pyrrole to manufacture PPy–Ti3C2Tx hybrid. Vigorous stirring is usually needed to avoid agglomeration of the polypyrrole during polymerization process. After stirring, the thick black suspension was obtained that was vacuum filtered to obtain a brittle PPy–Ti3C2Tx hybrid film having thickness of ~13 μm and areal mass loading of 0.93 mg/cm2. The low-magnification crosssectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. 13.1b) shows that the hybrid film is composed of well-aligned stacked MXene sheets in which polypyrrole chains are likely confined.\nThe FTIR bands (Fig. 13.1c) in PPy–Ti3C2Tx hybrid film at 2116 and 1735 cm−1 are ascribed to C—N and carbonyl stretching, respectively. The bands at 1219 and 911 cm−1 are due to stretching vibrations of the doped polypyrrole chains. The\n226 M. Boota\nband at 838 cm−1 is ascribed to the C—H vibrations inside the pyrrole ring [33]. Raman bands (Fig. 13.1d) at 938, 1085, and 1261 cm−1 are associated with the formation of dications (bipolaron). The band at 985 cm−1 is ascribed to radical cation (polaron) structure within hybrid [34]. Raman bands at 616, 712, 1042, 1320, and 1590 cm−1 are assigned to the pyrrole ring torsion, C–H wagging, C– H deformation, C–C in-ring and inter-ring stretching, and C=C stretching of two oxidized structures, respectively [34, 35]. These results confirmed that pyrrole is polymerized on Ti3C2Tx MXene without using any oxidant.\nCross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the PPy– Ti3C2Tx hybrid film (Fig. 13.1e) showed that PPy chains are periodically aligned between MXene sheets. As opposed to conventional oxidant polymerization [26], MXene-induced polymerization produced hybrid film in which polymer chains were aligned instead of agglomerating. Here, MXene served as a hard template as well as a conductive substrate for the alignment and synthesis of the PPy chains. It was earlier reported that hydrogen bonding is the key interaction which assists alignment of the PPy chains. Generally, monomers of CPs incline toward random aggregation during polymerization; however, they tend to self-align if hydrogen bonding is present within interacting moieties of the hybrid [36, 37]. In the PPy–Ti3C2Tx hybrid, the hydrogen bonding-assisted alignment of PPy chains stems from the hydrogen bonding interaction between terminating oxygen or fluorine present on the Ti3C2Tx surface and N–H group of the pyrrole ring. In addition, ordered oligomer chains favored 2D growth of PPy within MXene sheets rather than randomly [29, 36]. Such ordered morphologies are highly desired where rapid ion and electron percolation is needed [38, 39]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the pristine Ti3C2Tx and the PPy–Ti3C2Tx (1:2) exhibited identical XRD pattern in the range of 20–35◦; however, a clear downshift in the (0002) peak from ~6.4◦ to ~3.6◦ was noted for the hybrid film. This confirmed that PPy chains were intercalated between MXene layers and expanded the interlayer spacing from 13.8 to 24 Å (Fig. 13.1f). It is important to mention that pure PPy is amorphous and therefore shows a very broad diffraction peak at ~25◦, corresponding to the scattering from PPy chains [40].\nMostly, synthesis of CPs involves balanced mixing of a monomer and an oxidizing agent (e.g., K2Cr2O7, FeCl3, KMnO4, CuCl2, etc.) in an acidic media [41, 42]. However, it has been reported earlier that elements of halogen family can act as both oxidizing and chemical polymerization agents [43, 44]. For example, Kang et al. used halogens (e.g., iodine, bromine, and chlorine) for simultaneous oxidation and polymerization of pyrrole into PPy [43, 44]. The polymerization of pyrrole has also been reported via protonation of pyrrole [45]. Since Ti3C2Tx has an acidic character, its interaction with pyrrole resulted in protonated molecule, which then interacts with the unprotonated pyrrole to generate a dimer. The process continues to form longer PPy chains which become conductive via fluorine doping from MXene [41, 43, 44, 46]. The proposed mechanism for this polymerization is shown in Fig. 13.1g [32, 47]. MXene films are flexible [24]; however, PPy–Ti3C2Tx appeared brittle after polymerization. This further suggested the formation of low molecular weight PPy that hindered sliding of MXene sheets [24]. There are other possible\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 227\nexplanations; however, one theoretically supported mechanism of the spontaneous polymerization without the addition of any oxidant is discussed in the forthcoming section.\nMechanism of MXene Induced Self-Polymerization of CPs: A Case of PEDOT–Ti3C2Tx\nWith the help of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we tried to identify the mechanism of MXene-induced polymerization in the absence of oxidants [31]. We demonstrated this on a different monomer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) which serves as a backbone for the synthesis of a wide variety of π -conjugated polymers with tailored optical, electronic, and electrochemical properties [48]. Freestanding films of PEDOT–MXene were produced using a similar method that was used for the polymerization of pyrrole.\nTo experimentally confirm the MXene-induced polymerization of EDOT without an oxidant, we used Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. Raman spectra of pristine Ti3C2Tx, conventionally synthesized PEDOT, and the hybrid structure are shown in Fig. 13.2a. The PEDOT–MXene hybrid film exhibited a combined character of conventional PEDOT and Ti3C2Tx, confirming remarkable potential of MXene to polymerize monomers in the absence of oxidants. This is in sharp contrast to other 2D materials, where excessive amounts of oxidants are needed to initiate the polymerization which often leads to agglomeration on 2D sheets [30]. The bands at 1541 and 1451 cm−1 were ascribed to vibrations of thiophene ring, and C=C symmetric vibrations. It has been reported that 1451 cm−1 peak can be associated with the degree of oxidation in the PEDOT structure. Since the 1451 cm−1 peak appeared less intense compared to conventionally synthesized PEDOT, it was confirmed that EDOT is less oxidized using MXene compared to other strong oxidants, however sufficient enough to produce doped PEDOT chains [49, 50]. The bands at 1268, 1146, 998, 854, 713, 574, and 436 cm−1 are attributed to the C–C stretching, quinoid ring vibration, oxyethylene ring deformation, C–O bending vibrations, symmetric C–S–C deformation, and C–O–C bond deformation, respectively, confirming the polymerization of the doped PEDOT [51–53]. The Raman results clearly confirmed that EDOT interacted and polymerized on MXene surface [18]. FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 13.2b) further corroborated the Raman results. The typical vibrations of the thiophene ring (C–S band) were observed at 990, 854, and 692 cm−1 [54]. The stretching vibrations of the C–O–C bond in the ethylene dioxy group were seen at 1149 and 1080 cm−1. The ones at 1643 and 1361 cm−1 were assigned to the C–C and C=C stretching vibrations of the thiophene ring [31]. Furthermore, the existence of the C=C stretching bands agrees to the conjugated network of the PEDOT, also endorsing doped (conductive) PEDOT [55, 56]. Both Raman and FTIR spectroscopic results confirmed that EDOT has been polymerized on/between the Ti3C2Tx layers. Once EDOT polymerization was confirmed by experimental means, further mechanism was supported by the DFT calculations [31].\n228 M. Boota\nAs a first step, we determined the adsorption of the EDOT on the Ti3C2O2 in five different configurations (orientations: pI–III, parallel; vI–II, vertical). The following formula was used to determine the binding energies (BE) of EDOT on the surface of Ti3C2O2:\nEBE = EMXene+EDOT − (EMXene + EEDOT) ,\nwhere EBE is the total binding energy (BE), EMXene + EDOT is the total energy of EDOT adsorbed on the surface of Ti3C2O2, EMXene is the total energy of Ti3C2O2, and EEDOT is the total energy of the EDOT monomer. Based on the BE values, it became clear that EDOT preferably adsorb on MXene surface in parallel configuration, which was confirmed by the lowest BE values of the pI configuration (−1.02 eV). The fact that other configurations showing higher BE values confirmed that they are not preferred configurations for the EDOT adsorption during polymerization (Fig. 13.2c). Charge density of the most stable configuration (pI) was further calculated. It was found that the π electrons of EDOT were partially transferred to the Ti3C2O2 surface, while the rest were transferred to C-2p or O2p orbits (Fig. 13.2d) [31]. This electron exchange was further measured by using\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 229\nBader analysis [57], and we found that there were 0.34 electrons transferred from EDOT to Ti3C2O2. This electron transfer occurred due to higher Fermi energy level aligned to the vacuum energy level of EDOT at −4.31 eV compared to Ti3C2O2 at −6.24 eV (Fig. 13.2d).\nThe effect of charge transfer on EDOT polymerization on the surface of Ti3C2O2 was determined by calculating the energy cost for polymerization, while different electrons are lost from EDOT (Fig. 13.2e). The following relationship was used to calculate the average energy cost for polymerization (y):\ny = (EPEDOT + 2nEH-nEEDOT) /n,\nwhere EPEDOT, n, EEDOT, and EH parameters are the total energy of PEDOT with nx being electron loss, number of EDOT in one PEDOT unit, total energy with x electron loss, and total energy of H atoms, respectively. The fitted linear relationship between energy cost and electron loss is y = −7.19x + 4.93 (Fig. 13.2e). It can be seen that energy cost for polymerization was decreased with the electron loss from EDOT. In other words, the higher energy level leads to electron transfer from EDOT to MXenes, resulting in a facile polymerization of EDOT to PEDOT on MXene surface for formation of the Ti3C2Tx–PEDOT hybrid structure [31].\nBased on our above discussion on facile in-situ polymerization, it can be concluded that two factors are needed to complete this polymerization using MXene’s local chemistry: (1) charge transfer must happen between the MXene and CP monomer, and (2) as the polymerization reaction proceeds, energy cost for polymerization ε decreases with the progress of charge loss from monomer e until the reaction barriers are conquered. Thus, two reaction pathways are possible as shown in Fig. 13.2f. In case of type I reaction pathway, electrons will transfer from the monomer to the substrate ( e) when the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the monomer (EDOT) are higher than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the substrate (MXene). This potentially results in the polymerization if its energy cost decreases with electron transfer, just as EDOT on the MXene surface. For type II reaction pathway, the reverse may happen to complete the polymerization. For instance, polymerization reaction may also occur if its energy cost decreases with electrons transferring from the substrate (MXene) to the monomer (EDOT) (− e), since the HOMO of the substrate is higher than the LUMO of the monomer. Based on these rules, many MXene–polymer hybrids can be synthesized without using any oxidant for a broad range of applications."

[61] produced Ti3C2Tx–PPy hybrids using pyrrole as a monomer and ammonium persulfate as an oxidant in an acidic media. While there are reports on polymerizing CP monomers on MXene surface using oxidants, care should be taken since MXene solution tends to oxidize upon addition of the oxidants."

      "heading" : "Self-Assembly of Organic Molecules and Polymers",
      "text" : "Molecular self-assembly on 2D solids is an established approach to manufacture functional hybrid materials for a variety of applications [14]. Hybrid structures formed via self-assembly method are driven by the complex molecular interactions between organic functionalities and 2D solids [62]. These interactions are usually weak physical interactions, namely, as π–π stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions [63]. Molecular self-assembly of organics on 2D materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and transition metal dichalcogenides can be different due to varying nature of chemistries [5]. Unlike other 2D materials, MXene flakes are hydrophilic and offer a highly negative zeta potential in the range of −30 to −80 mV [21]. These features facilitate the processing of MXene with organic molecules/polymers in aqueous media compared to other 2D materials where usually surfactants or other organic molecules are needed to stabilize the suspensions [64].\nLing et al. [24] pioneered manufacturing of first conductive, flexible, and freestanding MXene–polymer hybrid film. The hybrid films were made by simple mixing of Ti3C2Tx MXene with either a charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) or an electrically neutral polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce Ti3C2Tx–polymer hybrids. The resulting suspensions were vacuum filtered through a polypropylene separator membrane to yield flexible hybrid films. The polymers were self-assembled between MXene layers due to high negative zeta potential and opposing charges on polymers especially on a cationic PDDA polymer. The fact that (0002) peaks shifted toward lower angles in XRD patterns of both hybrids suggested that polymer chains were intercalated between MXene sheets. It was shown that the thickness, conductivity, and flexibility of the hybrid films can be tuned in a range from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers by simply altering the starting amount of the polymer within hybrid.\nUsing a similar concept, Hyosung et al. [65] recently produced MXene– polyelectrolyte hybrids using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method (Fig. 13.3a). They have used positively charged polyelectrolyte called poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDAC) due to +18 mV zeta potential. As MXene offers highly\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 231\nnegative zeta potential, self-assembly of PDAC and MXene was expected. To accomplish this task, Ti3C2Tx MXene multilayers were first deposited by alternate immersion (Fig. 13.3b) or by spraying (Fig. 13.3c) of the Ti3C2Tx MXene and PDAC. As the number of MXene layers was increased, the color of the films became darker (Fig. 13.3b, c). Interestingly, when PDAC was removed from the coating process, and only Ti3C2Tx MXene film deposition was attempted, it did not work. This confirmed that electrostatic interactions between organic and Ti3C2Tx are needed for the robust MXene–organic hybrids. The structure and morphology of the hybrid films were examined by cross-sectional SEM of the hybrid film which showed nacre-like brick-and-mortar cross section, and moreover, surface was covered with the dense Ti3C2Tx nanosheets having a thickness of 378 ± 33 nm (for 40 layers). The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra exhibited broad absorption peaks at 770 nm which agrees to Ti3C2Tx sheets. As the number of the layers was increased, the absorption at 770 nm increased linearly, which is consistent with the linear increase in film thickness (Fig. 13.3 e–g). Given that the thickness of MXene\n232 M. Boota\nsheet is ~1 nm and that the thickness of the coated polymer is negligible, then each deposit step adsorbed ten layers of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. The profilometry was used to measure the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness which appeared <40 nm (Fig. 13.1g). Using similar approach, many MXene–organic conductive coatings can be explored in the future. Zehang et al. [66] also used LbL method to produce freestanding, flexible, and conductive hybrid films composed of Ti3C2Tx (MXene), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber networks. Initially, negatively charged MXene aqueous suspension was spray coated on oppositely charged MWCNT suspension on a polyethyleneimine-functionalized PCL film. This combination exhibited open network architecture since MWCNTs served as the spacer which prevented MXene sheet restacking, and highly porous nature of PCL assisted to enhance the surface area of the hybrid which is much needed for fluid transport through membranes.\nWhile selecting a target polymer, another critical parameter to consider is the solubility of the polymer. It is important to mention that the solubility of the MXene and a target polymer in the same solvent is a crucial step to manufacture robust MXene–polymer hybrids. As MXenes have high negative zeta potential in neutral and basic solutions upon delamination, they give stable colloidal suspensions. Naguib et al. [67] investigated polyacrylamide (PAM) as a potential candidate for hybridization with MXene. PAM has many industrial applications such as in paper industry, wastewater treatment, and soil conditioner, among others. Since PAM potentially can form hydrogen bond as well as is a water-soluble polymer, it potentially can be a good candidate to hybridize with MXene. To prepare Ti3C2Tx– PAM hybrid, different mass ratios of Ti3C2Tx to PAM were mixed. The hybrid solution was then mixed to get the Ti3C2Tx–PAM hybrid films. Using XRD, it was noticed that the intensity of the Ti3C2Tx (0002) peak around 9◦ 2θ was reduced. This confirmed that Ti3C2Tx flakes are disordered or well dispersed in the PAM matrix, which is in contrast to previously reported MXene–PVA or PDDA systems. When 6 wt% of PAM was used as the initial mass, large quantities of PAM were intercalated between MXene layers, enabling their separation. When the PAM content was reduced, the intercalation of PAM appeared every 3–8 layers. This was not sufficient enough to delaminate multilayer Ti3C2Tx to nanosheets. Therefore, large amount of multilayer MXene was available in 31% hybrid film. From this analysis, it was concluded that intercalation of PAM between MXene layers is a multistaged process, like intercalation of organic compounds into graphite. Elisa et al. [68] electrospun a range of polymers, namely, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), polyethylene oxide (PEO), PVA, and alginate/PEO with Ti3C2Tx MXene. While polymer content in these hybrid fibers was low (1% w/w), it significantly impacted the viscosity, conductivity, and crystallinity of the polymers.\nWhile a variety of organic molecules and polymers were combined with the MXene, the interaction mechanism of polymers and MXene was not clear. We systematically investigated the interaction of conjugated polymers (polyfluorene derivatives [PFDs]) with layers of 2D Ti3C2Tx [69]. Three derivatives with polar, nonpolar, and charged nitrogen-containing functionalities were synthesized using Suzuki polycondensation reaction. We synthesized polyfluorene derivatives P1\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 233\n[poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene), poly({9,9′-bis[3′′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl]-2,7fluorene}-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))], P2 [poly({9,9′-bis[3′′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl]-2,7-fluorene}-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene))], and P3 [poly([2,7(9,9′-dioctyl)fluorene]-alt-{2,7-[9,9′-bis(5′′-trimethylammonium bromide)pentyl] fluorene})] with different lateral chain functionalities. These pre-synthesized polymers were combined with the Ti3C2Tx MXene to manufacture PFD–Ti3C2Tx hybrids (Fig. 13.4a).\nWhen we compared the XRD patterns of all the hybrids, it became clear that intercalation of polymers between Ti3C2Tx MXene is end-group dependent. The largest downshift in c-lattice parameter (c-LP) was noticed for the P3@Ti3C2Tx, a nitrogen bearing charged polymer (7.23◦ for Ti3C2Tx to 5.34◦ for P3@Ti3C2Tx). The shift in the c-LP was associated with the end-group polarity. For instance, P1 neither had nitrogen end group nor the charged ends, so the change in the c-LP was lowest as opposed to P3. The cross-sectional SEM image of the P3@Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 13.4c, top left) displayed aligned Ti3C2Tx layers in which P3 is likely confined. TEM image (Fig. 13.4c, top right) of P3@Ti3C2Tx showed that P3 chains are confined and aligned between Ti3C2Tx layers. It was concluded that the self-assembly of this hybrid became possible because of electrostatic interactions\n234 M. Boota\nbetween positively charged lateral chain functionalities of P3 and negatively charged Ti3C2Tx MXene.\nTo further strengthen this argument, fluorescence microscopy images were taken on P2- (Fig. 13.4c, bottom left) and P3-containing (Fig. 13.4c, bottom right) hybrid films. The top view micrographs clearly show the existence of segregated fluorescent clusters (P2) on a black background (MXene) in P2@Ti3C2Tx; however, in P3@Ti3C2Tx, the fluorescent emission is diffused more homogenously on the entire MXene surface. FTIR spectra of the P3@Ti3C2Tx film (Fig. 13.4d) exhibited strong blue shifts from 1150 to 1550 cm−1. Importantly, the large shifts were associated with the cationic ends of the P3 polymer, confirming that the cationic end of the P3 polymer plays a decisive role in interaction with the Ti3C2Tx surface. Raman spectroscopy was conducted on all hybrids. It appeared that P3@Ti3C2Tx showed strong signatures of both Ti3C2Tx and P3, which displayed the presence of large amount of P3 between the layers or on the surface. All peaks of the P3@Ti3C2Tx were broadened (Fig. 13.4e), confirming P3 polymer interaction via the charged ends and confinement between the Ti3C2Tx MXene layers, consistent with earlier reports on polyaniline, polyamide, and other polymerclay hybrids [70–72]. Therefore, both FTIR and Raman spectra corroborated that the charged nitrogen-containing functionalities may be responsible for the interaction of polymers with Ti3C2Tx. A strong shift toward a lower binding energy (BE) in the Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of P3@Ti3C2Tx further confirmed the bonding of the nitrogen species to an electron donor (MXene). This study concluded that polar polymers with charged nitrogen-containing groups preferably interact with the Ti3C2Tx layers, as shown by an increase in interlayer spacing and large shifts in spectroscopic peaks (Fig. 13.4)."

      "text" : "There are two synthesis methods reported so far which utilized covalent functionalization approach: (1) spontaneous functionalization of organics and (2) diazonium coupling. Hongbing et al. [73, 74] functionalized Ti3C2Tx using diazonium chemistry. First, multilayered Ti3C2Tx powder was mixed with sodium chloride to prepare pre-intercalated Ti3C2Tx. The solution was centrifuged, and sediment was washed with DI water to further functionalize it. The grafting of phenylsulfonic groups was achieved by mixing the sodium intercalated Ti3C2Tx suspensions with sulfanilic acid, hydrochloric acid, and sodium nitrite. The resulting mixture was washed with water, methanol, dimethylformamide, and acetone to eliminate salts, impurities, and loosely attached species. Our group has recently shown that amino acid such as glycine self-functionalize on Ti3C2Tx surface [25]. We first used DFT calculations to predict the most stable configuration of glycine on Ti3C2O2 MXene surface. It appeared that the glycine molecules were aligned in parallel to Ti3C2O2 (MXene) surface with largest BE of −0.75 eV. Shared electrons between Ti and N atoms suggested the formation of a Ti–N bond between glycine and Ti3C2O2,\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 235\nwhich was also confirmed by the XPS analysis. We calculated interlayer spacing of glycine–Ti3C2Tx hybrid by XRD and found that hybrid film exhibited 1.22 Å larger spacing compared to pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene, which agreed with our theoretical predictions. This demonstration clearly suggests exploring more organic molecules which can covalently attached to MXene by simple mixing as opposed to other 2D materials where tedious synthesis protocols are needed for functionalization of organic molecules."

Boota\ncapacitance of Ti3C2Tx MXene (528 Fcm−3, 2 mVs−1, KOH electrolyte). Heng et al. [75] prepared Ti3C2Tx–ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) hybrid by mixing modified Ti3C2Tx MXene solution with the UHMWPE. The mixture was then molded on a press vulcanizer which automatically controlled temperature, pressure, cooling, and spread out into a 150 × 150 × 4 mm3 squareshaped mold. The mixture was warmed up to 220 ◦C under 10 MPa, followed by cooling and cutting into different shapes for characterizations. Crystallinity, surface hardness, mechanical properties, creep resistance, and antifriction properties of the hybrid films appeared improved. Ti3C2Tx–PAM (polyacrylamide) hybrid was manufactured by simple mixing of PAM with Ti3C2Tx MXene, resulting in a very promising dispersion of MXene nanoflakes. Moreover, a high conductivity of 3.3 × 10−2 Sm−1 was achieved for 6 wt% (1.7 vol%) MXene-containing film [67].\nYong et al. [76] manufactured poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)–Ti3C2Tx hybrids by solution blending and compression molding method. Regardless of the starting PVDF amount (1–5 wt%) used in the hybrid, the thermal conductivity of the hybrid appeared improved when compared to pristine Ti3C2Tx film. A maximum thermal conductivity of 0.363 W mK−1 was achieved when PVDF loading was 5 wt%, which is onefold higher compared to neat PVDF. Not only thermal properties, but 5 wt% hybrid also showed a storage modulus as high as ~7500 MPa that is 64% higher compared with that of pristine PVDF. Ziyin et al. [77] produced poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO)–Ti3C2Tx hybrid using solution blending method. Various compositions were prepared by changing the content of the Ti3C2Tx in the hybrid (0–5 wt%). Wide-angle XRD confirmed that crystalline structure of the PEO is not changed and Ti3C2Tx layers are exfoliated. By using non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization study, it was confirmed that with the addition of the Ti3C2Tx, crystallization rates first increased and then decreased. The fastest crystallization rates were noticed when 0.5 wt% Ti3C2Tx content was used in the hybrid. This observation was ascribed to the competition of the two phenomena named nucleation and confinement effect of the 2D filler. When Ti3C2Tx loading is lower, the filler enhances PEO crystallization because of heterogeneous nucleation, and when Ti3C2Tx loading is higher, the filler offers rigid confinement network, which reduces the crystallization. When Ti3C2Tx content was ~5 wt%, the crystallization of PEO was increased again due to lower confinement effect.\nRiu et al. [78] investigated the thermal properties of the Ti3C2Tx–PVA hybrid by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and polarized-laser power-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Their results showed that inclusion of PVA to MXene enhanced the thermal stability of Ti3C2Tx by reducing the thermal coefficient of the Eg1 mode from −0.06271 to −0.03357 cm−1 K−1. This was ascribed to the formation of the Ti–O bonds between Ti3C2Tx and PVA polymer, confirmed by the XPS results. In addition, the thermal conductivities of Ti3C2Tx–PVA hybrid and pristine Ti3C2Tx were found to be 47.6 and 55.8 W/(m−1K−1), respectively. Xinxin et al. [79] investigated the impact of MXene on crystallization and thermal\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 239\ndegradation kinetics linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). It appeared that the addition of only 2% of Ti3C2Tx MXene in the hybrid can accelerate the crystallization rate and thermal stability.\nFiltration/Membranes/Coatings Runlin et al. [80] prepared the Ti3C2Tx–PES hybrid at 0.2 MPa on a polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membrane via a simple filtration method. When the Ti3C2Tx content was increased in the Ti3C2Tx–PES hybrid film, it showed high rejection to dyes and inorganic salts. Importantly, hybrid membranes exhibited good flux (115 Lm−2 h−1) and high rejection to Congo red dye (92.3% at 0.1 MPa). At flux above 432 Lm−2 h−1 (0.1 MPa), the hybrid film rejected inorganic salts below 23%, confirming the potential use of MXene-containing hybrid membranes in water treatment and dye desalination. Xiaoli et al. [81] prepared two different types of MXene–polymer hybrid membranes for solvent-resistant nanofiltration technology. They selected hydrophilic polyethyleneimine (PEI) and hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to combine them with Ti3C2Tx MXene, where the former offers an excellent solvent resistance and good mechanical/chemical properties and later is promising for the organic solvents that mostly contain weak or nonpolar solvents. Six commonly used solvents, namely, ethanol, isopropanol, butanone, ethyl acetate, toluene, and n-heptane, were selected to assess solvent-resistant ability and nanofiltration performances of as-produced hybrid membranes. Large lateral size of Ti3C2Tx MXene provided interaction platform to the polymer chains, restricting the chain movement of the polymers. Consequently, hybrid films exhibited enhanced structural stability and solvent resistance. The hydroxyl groups present on Ti3C2Tx surface played a crucial role to transport alcohol molecules. In this way, PEIand PDMS-containing membranes showed 30% and 162% higher alcohol flux, respectively. PDMS-containing membrane showed better performance because weak interactions between PDMS and Ti3C2Tx permits more —OH groups to work as active sites for the alcohol molecules. When nanofiltration performance of both membranes was compared, it appeared that PEI-containing membrane is good for dealing with polar solvents and PDMS-containing membrane is good for the nonpolar solvents. Moreover, the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets effectively blocked the transfer of large-sized polyethylene glycol oligomers which helped to improve the rejection capability of both PEI- and PDMS-containing membranes. Lan et al. [82] modified the surface of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to prepare solvent-specific MXene-based membranes. Four different types of functional groups, namely, —COOR, —NH2, —C6H6, and —C12H26, were grafted onto pristine Ti3C2Tx with the aid of organofunctional siloxanes. The aim of this effort was to provide carrier sites and boost the molecular transport along the Ti3C2Tx surface. It turned out that functionalization of Ti3C2Tx–NH2, Ti3C2Tx–COOR, Ti3C2Tx–C6H6, and Ti3C2Tx–C12H26 led to major flux improvement ratio for isopropanol, ethyl acetate, toluene, and n-heptane, respectively. By embedding functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene into PEI, PDMS improved the rejection ability of membranes by extending transport pathways of solute molecules. These results suggest that incorporation of\n240 M. Boota\nTi3C2Tx MXene into PEI and PDMS polymers may be a universal strategy for the nanofiltration of the alcohol-based filtration processes.\nZhi et al. [83] produced hybrid of Ti3C2Tx with chitosan (CS) to fabricate Ti3C2Tx–CS membrane on porous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) substrate using spincoating process for solvent dehydration via pervaporation process. Three different types of organic solvents, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl carbonate, were used to investigate the membrane dehydration performance. It appeared that combination of Ti3C2Tx MXene did not enhance the surface sorption; however, the presence of Ti3C2Tx MXene improved the permeation of water molecules throughout the membrane. Consequently, separation factor and flux of CS membrane were enhanced due to the presence of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. Particularly, Ti3C2Tx–CS membrane showed total flux of ~1.4–1.5 kgm−2 h−1 and separation factor of 1421, 4898, and 906 for dehydration of ethanol, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl carbonate at 50 ◦C, respectively [83]. This shows the potential of MXene to manufacture membranes for solvent dehydration.\nJiakui et al. [84] functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene sulfonated polyelectrolyte brushes (Ti3C2Tx–SO3H) through a facile surface-initiated precipitationpolymerization. The functionalized MXene is then used to manufacture hybrid proton exchange membranes with basic CS and acidic sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) as polymer matrixes. It appeared that Ti3C2Tx–SO3H sheets provided efficient proton transport pathways and linked the conduction channels in polymer phase. Consequently, proton conduction in the hybrid membranes boosted under both hydrated condition and anhydrous condition. More importantly, the incorporation of only 10 wt% Ti3C2Tx–SO3H gave 144% and 66% improvement in proton conductivity to SPEEK membrane and CS membrane under hydrated condition, respectively. In addition, the mechanical and thermal properties of both membranes were improved.\nElectromagnetic Interference (EMI) Shielding Hybrid materials are also attractive for EMI shielding applications [13]. While pristine Ti3C2Tx have shown extraordinary EMI shielding properties [85], search for the new hybrid materials with high conductivity and minimum amount of MXene is still ongoing [86]. For example, Faisal et al. [85] first reported nacre-like Ti3C2Tx–sodium alginate (SA) hybrid film (Ti3C2Tx–SA) which exhibited excellent EMI shielding performance. The thickness of the hybrid film was kept between 8 and 9 μm while studying different compositions of the hybrid. It appeared that EMI shielding efficiency increased with increasing the Ti3C2Tx loading and reached to a maximum of 57 dB for the 90 wt% Ti3C2Tx–SA composition. It was concluded that instead of reflection, absorption was the leading mechanism for EMI shielding in Ti3C2Tx–SA hybrids.\nRenhui et al. [86] manufactured highly conductive Ti3C2Tx–polystyrene (PS) hybrid using electrostatic interaction principle (Fig. 13.6a). The positively charged PS spheres were prepared with cationic dimethylamino methacrylate methylchloride (DMC) as a stabilizer which exhibited zeta potential in the range of 33 (pH = 11.3) and 69 (pH = 2.7) mV (Fig. 13.6b). On the other hand, Ti3C2Tx synthesized in\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 241\ntheir study showed zeta potential of −25 (pH = 3.0) to −54 mV (pH = 11.3). A simple mixing of two varying zeta potential materials led to the formation of robust hybrid via electrostatic interactions. The resultant hybrid showed low percolation threshold of 0.26 vol% and excellent conductivity of 1081 Sm−1. The EMI shielding performance of >54 dB was noted over the whole X-band with a maximum of 62 dB at the low Ti3C2Tx loading of 1.90 vol%. Not only had this but Ti3C2Tx– PS hybrid also exhibited improved storage modulus, 54% higher than those of pristine PS. Yuan et al. [61] produced Ti3C2Tx–PPy hybrid by oxidative chemical polymerization. It was noticed that 25 wt% Ti3C2Tx–PPy hybrids in a paraffin matrix demonstrated a minimum reflection loss of −49.2 dB and maximum effective absorption bandwidth of 5.7 GHz. The enhanced EMI performance was attributed to the conductive network, dipolar, and interfacial polarizations.\nEnergy Storage Polypyrrole (PPy) is known for its pseudocapacitance, flexibility, and intrinsic conductivity [87]. For the first time, we prepared [23] PPy–Ti3C2Tx hybrid in the absence of any oxidant which exhibited volumetric capacitance of ∼1000 Fcm−3 and high capacitance retention of 92% after 25,000 charge/discharge cycles. Chi et al. [31] produced PEDOT–Ti3C2Tx hybrids by oxidant-free polymerization of the EDOT on surface of Ti3C2Tx layers by simple mixing of the aqueous suspensions of EDOT and Ti3C2Tx MXene. The as-produced PEDOT–Ti3C2Tx hybrid showed a reversible capacity of ∼300 mAhg−1 with excellent capacity retention and rate performance, outperforming its pristine counterparts. In another study [25], we have shown that glycine molecules can covalently attach to Ti3C2Tx via Ti–N bonding, which also expanded the interlayer spacing of the Ti3C2Tx sheets.\n242 M. Boota\nStrong interactions between glycine molecules and expanded MXene layers gave an easier path for ion mobility, enabling high rate performance of the hybrid electrodes. At a scan rate of 10 mVs−1, the capacitance of the hybrid electrodes reached to 324 Fg−1 and lost 60% of capacitance after high rate of 1 Vs−1, twice the value of pristine Ti3C2Tx film. Not only high rate performance but the hybrid electrodes also showed excellent stability for more than 20,000 charge/discharge cycles. The improved capacitance, rate performance, and cycle life were ascribed to enhance interlayer spacing and stronger interaction between glycine molecules and Ti3C2Tx MXene (Fig. 13.7).\nMinshen et al. [88] used PPy chains to intercalate between Ti3C2Tx sheets to improve the capacitance and cycling stability of the PPy [88]. The capacitance of the as-produced Ti3C2Tx–PPy improved from 150 (300) to 203 mFcm−2 (406 Fcm−3), and hybrid showed 100% capacitance retention after 20,000 charge/discharge cycles. This was ascribed to the fact that Ti3C2Tx prevented dense PPy stacking between/on the sheets; therefore, electrolyte infiltration was facile during charging/discharging. Another factor which contributed to boost the cycling stability was the strong bonding between PPy backbones and surface functional groups of Ti3C2Tx, resulting in improved conductivity and better stability of the hybrid during electrochemical operation. The hybrid was further tested in an ultrathin allsolid-state supercapacitor which exhibited an excellent capacitance of 35 mFcm−2, and stable electrochemical performance at any bending state, and during 10,000\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 243\ncharging/discharging cycles [88]. Hongbing et al. [73, 74] functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene with phenylsulfonic groups derived from in-situ-generated diazonium ions by the corresponding amine. Aryl groups were attached to MXene sheets in the form of strong MXene-aryl (Ti–O–C) linkages. MXene sheets with grafted electroactive groups gave twice high capacitance compared to their pristine counterpart due to electroactive aryl groups. The hybrid electrodes also showed high capacitance retention of 91% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. This study clearly highlighted the importance of covalent functionalization MXenes with other electroactive organic molecules.\nYingying et al. [60] produced Ti3C2Tx–PANI hybrid via oxidative chemical polymerization. The as-produced hybrids were tested as a supercapacitor electrode in a three-electrode configuration. The electrolyte used was 1 M Na2SO4 and the tested voltage window was −0.8 V to −0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl. The hybrid electrodes showed a maximum capacitance of 164 Fg−1 at 2 mV/s and 96% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. The improved performance was ascribed to the pseudocapacitive contributions of the PANI molecules. Leiqiang et al. [89] used a recently reported Mo1.33C MXene to prepare hybrids with commercially available PEDOT- or PSS-based solution. The Mo1.33C–PEDOT/PSS hybrid film was used to prepare flexible solid-state supercapacitor device which showed a maximum capacitance of 568 Fcm−3, an energy density of 33.2 mWhcm−3, and a power density of 19,470 mWcm−3. The Mo1.33C–PEDOT/PSS hybrid film electrodes exhibited high volumetric capacitance of 1310 Fcm−3 and remarkable rate performance and high cycle life. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the Mo1.33C–PEDOT/PSS hybrid film was attributed to the increased interlayer spacing (easier ion and electron mobility), high redox capacitance of CP, and electrode architecture. This strategy clearly provides an avenue to explore watersoluble CPs to manufacture CP–MXene hybrids for energy conversion and storage applications.\nXiao et al. [59] produced PANI@TiO2–Ti3C2Tx ternary hybrid using hydrothermal method via in situ polymerization process. The hierarchical hybrid showed high capacitance of 188.3 Fg−1 (10 mVs−1), which is twice higher than that of TiO2–Ti3C2Tx and 435.4 Fcm−2 at 0.5 A g−1 in KOH solution. Also, the hybrid showed good capacitance retention of 94% after 8000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 Ag−1. The improved performance was due to the hierarchical architecture and the synergistic impact of combining PANI nanoflakes within TiO2–Ti3C2Tx hybrid. Zhongxing et al. [58] prepared mono- and co-doped Ti3C2Tx–PEDOT hybrids by oxidative chemical polymerization. The fabricated hybrids showed lamellar microstructure, which facilitated the transport of ions and electrons to boost the capacitance. When Ti3C2Tx–PEDOT hybrid co-doped with 1,5-naphthalene disulfonic acid/H3PMo12O40 was compared with the one co-doped with 1,5-naphthalene disulfonic acid/anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS), it became clear that the latter can provide higher capacitance due faradic contributions from the AQS.\nCatalysis Li et al. [90] used Ti3C2Tx as a conductive support to deposit 2D metalorganic framework (MOF), namely, cobalt 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (CoBDC), via\n244 M. Boota\nan interdiffusion reaction-assisted process [90]. The idea was to utilize Ti3C2Tx MXene as a conductive support to improve the electron mobility to improve the catalytic activities of the hybrid. The resulting Ti3C2Tx–(CoBDC) hybrid was used in oxygen evolution reaction. It turned out that hybrid achieved a current density of 10 mAcm−2 (1.64 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) and a Tafel slope of 48.2 mVdec−1 in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming state-of-the-art transition metal-based catalysts. This hybrid provided synergistic impact to boost the catalytic properties where CoBDC gave high surface area and hydrophilic Ti3C2Tx nanosheets provided rapid charge percolation across Ti3C2Tx − CoBDC interface, which overall eased the transport of aqueous electrolyte to majority of catalytically active sites. Asproduced hybrid electrodes were further used as an air electrode for a rechargeable zinc–air battery. The hybrid electrodes were able to power a light-emitting diode, confirming large potential of MXene-based hybrids in catalysis and air batteries. This study provided a starting point to the researches to hybridize a large family of MOFs with 2D MXenes.\nBiomedical Applications Gongyuan et al. [91] produced modified Ti3C2Tx and tested them for tumor targeting photothermal/photodynamic/chemo-synergistic therapy. By taking advantage of negatively charged surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene, they hybridized doxorubicin (DOX) as the chemotherapy agent and hyaluronic acid as the active tumor targeting agent with Ti3C2Tx nanosheets through layer-by-layer adsorption. The resulting hybrid exhibited improved biocompatibility, stimuliresponsive drug release, tumor-specific accumulation, and excellent tumor ablation efficacy at a low dose (Ti3C2Tx at 2 mg kg−1 with DOX loaded at 1.6 mg kg−1) under a low power density of NIR laser (808 nm, 0.8 Wcm−2). This study pointed out the potential of the MXene for the biomedical applications and cancer therapy. Han et al. [92] combined Ti3C2Tx MXene with the soybean phospholipid (SP) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to study the impact of organic–inorganic hybrid as photothermal agent for cancer therapy. In another study, Han et al. [93] used Nb2C nanosheets to combine them with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to produce Nb2C − PVP for photothermal tumor eradication. After hybridization with PVP, the Nb2C − PVP suspension showed outstanding biocompatibility and physiological stability without obvious toxicity in vitro/in vivo.\nSensors Jing et al. [94] developed a unique strategy to graft vanadium carbide (V2C) MXene with poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) brushes via self-initiated photografting and photopolymerization (SIPGP) method. Since PDMAEMA offers CO2 and temperature dual-responsive properties, this hybrid was used as a smart system for tuning the dispersion state, transmittance, and conductivity of V2C suspension. This report for the first time showed that V2C–PDMAEMA hybrid can experience hydrophobic–hydrophilic transitions in aqueous media. This demonstration opened the direction to manufacture smartresponsive MXene–polymer hybrids using other types of MXenes. Hyosung et al. [65] produced strain sensors to topographically sense objects or materials deformation using a patterned MXene multilayer-coated PET film (Fig. 13.8a) which deformed and bent when small objects passed through the scanner. As a\n13 MXene–Organic Hybrid Materials 245\nresult, change in normalized resistance R/R0 occurred (Fig. 13.8a, b). The asmanufactured scanner even detected complex shapes such as T, A, M, and U letters (Fig. 13.8d, e). Next, MXene-coated PDMS was used to fabricate a soft human motion sensor which detected the angle of a bent index finger with little hysteresis (Fig. 13.8f, g). A large gauge factor (GF) of 11.5 (GF, the sensitivity to bending) was noticed when the bending angle was increased to 35◦; in comparison, most metalfoil gauges have a gauge factor of 2.0 (5% maximum strain) [65]. Nevertheless, MXene offers significant potential for organic hybrids in organic electronics and sensors.\n246 M. Boota"

      "heading" : "Summary and Outlook",
      "text" : "We have summarized the majority of the exciting work in which MXenes were combined with the organic molecules and polymers to manufacture MXene–organic hybrids. Unlike the majority of the 2D solids, MXenes offered unique properties of hydrophilicity, metallic conductivity, and structural diversity, enabling their use for numerous applications. We have also provided a fundamental understanding of interactions between MXenes and organics, including charge transfer-induced polymerizations, electrostatic self-assembly, and covalent interactions. Furthermore, we used computational results to identify host–guest interaction, charge transfer mechanisms, and propagation of monomers to polymers. We also explained the role of polarity in organic molecules/polymers which will guide the design of new organic–inorganic hybrid materials with well-defined properties for a variety of applications. Later, we have provided a detailed discussion on recent applications of MXene–organic hybrids for a broad range of applications and charted them in Table 13.1. We believe that the field of MXene–organic hybrids will progress swiftly in the coming years. While progress in this field is exciting, there are several challenges which need to be explored in detail:\n1. MXenes offer reactive surface chemistry. It is necessary to find ways to control the surface chemistry of MXenes. Approaches to produce MXenes with uniform functional groups are critically needed. This will allow to rationally tune the MXene–organic interfaces/interactions. 2. Novel in-situ characterization techniques/methods are needed to understand the electron and ion transport mechanisms in a single molecule/MXene interfaces. 3. More diverse synthesis methods need to be explored for the synthesis of MXene– organic hybrids. It is necessary to develop strategies in which molecular selfassembly could be controlled at nanoscale. 4. Most of the reported studies have focused on the Ti3C2Tx MXene to combine them with organic molecules. Considering the diversity of MXene family, the combination of other MXene members with organics needs to be explored. 5. There is a large opportunity to further explore MXene–organic devices at molecular level. 6. More computational efforts are needed to guide the synthesis of MXene–organic hybrids in the future."

      "text" : "MAX phases are a large family of solid layered transition metal carbides or nitrides with a hexagonal lattice (space group P 63/mmc) and the chemical formula Mn+1AXn, where “M” stands for an early transition metal (Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, or Mo), “A” represents an element from the groups III–VI of the periodic table (Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, As, Bi, S, or Te), “X” is carbon or nitrogen, and n = 1–4 [1–5]. Recently, the family of crystalline MAX phases has been expanded even further. For example, a set of ordered double transition metal MAX phases of M2M′AX2, M2M′2AX3 [6, 7], and (M2/3M′1/3)2AX2 has been synthesized [8, 9],\nM.

Khazaei et al.\nwhere “M′” is another transition metal. The crystal structures of MAX phases with varying stoichiometry are shown schematically in Fig. 14.1. To the best of our knowledge, 82 different crystalline MAX phases have been experimentally fabricated [1, 3]. In addition to the crystalline MAX phases, various alloys of MAX phases with different mixtures of transition metals and/or X elements have also been synthesized. Theoretically, thousands of crystalline or alloy structures of MAX phases have been predicted to be stable [10–20].\nUp to a few years ago, the applications of MAX phases were based solely on their interesting mechanical properties, rather than their electronic, magnetic, or optical properties. However, the possibility of exfoliation from MAX phases into two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides or nitrides, the so-called MXenes, has significantly broadened the range of potential applications of MAX phases [21, 22]. It has been repeatedly proved experimentally that by using the combination of acid treatment and sonication, the M−A bonds in some of the MAX phases can be broken, whereas the M−X bonds remain almost intact. After the exfoliation process, the A atoms are washed out from the MAX phase, and the remaining set of single or multilayers is MXene. The crystal structures of derived 2D MXenes, M2X, M3X2, M4X3, M5X4 M2M′X2, and M2M′2X3, are\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 257\nshown schematically in Fig. 14.2. So far, the single or multilayer 2D structures of Ti2C [22], Ti2N [23], V2C [24], Nb2C [24], Mo2C [25], Ti3C2 [21], Zr3C2 [26], Nb4C3, [27] Ta4C3 [22], and Ti4N3 [28] as well as TiNbC [22], (Ti0.5Nb0.5)2C [22], (V0.5Cr0.5)3C2 [22], Ti3CN [22], Mo2TiC2 [29], Mo2ScC2 [7], Cr2TiC2 [29], Mo2Ti2C3, [29] (Nb0.8Ti0.2)4C3 [30], and (Nb0.8Zr0.2)4C3 [30] have already been synthesized. The electronic properties of these 2D MXenes are different from those of their corresponding MAX phases. It is also shown theoretically that upon a particular surface functionalization, some of the MXenes turn into semiconductors [31]. In contrast to the limited applications of MAX phases as structural materials, many interesting electronic [31–37], optical [38], mechanical [39], magnetic [31, 40–44], thermoelectric [31, 32], photocatalytic [45], and many other applications [46, 47] have been theoretically proposed for 2D MXenes. Experimentally, MXenes have attracted a lot of attention in the materials science community for electronic transport [48–50], energy storage [51, 52], energy conversion [53–56], and development of novel hybrid nanocomposites [57, 58]. There are comprehensive reviews on the synthesis and application [59] and the current theoretical status [60] of MXenes in the literature.\nIt is now well accepted that the MAX phases are a great source for producing novel 2D systems. Considering the compositional varieties of the MAX phases, a large number of 2D MXenes with novel properties are expected to become available. Therefore, the important questions to be answered at this moment are the followoing: which of the MAX phases are promising candidates for successful exfoliation into 2D materials and what will be the electronic properties and applications of the derived MXenes? In the following, we address the above two main questions."

      "heading" : "Computational Methods",
      "text" : "Before discussing the properties and/or applications of MAX phases and MXenes, it is worth summarizing briefly the computational methods employed in the most\n258 M. Khazaei et al.\nrecent theoretical studies. Among the different methods, density functional theory (DFT) has proved to be a reliable method of predicting various physical and chemical phenomena in atomic scale. Hence, DFT calculations are performed to examine many properties and applications of MAX phases and MXenes. However, it is known that the simple DFT method may fail to predict the values of band gap and van der Waals interaction and the properties of strongly correlated materials. For instance, the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional [61], which is most often used in this book chapter, underestimates the band gap. Because of the approximate nature of the DFT-based methods [62], this book chapter mainly focuses on the general trends expected in the physics and chemistry of MAX phases and MXenes, rather than emphasizing quantitatively the exact values of various properties. In the following, the DFT-PBE method is employed for the theoretical studies, unless otherwise stated.\nInsight into Possibility of Exfoliation of MAX Phases into 2D MXenes\nHere, we would like to address the question that which MAX phases are promising candidates for successful exfoliation into 2D MXenes. Theoretically, on the basis of analysis of tensile and shear stresses, the mechanical exfoliation of various M2AlC (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W) MAX phases into 2D M2C MXenes has been investigated [63]. There, it was found that by applying a large tensile strain, all the interlayer M−Al bonds can be broken, leading to separation between the M2C and Al layers [63]. However, the chemical exfoliation process is a very complicated dynamical process, which is very difficult to model and simulate with all the details. Nevertheless, we can still gain valuable insights by studying the bond strength and the exfoliation energy because MAX phases with weaker M−A bonds are expected to show promise for a successful exfoliation process. Moreover, we examine the effect of charge injection on the bond strength of the MAX phases for facilitating the exfoliation process."

      "heading" : "Bond Strength",
      "text" : "Currently, static calculations are considered as the only straightforward way to provide useful information on the possibility of exfoliation. In this regard, force constants, integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP), bond order, and exfoliation energies are important quantities that can provide quantitative measures of the bond strength and the ease of exfoliation [64]. In order to keep this book\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 259\nchapter short, the results of integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) and bond order are not discussed here. They can be found in Ref. [64].\nIn order to evaluate the force constants of the bonds in the MAX phases, we perform a set of phonon calculations on the 82 experimentally observed crystalline MAX phases. The force constants are estimated from the phonon calculations [65]. A force constant can be calculated from the second derivative of the total energy with respect to the finite displacements of atoms i and j along the x, y, and z directions and is a 3×3 matrix, given as one of the output results of the phonon calculations. Because the trace of the force constant matrix is independent of the coordinate system, i.e., invariant under a coordinate rotation [66, 67], we consider the trace of the force constant matrix and refer to this scalar quantity as the force constant Fij between atoms i and j in the main text [67].\nHere, M1 and M2 represent transition metals belonging to the first and second layers of transition metals close to the A element, and the X layer is sandwiched between the M1 and M2 layers (see Fig. 14.1). In the M2AX, M3AX2, M4AX3, and M5AX4 MAX phases, the transition metals of M1 and M2 are of the same type, whereas in the M2M′AX2 and M2M′2AX3 MAX phases, M1 and M2 are of different types. The results of the force constants for these bonds are summarized in Fig. 14.3. A general trend can be discerned: shorter bonds are stiffer. It is also observed that the force constants of the M1−X bonds are significantly larger than those of the other bonds. This indicates that the M1−X bonds are the strongest in the MAX phases, which is the main reason for the stability of these MAX phases and the resulting MXenes. Becasue the force constants of the M1−A bonds are smaller than\n260 M. Khazaei et al.\nthose of the M1−X bonds, the M1−A bonds are weaker than the M1−X bonds. The X−X and A−A bonds are the weakest among all the bonds, as can be observed in Fig. 14.3 [64].\nIn order to examine which of the MAX phases are well suited for successful exfoliation into 2D MXenes, the total force constant FCA (the summation of all the force constants connected to the A element) is a very useful quantity. As a simple criterion, we can expect that MAX phases with a smaller FCA can be considered as promising candidates for the exfoliation process. In this respect, Ti2AlC, V2AlC, Ti3AlC2, Zr3AlC2, Ti4AlN3, Nb4AlC3, Mo2TiAlC2, Cr2TiAlC2, Mo2ScAlC2, and Mo2Ti2AlC3 are the MAX phases that have already been exfoliated into Ti2C, V2C, Ti3C2, Zr3C2, Ti4N3, Nb4C3, Mo2TiC2, Cr2TiC2, Mo2ScC2, and Mo2Ti2C3, respectively. All these compounds contain Al in the MAX phases. Our analysis indicates that the minimum (maximum) FCA is for Zr3AlC2 (V2AlC). Therefore, we expect that by using appropriate acids in the experiments, it might be possible to break bonds as strong as the V−Al bond. On the basis of this criterion, we can screen our data for compounds with an FCA less than 21.855 eV/Å2 [64].\nThe exfoliation process can be said to be successful experimentally only if the obtained 2D MXenes are structurally perfect. This requires the M1−M2 and M1−X bonds to be stronger than the M1−A and A−A bonds. Otherwise, during the exfoliation process, other bonds may also be broken in addition to the M1−A bonds. In such a case, either the MXenes would not be formed at all or they would be formed with many M and X defects. Because the M1−X bonds are strongest in the MAX phases, we calculate the total force constant FCX (the summation of all force constants connected to the X element) for the MAX phases experimentally exfoliated into MXenes. We find that the maximum (minimum) FCX is obtained for V2AlC (Zr3AlC2). Therefore, in order to successfully synthesize MXenes, FCX should at least be as large as that for Zr3AlC2 (40.511 eV/Å2). On the basis of this criterion, we rescreen the results of FCX in all the MAX phases [64].\nAs described above, chemical exfoliation is a complicated dynamical process involving subtle details. Hence, it is extremely difficult to simulate such processes computationally. However, calculation of the static exfoliation energy would help us screen MAX phases for successful exfoliation into 2D MXenes. Here, we evaluate the exfoliation energy EExfoliation for the 82 different MAX phases. The static exfoliation energy EExfoliation of a bulk MAX phase into 2D MXenes is calculated through EExfoliation = −[Etot(MAX phase) − 2 Etot(MXene) − 2 Etot(A)]/(4S), where Etot(MAX phase), Etot(MXene), and Etot(A) denote the total energies of the bulk MAX phase, 2D MXene, and A element, respectively [64]. Here, S = √3a2/2 is the surface area, and a is the lattice parameter of the MAX phase. Exfoliating a MAX phase, each unit cell of the MAX phase generates two MXene layers with four surfaces in all. This explains why the exfoliation energy is divided by 4 in the above formula.\nFrom our exfoliation energy analysis, it is seen that among the MAX phases experimentally exfoliated into MXenes, Zr3AlC2 (V2AlC2) shows the lowest (largest) EExfoliation (eV/area), 0.131 (0.205) eV/Å2. Therefore, we expect that the MAX phases with an exfoliation energy lower than 0.205 eV/Å2 have a better\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 261\nchance of being exfoliated into MXenes. Figure 14.4 shows a plot of the total force constant FCA for the A atoms versus the exfoliation energy. It is clear that the total force constant FCA is strongly correlated with the exfoliation energy: the MAX phases with smaller FCA have a lower exfoliation energy [64].\nCombining all the above bond analyses, we can finally conclude that the best candidates among MAX phases for successful exfoliation into 2D MXenes are those MAX phases with small total force constants of the A atoms, large total force constants of the M and X atoms, and a low exfoliation energy. We predict that in addition to the 10 MAX phases that have already been exfoliated experimentally, the following 37 MAX phases are promising candidates for the successful exfoliation. Because the exfoliation energy is more directly related to the chemical exfoliation process than to the other two criteria, we prioritize this criterion to sort these 37 promising candidates from the smallest to the largest exfoliation energies [64]. Therefore, in the following list, we predict that the first (last) MAX phase is the most (least) promising candidate for successful exfoliation: (1) Ti2CdC, (2) Zr2AlC, (3) Ti3AuC2, (4) Ti5AlC4, (5) Zr2InC, (6) Hf2AlC, (7) Ti2GaC, (8) Ti4GaC3, (9) Hf2InC, (10) Nb5AlC4, (11) Hf2TlC, (12) Ti2InC, (13) Ti2TlC, (14) Nb2GaC, (15) Hf2PbC, (16) Ta5AlC4, (17) Ti3SiC2, (18) Ti4SiC3, (19) Ti3GeC2, (20) Nb2InC, (21) Ti2GeC, (22) Ti4GeC3, (23) Hf2SnC, (24) Mo2GaC, (25) Ti2SiC, (26) Ta2GaC, (27) Cr2GaN, (28) Ti3IrC2, (29) V2GaC, (30) Ti2InN, (31) Ta2AlC2, (32) Ti2PbC, (33) Ta2AlC, (34) Cr2GaC, (35) V4AlC3, (36) V3AlC2, and (37) Ti2SnC [64]."

      "text" : "In order to investigate the effects of electron (hole) injection to the MAX phases, here we add (remove) 2, 3, 4, and 5 electrons per unit cell to (from) M2AX, M3AX2, M4AX3, and M5AX4, respectively, by changing the total number of\n262 M. Khazaei et al.\nvalence electrons. The number of injected charges is chosen such that the number of injected charges per atom in all the studied MAX phases is the same. We employ Bader charge analysis [68–70] to estimate the number of electrons on each atom in the neutral and charged MAX phases.\nWe have investigated the relative number of electrons or holes received by the M, A, and X atoms in the charged MAX phases with respect to the neutral phases. Interestingly, in both positively and negatively charged MAX phases, most of the charges are received by the transition metals [64]. That suggests that the states close to the Fermi energy must be transition-metal-centered. In order to explore this observation, we calculate the electronic structure of the charged and neutral MAX phases. Typical results for the projected density of states (PDOS) for charged and neutral Zr2TlC and Hf2SC are shown in Fig. 14.5. It is found that in all the neutral MAX phases, the states near the Fermi energy are dominated by d orbitals of the transition metals, as anticipated already [64]. Hence, the electrons or holes injected into the MAX phases are mainly received by the transition metals. Among Zr2TlC and Hf2SC, Hf atoms in Hf2SC receive a larger number of electrons or holes as compared with Zr atoms in Zr2TlC. This is because in Hf2SC the states below and above the Fermi energy are almost wholly contributed by the d orbitals of Hf, whereas in the case of Zr2TlC, in addition to the d orbitals of Zr, there is a contribution from the d orbitals of Tl near the Fermi energy [64].\nIn addition, we have also investigated the effect of charge injection on the bonds. It is found that in the positively (negatively) charged MAX phases, the bond lengths of both M1−A and M1−X bonds decrease (increase). Injecting electrons (holes) increases (decreases) the number of electrons on the M, A, or X atoms, which results in a longer (shorter) bond length [64]. Interestingly, the impact of the charge injection on the M1−A bonds is generally more significant than that on the M1−X bonds. When the transition metals receive a sufficient amount of electrons, the M1−A bonds expand and may break completely. Indeed, we find that in negatively charged Cr2GeC, V2GeC, Ti3SnC2, V4AlC3, and Cr2TiAlC2, the M1−A bond length increase is so large that the A atoms are completely detached from the transition metals [64].\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 263\nIn order to understand clearly the effect of charge injection on the structural properties, thicker MAX phases such as Ti5AlC4 and Nb5AlC4 are preferable to thinner phases. This is because the thinner MAX phases become unstable with only a few injected electrons [64]. Although Ti5AlC4 and Nb5AlC4 have not been synthesized as phase-pure ternary compounds yet, their solid solutions (Ti0.5Nb0.5)5AlC4 already exist experimentally [71]. Figure 14.6 summarizes the results for the bond lengths and the corresponding force constants and the lattice constants, when 1–5 electrons or holes per unit cell are injected into Ti5AlC4. As shown in Fig. 14.6a, upon the electron (hole) injection, all bond lengths tend to increase (decrease), and the change in bond length is larger when the amount of injected charge is larger. It is also clearly observed that the Ti1−Al bond is most sensitive to the charge injection. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 14.6b, the force constants increase (decrease) with the hole (electron) injection. This occurs because the positive charge injected on either of the atoms in the bond would increase the electronegativity and decrease the bond length, thus increasing the ionic contribution to the force constant [64]. Note also in Fig. 14.6b that after injecting a certain amount of electrons, the force constant of the Ti1−Al bond becomes very small. This implies that if a larger amount of electrons is injected, the A atom (i.e., Al) becomes detached from the transition metal Ti.\nWe also investigate in Fig. 14.6c the effect of charge injection on the a and c lattice parameters of Ti5AlC4. As expected, the strongest effect occurs in the c lattice constant because the Ti1−Al bonds are oriented almost parallel to the c axis. In particular, the electron injection induces a large swelling along the c axis in Ti5AlC4 and also in other MAX phases in general. This implies that the exfoliation process becomes easier for the negatively charged MAX phases than for the neutral case because the M1−A bonds become longer and weaker upon receiving electrons [64]. The exfoliation of charged MAX phases might be achieved experimentally through charge-controlled electrochemical swelling techniques [72–82]. Volume swelling can also be produced using irradiation methods by controlling the density of intrinsic point defects [83]."

In the previous section, we have shown that this might be possible because in some MAX phases, the bonding between elements A and M is weaker than that between elements M and X. Experimentally it has been suggested that the outer layers are often saturated with F, O, and/or OH groups when HF acid solutions are used to eliminate the A element [84–88]. The process of exfoliating Ti3AlC2 into Ti3C2 has been theoretically studied in the presence of water and HF acid using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations [89, 90]. There, it is shown that the spontaneous dissociation of HF and subsequent termination with H\n264 M. Khazaei et al.\nor F at the edge of the Ti atoms weakens the Al−M bonding, consequently opening the interlayer gap. The further insertion of HF is facilitated through the interlayer gap.

Becasue the coordination number of a transition metal ion is often six, it is natural to assume that the transition metals in MXenes form six chemical bonds with the neighboring X atoms and the attached chemical groups on the surfaces, resulting in the formation of M2XF2, M2X(OH)2, and M2XO2 [31]. In more detail, on the surfaces of M2X, two types of hollow sites exist: hollow sites (A) under which there is no X atom between the transition metal layers and hollow sites (B) under which there is an X atom, as indicated in Fig. 14.7a. Therefore, depending on the relative positions of the termination groups attached to the transition metal atoms, at least four different configurations are possible for the chemical termination of the MXenes. Model 1: two functional groups are located on top of the two transition metals. Model 2: two functional groups are located on top of hollow sites A. Model 3: one of the functional groups is located on top of a hollow site A, and the other functional group is located on top of a hollow site B. Model 4: the two functional groups are located on top of hollow sites B. The model structures of 2 and 4 are shown in Fig. 14.7b, c, respectively.\nThe electronic structure of MXenes is significantly affected by the chosen model structure. Therefore, the above four model structures should be considered for each type of functional group with fully relaxed atomic positions to determine the most stable structure. As a general trend in functionalized MXenes, model 1 is energetically less stable than the other three models, and in many cases it is transformed to one of the models 2–4 during structural optimization. It is also found that the relative structural stabilities of models 2–4 depend mainly on the possible ionic state(s) of the transition metals on the surfaces [31]. If the transition metals can provide sufficient electrons to both X and the attached functional groups, model 2 becomes the most stable configuration [31]. Otherwise, either model 3 or model 4 becomes a more stable configuration [31]. In other words, the chemical groups choose their locations on the surface such that the bonding states of M−X\nμ = 0.0 eV\nMXene systems F OH O Sc2C −12.14 −10.48 −9.35 Ti2C −10.85 −9.61 −9.81 Ti2N −10.68 −9.51 −9.49 Zr2C −11.26 −9.95 −10.90 Zr2N −10.94 −9.75 −11.05 Hf2C −11.18 −10.09 −11.74 Hf2N −10.55 −9.62 −11.75 V2C −9.30 −8.26 −8.09 Nb2C −9.36 −8.32 −8.92 Ta2C −9.03 −8.26 −9.73 Cr2C −8.04 −7.00 −6.89 Cr2N −8.61 −7.47 −7.70\nbonds achieve their highest occupancy [91]. For instance, this can explain why the most stable configuration for Ti2CO2, Zr2CO2, Hf2CO2, Sc2CF2, and Sc2C(OH)2 is model 2, but for Sc2CO2 is the model 3 [31, 91].\nIn order to consider the stability of the functionalized MXene sheets in the experiments, we have calculated their formation energies. The formation energies of the functionalized MXenes are defined as Hf = Etot(M2XTn)-Etot(M2X)(n/2)Etot(T2)-n μ where M2X represents the pristine MXenes without functionalization and T= F, OH, or O groups. n is the number of chemical groups in the supercell. Etot(M2X) and Etot(M2XTn) stand for the total energies of the pristine and functionalized MXenes, respectively. Depending on the functionalization type, Etot(T2) is the total energy of F2, O2+H2, or O2. μ = μ-(1/2)Etot(T2), where μ is the chemical potential of the attached chemical group, which can vary as a function of pressure and temperature [92].\nThe results of the formation energy calculations at μ = 0.0 eV are presented in Table 14.1. From Table 14.1, it can be seen that all the formation energies are large negative values. This indicates the formation of strong bonds between the transition metals and the attached groups, which results in the development of MXene systems with a particular surface functionalization. As seen in Table 14.1, the values of the formation energies for an MXene system functionalized with F, OH, or O are different. To explain the relative stability (formation energy) of an MXene functionalized with F, OH, or O, it is necessary to know the details of effect of the octahedral crystal field created by carbon and the chemical groups on the d orbitals of the transition metal. For example, in a recent study on Ti3C2T2 (T = O, F, OH, and H), it has been shown that due to the generated crystal field, the 3d orbitals of surface Ti atoms split in such a way that they exhibit pseudogaps whose widths predict a stability order Ti3C2O2 > Ti3C2F2 > Ti3C2(OH)2 > Ti3C2H2 > Ti3C2 [93].\nIn the above formation energy calculations, we assumed that the surfaces of MXenes are fully functionalized/terminated by the attached groups, but there is a\nquestion regarding whether the formations of such systems are thermodynamically favorable with respect to the lower functionalization. In order to investigate the thermodynamic feasibility of formation of such systems, we have examined the formation energies of Ti2C systems at different oxygen concentrations and chemical potentials. We have selected Ti2C becasue its monolayer has been experimentally produced and it is a representative of MXene systems with interesting electronic and thermoelectric properties, as will be shown later. In this regard, we have constructed a 2×2 model of Ti2C, containing eight Ti and four carbon atoms, and functionalized both its side surfaces with 1 (lowest concentration) to 8 (highest concentration) oxygen atoms in a super cell. For each oxygen concentration, there are many different possibilities. We have considered more than 100 different structures of Ti8C4(O2) n2 systems, n = 1–8. The formation energies of each oxygen concentration are plotted in Fig. 14.8 as a function of the chemical potential in the range −6.0 to 0.0 eV. As shown in Fig. 14.8, in a very wide range of the chemical potentials between −4.0 and 0.0 eV, the structure with full oxygen coverage (with eight oxygen atoms) is thermodynamically the most favorable configuration in comparison to other configurations with lower oxygen concentrations. Because the chemical potential is estimated to vary from 0 to −0.8 in the temperature range 230–750 K [92], the full termination is the most stable configuration under such this condition [31]. The above thermodynamic analysis has been examined in other systems too [94]. In all cases, it has been shown that MXenes with full surface functionalizion are thermodynamically more favorable than those with less surface functionalizion [31, 94].\nMoreover, we have also calculated the phonon spectra of the fully terminated Ti2C with oxygen atoms. It is observed that all phonon frequencies are positive, signifying that this system is in its equilibrium state. In recent studies, phonon frequency analyses have been performed on almost all members of MXene family with full surface functionalization [31, 34, 36, 95, 96]. It is observed many of them obtain completely positive phonon frequencies. Therefore, various fully\n268 M.

The band structure calculations reveal that Sc2C(OH)2 has a direct band gap and the other semiconductors have indirect band gaps. Becasue Ti, Zr, and Hf are in the same group in the periodic table with the same number of electrons in the outermost partially filled atomic orbital shell ([Ar]3d24s2, [Kr]4d25s2, and [Xe]4f145d26s2), the corresponding MXene systems exhibit similar metallic to semiconducting behavior upon the same type of functionalization. It is also predicted that both F and OH groups similarly affect the electronic structure of a pristine MXene system [31]. This is because each F or OH group is capable of receiving only one electron from the surfaces. By the same token, the O group differs from the F and OH groups because it requires two electrons from the surfaces to be stabilized [31].\nIn order to understand why some of the MXenes become semiconducting, the electronic structures of MXenes with and without the surface functionalizations have been systematically studied [31]. The calculations show that pristine M2X (X = C or N) systems are all metallic with the Fermi energy located at the d bands of transition metals. In most MXenes, the p bands of carbon/nitrogen X appear below the d bands separated by a small band gap. With the F, OH, or O functionalization, new bands are generated below the Fermi energy, resulting from F or O p orbitals hybridized with M d orbitals. Sc2CT2 (T = F, OH, or O), Ti2CO2, Zr2CO2, and Hf2CO2 become semiconducting because the functionalization shifts the Fermi energy to the center of the gap between the M d bands and the X p bands. As examples, Fig. 14.9 shows the PDOS and projected band structures for Ti2C, Ti2CF2, and Ti2CO2. It has also been shown that the band gap of Ti2CO2\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 269\nand Sc2CO2 can be significantly varied by applying either a strain [100, 101] or an external electric field [102, 103].\nRecently experimenters have realized a set of MAX phases with in-plane ordered double transition metals with a chemical formula of (M2/3M′1/3)2AlC (M = Mo or V; M′ = Sc, Y, or Zr) [9, 104]. Our calculations indicated that oxygen-terminated (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C and (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2C MXenes are semiconducting with indirect band gaps of 0.45 and 0.04 eV, respectively [105]. The origin of these band gaps may be attributed to the splitting of Mo d orbital-dominated bands. In functionalized MXenes, the transition metals are surrounded by carbon atoms and the attached chemical groups (F, OH, or O). Such a local environment splits the d bands into subbands [93]. More precisely, the states near the Fermi energy can be assigned as t2g bands hybridized with C, F, or O p orbitals via the dpπ coupling. In the case of (Mo2/3Y1/3)2CO2 and (Mo2/3Sc1/3)2CO2, the t2g bands further split due to the low symmetry structure, resulting in finite band gaps."

      "text" : "Because many MXenes contain heavy 4d and 5d transition metals, the relativistic SOC affects the electronic structures significantly. As shown in Fig. 14.10, without considering the SOC, M2CO2 (M = Mo, W), M2M′C2O2 (M = Mo, W; M′ = Ti, Zr, W), and Ti3N2F2 are semiconducting with a zero energy gap (semimetallic) because the topmost valence band and the lowest conduction band touch only at the point, around which the valence and conduction bands are both parabolic. The projected band structure calculations reveal that the bands near the Femi energy originate from the d orbitals of the transition metals M and M′. Upon considering the SOC, the degeneracy of the topmost valence band and the lowest conduction band at the Fermi energy is lifted, and the band gap is open at the point (see lower panels in Fig. 14.10). Consequently, M2CO2, M2M′C2O2, and Ti3N2F2 turn\n270 M. Khazaei et al.\ninto semiconductors with indirect band gaps [33, 34, 37]. The induced band gap is larger as the SOC is larger [34]. It is found that the band gaps can be as large as 0.194 eV (0.472 eV) for W2CO2 and 0.285 (0.401 eV) for W2HfC2O2 within the GGA (hybrid functional HSE06) [33, 34, 37]. The band gap of Ti3N2F2 is approximately 0.02 eV [37].\nThe SOC lifts the degeneracy of the bands at the point by inducing a finite gap. The nature of these bands around the Fermi energy can be characterized by the Z2 topological invariant. Because M2CO2, M2M′C2O2, and Ti3N2F2 MXenes have inversion symmetry, the Z2 topological invariant can be simply calculated from the parity of the valence band wave functions at the time reversal invariant momentum\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 271\n(TRIM) points of the Brillouin zone [106, 107]. For the hexagonal structure, the TRIM points are located at , k1 = (0, 0); M1, k2 = (0, 0.5); M2, k3 = (0.5, 0); and M3, k4 = (0.5, 0.5); and therefore the Z2 index ν (= 0, 1) is evaluated by (−1)ν = 4i=1δ(ki ), where δ(ki ) = Nn=1ηn(ki), ηn(ki) (= ±1) is the parity of the nth valence band at TRIM ki and N is the number of occupied valence bands [106, 107]. The trivial and nontrivial topological phases are identified with ν = 0 and 1, respectively. The parity analysis of the occupied bands at the TRIM points reveals that ν = 1 for all the systems discussed here, M2CO2 (M = Mo, W), M2M′C2O2 (M = Mo, W; M′ = Ti, Zr, Hf), and Ti3NF2 [33, 34, 37].\nOne of the remarkable characteristics of the topological insulators is the presence of an odd number of topologically protected conducting edge states that cross the Fermi energy. The 2D topological insulators display intriguing conducting edge states in which electrons with opposite spins propagate in the opposite directions and thus they are robust against nonmagnetic impurities and disorders [108–111]. In order to further confirm the nontrivial band topology, we also calculate the electronic band structures for the zigzag nanoribbon structures of W2CO2, W2HfC2O2, and Ti3N2F2 with symmetric edges of 80 Å width. Figure 14.11 shows the results of the electronic band structures, which clearly demonstrate that the edge bands cross the Fermi energy odd times along the ̄-X̄ points for both systems.\nThe origin of the topological insulating behavior found in the M2CO2, M2M′C2O2, and Ti3NF2 MXenes is almost the same. As shown in Fig. 14.10, the SOC is essential to open a finite band gap but does not induce the band inversion that is necessary to change the band topology, implying that the band inversion has already occurred in the M2CO2, M2M′C2O2, and Ti3NF2 MXenes before introducing the SOC. This is thus different from most topological insulators for which the SOC is required to induce the band inversion [112–116], although some exceptions have been reported [111, 117–119].\n272 M. Khazaei et al.\nTo understand the band structures in greater details, as an example, we investigate the evolution of the band structures for W2HfC2O2 without the SOC as the lattice constant is uniformly expanded from the optimized constant. Note that the structure is not optimized when the lattice constant is expanded because this makes it much easier to analyze the evolution of the band structures. As shown in Fig. 14.12, the band structures around the Fermi energy are qualitatively the same until the lattice constant is expanded slightly below 20% (1.2a0), where the topmost valence band and the lowest conduction band remain in contact (i.e., degenerate) at the point, and they are essentially composed of the dxy and dx2−y2 orbitals of W and Hf. However, when the lattice constant is expanded more than ∼20%, the band gap opens, and the band characteristics around the Fermi energy change qualitatively at the point, where the topmost valence band is composed of the d3z2−r2 orbital, whereas the lowest conduction bands are doubly degenerate and consist of dxy and dx2−y2 orbitals. More interestingly, we find that band inversion occurs at the point concomitantly when the band gap opens. We should note that neither the band inversion nor the gap closing occurs at other momenta except for the point.\nThe evolution of the electronic bands at the point is summarized schematically in Fig. 14.13. When the lattice constant is very large ( 1.2a0, where a0 is the optimized lattice constant) and the SOC is absent, W2HfC2O2 is a trivial band insulator in which the two topmost valence bands are made of bonding and nonbonding states of d3z2−r2 orbitals with even and odd parities, respectively, while the lowest conduction bands are doubly degenerate and formed by a bonding state of dxy /dx2−y2 orbitals with even parity. As the lattice constant is reduced, the hybridization between neighboring d orbitals increases. As a result, the bonding state of the doubly degenerate dxy /dx2−y2 orbitals shifts downward below the Fermi energy, while the nonbonding state of the d3z2−r2 orbital moves above the Fermi energy. Because these two states have opposite parities, this is precisely when band inversion occurs. Note that the Fermi energy remains exactly at the doubly degenerate dxy /dx2−y2 states once the band inversion occurs, and therefore the\nsystem remains semimetallic. However, as soon as the SOC is introduced, the doubly degeneracy is lifted, and the system becomes a nontrivial insulator. The role of the SOC is thus to induce a finite band gap but not band inversion, which has similarly been observed in ZrTe5 [120], square-octagonal WS2 [121], and MX (M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Br, I) [117]. It should be emphasized once again that the band inversion occurs in these topologically nontrivial MXenes mostly among d orbitals (more precisely, dz and dxy/dx2−y2 orbitals) of the transition metals [33, 34], not involving s and p orbitals as in the previously known or predicted topological insulators [108–111].\nWe have also studied the electronic structures of M2M′2C3O2 (M = Mo, W; M′ = Ti, Zr, Hf), i.e., MXenes with four transition metal layers. From the band structures and the Z2 index calculations, we find that the M2M′2C3O2 MXenes are nontrivial topological semimetals. The orbital characteristics of the bands near the Fermi energy around the point are very similar to those in the M2M′2C2O2 systems. Because of the local D3d hexagonal symmetry, the touching valence and conduction bands at the point are mainly dominated by the dxy and dx2−y2 orbitals of M and M′. In Mo2Hf2C3O2 and W2Hf2C3O2, band inversion is induced by the SOC at the point between the W-dxy/dx2−y2 and W-d3z2−r2 bands, while in the other M2M′2C3O2 (M = Mo, W; M′ = Ti, Zr) MXenes, the SOC only induces the band gap at the point but band inversion occurs due to the hybridization of the neighboring orbitals, similar to the M2M′C2O2 systems."

Second, during the synthesis of MXenes, their surfaces are functionalized naturally, which changes the electrostatic potential near the surfaces and affects the electronic structures, especially giving rise to the shift of the Fermi level. These two features have significant effects on the work function [36].\nThe work function is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi energy and the vacuum level (the electrostatic potential away from the surface). From the work function calculations of M2C and M10C9 (M = Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta) as well as M′2N and M′10N9 (M′ = Ti, Zr, and Hf) functionalized with F, OH, and O, it is found that the work functions of the bare and functionalized MXenes with F, OH, and O are distributed in the ranges 3.3–4.8, 3.1–5.8, 1.6–2.8, and 3.3– 6.7 eV, respectively [36]. It is also shown that work functions always decrease upon functionalization with OH. This is in remarkable contrast with the systems functionalized with F or O, in which the work functions increase or decrease depending on the type of transition metal. Interestingly, M2C(OH)2, M10C9(OH)2, M′2N(OH)2, and M′10N9(OH)2 all exhibit ultralow work functions, as compared with work functions of the corresponding bare and the functionalized MXenes with F and O [36]. The thickness dependences of the work function for Tin+1Cn (n = 1– 9) functionalized with F, OH, and O have been systematically studied, and it has been shown that, regardless of the thickness, a family of Tin+1Cn(OH)2 exhibits an ultralow work function [36].\nBy using the Poisson equation, it can be shown that the electrostatic potential away from the surface can be related to the surface dipole moment, and thus, the work function [122] = −e/ 0 P = −180.95 P with = − 0 and P = p−p0. Here, e (C) is the charge of an electron, 0 (CV−1 Å−1) is the vacuum permittivity, and 0( ) and p0 (p) are the work function and the surface dipole moment without (with) functionalization, respectively. As seen from Fig. 14.14, the work function properties of MXenes can be well explained by the surface dipole moments because the change in the work function ( ) upon functionalization is linearly correlated with the change in the surface dipole moment ( P ). The positive (negative) value of corresponds to the increase (decrease) in the work function when the surface is functionalized. This indicates that MXenes also follow the above rule, whereas correlates with P almost linearly with a slope of −170.012 VÅ [36].\nIn general, three main factors control the surface dipole moment upon deposition of any element: (i) the redistribution of electron charge between the surface and the adsorbates, (ii) the surface relaxation caused by the adsorbates, and (iii) the polarity of the adsorbates [36, 122]. By decomposing the P into the above three contributions, we can explain the work function properties of MXenes seen in Fig. 14.14 [36]. Further analysis on the MXenes indicates that the work function of the F and O functionalized MXenes is controlled by two factors, i.e., the dipole moment induced by the charge transfer between F/O and the substrate and the change in the total surface dipole moment caused by the surface relaxation upon\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 275\nfunctionalization. Besides these two factors, the intrinsic dipole moment of the OH group plays the most important role in determining the total dipole moment, which consequently explains the ultralow work function found in the OH-terminated MXenes [36]."

      "text" : "A careful examination of the projected band structures of the OH-terminated MXenes has revealed that some of the states around the point, near and above the Fermi energy, do not constitute any of the composed elements [35]. As examples, the projected band structures of Sc2C(OH)2 and Hf2C(OH)2 are shown in Fig. 14.15. These states mainly distribute in the vacuum region outside the hydrogen atoms, and, more interestingly, they have nearly free electron (NFE) characteristics with parabolic energy dispersions with respect to the crystal wave vector [35].\nThe electron localization function (ELF) analysis [123] in Fig. 14.16 shows clearly that there exists a uniform floating electron gas above the hydrogen atoms in MXenes such as Hfn+1Cn(OH)2 (n = 1, 2, and 3) with partially occupied NFE states. It has been shown that Ti2C(OH)2, Zr2C(OH)2, Zr2N(OH)2, Hf2N(OH)2,\n276 M. Khazaei et al.\nNb2C(OH)2, and Ta2C(OH)2 also possess partially occupied NFE states [35]. The lowest energy NFE states in Sc2C(OH)2, Ti2N(OH)2, and V2C(OH)2 are unoccupied and located above the Fermi energy but at a much lower energy than those of the graphene, graphane, BN, and MoS2 (see Fig. 14.15). Therefore, these unoccupied NFE states in OH-terminated MXenes should be accessible more easily than those in other known 2D systems [35].\nLike the OH-terminated MXenes, the F- and O-terminated MXenes also exhibit the NFE states. However, the NFE states in the F- and O-terminated MXenes are located at much higher energies. For example, as shown in Fig. 14.15, the lowest energy NFE states of Hf2CF2 and Hf2CO2 appear around 3 and 5 eV above the Fermi energy, respectively. This already implies that the NFE states of the F- and O-terminated MXenes are not suitable for application purposes. The NFE states can\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 277\nbe only formed in the spatial regions away beyond the surfaces toward the vacuum in the electrostatic potential wells. In this regard, the shallow potential tails in the OH-terminated MXenes are found near the Fermi level (due to positively charged hydrogen atoms at the surfaces [35]), while the shallow potential tails in the F- and O-terminated systems are located far above the Fermi level. Hence, the NFE states of the OH-terminated MXenes are generally found near the Fermi level, while those in F- and O-terminated MXenes appear at higher energies [35]. As shown in Fig. 14.16, the presence of the NFE states and the location relative to the Fermi energy do not depend significantly on the thickness of the MXenes. This is because the thickness of the MXenes cannot essentially change the nature of the surface charges; i.e., the surface of the OH-terminated (F- and O-terminated) MXenes remains positively (negatively) charged, independent of the thickness.\nElectron transport properties of MXenes with partially occupied NFE states have also been studied [35]. The calculations can show the signature of the NFE states in electron conduction [35]. The electron transport properties of MXenes, which possess NFE states, are important because these states are located above the MXene surfaces (see Fig. 14.17) and can conduct electrons through the nearly free channels without being significantly scattered by the surface vibrations at finite temperatures. The transmission analysis indeed clearly shows that the NFE states\n278 M. Khazaei et al.\ncan act as both hole and electron channels at low bias voltages, thus making them suitable for applications in low-power nanoelectronic devices [35]. It is noteworthy that the partially occupied NFE states near the Fermi energy are sensitive to the conditions and indeed they disappear by applying large compressive or tensile strains; adsorbing molecules such as O2, N2, and CO; or hetrostructuring the MXenes with graphene, BN, or graphane [35]. It has also been proposed that due to their localized states that appear above the hydrogen atoms, the OH-terminated MXenes may offer potential application for Pb and heavy metal purification for environmental remediation [124, 125]."

      "heading" : "Thermoelectric Properties",
      "text" : "Owing to their intrinsic ceramic nature, MXenes may be suitable as thermoelectric materials for energy conversion applications at high temperatures. The performance of thermoelectric material is quantified through the dimensionless figure of merit ZT given as S2σT/K , where S, σ , T , and K (= kl + ke) are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature, and thermal conductivity with both lattice (kl) and electronic (ke) contributions, respectively. In general, ZT can be maximized when the power factor (S2σ ) is maximized and the thermal conductivity is simultaneously minimized. The thermal conductivity can be minimized efficiently by enhancing the phonon scattering in the presence of edges, interfaces, grain boundaries, and embedded nanostructures [126]. However, maximizing S2σ is not straightforward because both S and σ are strongly coupled to the electronic structure of the system and usually behave inversely: a material that has a high Seebeck coefficient has a poor electrical conductivity and vice versa. Therefore, a trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity at a particular p- or n-type carrier concentration is required so as to maximize the power factor. Here, the thermoelectric transport properties, the Seebeck coefficient (S),\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 279\nthe electron conductivity (σ ), and the power factor (S2σ ), were computed within the Boltzmann theory [127] and the constant relaxation time (τ ) approximation. Within this approximation, the Seebeck coefficient becomes τ -independent without any other adjustable parameter, but the electrical conductivities and thus the power factors are obtained with respect to τ . On the basis of this approximation, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient tensors of a material can be written as\nσαβ = 1 ∫ σαβ[ − ∂fμ(T , , μ)\n∂ ]d\nSαβ(T , μ) = 1 eT σαβ(T , μ)\n∫ σαβ( − μ)[ − ∂fμ(T , , μ)\n∂ ]d\nσαβ = e 2\nN i,kτi,kvα(i, k)vβ(i, k)δ( − i,k)\nwhere α and β are tensor indices; , μ, and f are the volume of the unit cell, chemical potential, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, respectively; and e is the electron charge. N indicates the number of k points sampled. In the formulations v(i,k) (α = x, y, z) is the αth component of the group velocity of the carriers (=1/h̄∇ i,k). The above formulations have already been implemented in BoltzTraP code.\nOn the basis of Boltzmann theory and first-principles electronic structure calculations, the power factor S2σ of monolayer and multilayer M2C (M = Sc, Ti, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta) and M2N (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) MXenes functionalized with F, OH, and O groups has already been explored [32]. It has been shown that the metallic (semiconducting) MXenes are poor (good) thermoelectric materials [32]. For example, as shown in Fig. 14.18 for Nb2CF2, the metallic MXenes exhibit excellent electrical conductivity but a very poor Seebeck coefficient, consequently having a very poor power factor. On the other hand, the semiconducting MXenes exhibit relatively poor electric conductivity, but an excellent Seebeck coefficient, resulting in a relatively good power factor. Among the semiconducting MXenes, Mo2CF2 (see Fig. 14.18) exhibit superior power factor over other MXenes, and thus it is a potential thermoelectric material in the MXene family [32]. The exceptionally superior thermoelectric property of Mo2CF2 is attributed to the peculiar band structure near the band edge, where flat and dispersive bands are merged. This type of band shapes allows for a large Seebeck coefficient and simultaneously a good electrical conductivity at low carrier concentrations [128–130].\nThe effect of a band gap on enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient can be understood through its formula [131–133]. The Seebeck coefficient is proportional to ν\nσ , where σ is the electrical conductivity and ν is the ( -μ) weighted by the average value of the squared band velocities of electrons multiplied by the DOS and the derivative of the Fermi function (f( )) with respect to the energy (df( )/d ). The ( -μ)df( )/d has opposite signs in the energy regions above and below the chemical potential [32]. Thus, it can be easily understood that S tends to be large once the DOS and band velocities at above and below the chemical potential exhibit a large\n14 Electronic Properties and Applications of MXenes from Ab Initio. . . 281\ncontrast [134, 135]. Accordingly, if the chemical potential is located in the energy region where the DOS and band velocities change smoothly, the Seebeck coefficient would be small due to the cancellation of the positive and negative contributions. This is the reason why Nb2CF2 with a smooth DOS near the original Fermi level exhibits a negligible Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 14.18). In semiconducting materials, as the chemical potential moves toward the band edges, the difference between the number of states above and below the chemical potential increases, which results in an increase in S. For this reason, the semiconducting MXenes such as Mo2CF2 exhibit large Seebeck coefficients near the band edges (Fig. 14.18).\nThe thermal conductivity of various MXenes, e.g., M2CO2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) [136, 137], Sc2CT2 (T = F, O, OH) [138, 139], and Mo2C [140], has also been studied by taking into account both phonon and electron contributions. These MXenes are all semiconducting except for pristine Mo2C which is metallic. The thermal conductivity is in general anisotropic along the armchair and zigzag directions [137]. Among M2CO2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf), Ti2CO2 and Hf2CO2 exhibit the lowest and highest lattice thermal conductivities, respectively, in the temperature range 300–700 K. Consequently, Ti2CO2 achieves a higher figure of merit ZT for thermoelectric application (ZT= 0.45 for 14.0 × 1020 cm−3 n-doping and ZT= 0.27 for 1.7 × 1020 cm−3 p-doping [136]) because of the low thermal conductivity and the high carrier mobility [136, 137]. The room temperature thermal conductivity of Hf2CO2 is 62.12–131.2 (27.63–53.03) Wm−1K−1 along the armchair (zigzag) flake length of 1–100 μm [137]. Among Sc2CT2 (T= F, O, OH), Sc2C(OH)2 is predicted to be a candidate for thermoelectric application at elevated temperatures higher than 300 K due to a relatively good Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and very low lattice thermal conductivity [138]. At room temperature, the thermal conductivity of Sc2C(OH)2 along the armchair (zigzag) direction can be as large as 123–245 (78.5–148) Wm−1K−1 when the flake length increases from 1 to 50 μm [139]. The room temperature thermal conductivity of Mo2C is also evaluated to be 48.4 (64.7) Wm−1K−1 for the armchair (zigzag) flake length of 100 μm [140]. From the calculations it is predicted that maximum ZT of MXenes will be less than 1.1 [141]."

It was shown that many of MAX phases can be exfoliated into 2D MXenes. Also we have shown that charge injection could affect the possibility of exfoliation significantly. Then, the structural and electronic properties of MXenes have been studied. We have shown that upon an appropriate surface functionalization, some of the MXenes turn into semiconducting from the original metallic. The physics behind topologically trivial or nontrivial behavior of metallic or semiconducting MXenes have been discussed in detail. Moreover, by considering the surface dipole moments, it was exhibited how the surface functionalization of MXenes could affect their work function and consequently their surface states. Finally, as an example of applications of MXenes, using the Boltzmann theory and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we explored the thermoelectric properties of MXenes.

      "text" : "While there have been significant research efforts into the properties of 2D semiconductors and optoelectronic materials, 2D magnetic materials are relatively unexplored. Two-dimensional magnetic materials are desirable for their potential applications in quantum computation, logic and memory operations, spintronics, and any electronic device that relies on manipulation of the spin degree of freedom of carriers [1–3]. The search for intrinsic 2D magnetism is also motivated by interest in understanding the fundamental physics of spin processes and phase transitions in two dimensions. However, most experimentally realized 2D materials thus far are intrinsically nonmagnetic. In fact, long-range magnetic ordering is prohibited in two-dimensional systems with continuous spin symmetry at finite temperatures, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem [4]. The search for practically useful magnetic 2D materials must, therefore, focus on systems with magnetic anisotropy that can be reliably produced and that are robust to oxidation and thermal fluctuations.\nMXenes hold great promise for achieving intrinsic 2D magnetism because of their available chemical and structural diversity. Over 70 different MXenes have been proposed theoretically [5], and millions of solid solutions are possible with various M-X systems. Of these, a few have already been synthesized, and some MXenes have been predicted to be intrinsically magnetic. The choice of M (transition metal) atom provides freedom in the number of d-electrons in the system, which may be strongly spin-polarized depending on the transition metal coordination environment.

Furthermore, surface functionalization via F, OH, or O groups provides an additional degree of chemical freedom that may be used to tune the magnetic ground state.\nBeyond the diversity of choices in M, X, and T atoms, MXenes also allow for ordered double transition metal structures with the general formula M2M’nXn+1Tx (n = 1–2) and a variable number of layers (n = 1–3) in single transition metal systems. Careful design of such MXene systems has yielded structures that are predicted to have magnetic ground states without any doping, defect, or strain engineering, suggesting the possibility that they may be synthesized in a crystalline state [7]. A fraction of the diversity of predicted magnetic and transport behavior in MXenes is illustrated in Fig. 15.1.\nBefore discussing the variety of magnetic properties and strategies for tuning these properties in MXenes, we first briefly introduce a general framework [7, 8] for understanding and predicting magnetism in MXene monolayers. While unsaturated p-orbitals in graphene with point defects [9] and zigzag edges in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [10] result in ferromagnetism in 2D systems, controlling the magnetic response in a predictable manner remains a challenge. In contrast, the magnetic ordering in many MXenes is intrinsic to the chemical and structural composition of pristine structures. In MXenes, transition metal atom d-orbitals lie between bonding (σ ) and antibonding (σ ∗) states from the M-X and M-T bonds. Assuming nominal oxidation of all constituent atoms, the bonding states are filled while the antibonding states are unfilled. Therefore, only electrons in the nonbonding d-orbitals contribute to the magnetic behavior.\nThe octahedral crystal field imposed on the transition metal atoms from its nearest neighbors further splits the nonbonding d-orbitals into low energy dxy, dyz, and dxz (t2g) states and high energy dx2- y2 and dz2 (eg) states. A schematic of this alignment of the states near the Fermi level is shown in Fig. 15.2. The available\neg\nt2g\ns *\ns\nnumber of electrons then determines the filling of the d-bands and gives rise to a wide variety of possible magnetic behavior. This picture is complicated somewhat by the coupling between transition metal cations that is mediated by the nonmagnetic X and T anions. Based on symmetry considerations and the occupancies of overlapping orbitals, the semi-empirical Goodenough-Kanamori rules have been used to rationalize the effects of double-exchange and superexchange in MXenes [8]. In general, the calculated DOS of O-terminated magnetic MXenes show broad peaks, indicating delocalized electrons with itinerant character, which stabilize ferromagnetic (FM) ordering via a double-exchange interaction. Electrons are more localized in F-terminated MXenes, leading to a weaker double-exchange interaction and a more dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange interaction that favors AFM ordering. The interplay of these interactions is not trivial and may lead to unexpected magnetic ground states."

      "text" : "Khazaei et al. first predicted ground state ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2C and Cr2N MXenes [11]. Ferromagnetic ground states are of particular interest due to the potential applications in spintronics and coupling to other 2D systems that may allow for probing novel phenomena. While the covalent M-X and M-T bonds are in general quite strong and lead to nonmagnetic ground states, various studies have reported intrinsic magnetism in both bare and functionalized MXenes beyond Cr2C and Cr2N. Bare Ti2C and Ti2N also exhibit intrinsic ferromagnetism [12].\nBecause of the surface functionalization that is inevitably introduced during the synthesis of MXenes, it is desirable to identify systems that retain a magnetic ground state after surface termination. Especially considering that other candidate 2D magnetic materials are vulnerable to oxidation, it is beneficial to find magnetic MXenes that are robust to oxidation and suitable for potential device applications. The single transition metal Ti2NO2 and Cr2NO2 are ferromagnetic [8, 13], as well as the ordered double transition metal Cr2VC2T2 (T = OH, F, O) [14], Hf2MnC2O2,\n294 N. C. Frey et al.\nand Hf2VC2O2 [7]. To date, the Mn2NTx and Ti2MnC2Tx MXenes have been shown to exhibit robust ferromagnetism regardless of surface functionalization [7, 8]. These systems, with high predicted Curie temperatures and strong spinpolarization with high magnetic moments (greater than 3 μB/unit cell), are therefore more robust than materials that rely on induced magnetism [15]. Additionally, these ferromagnetic MXenes exhibit a range of transport behavior including metallicity, half-metallicity, semi-metallicity, and semi-conductivity.\nThere have been comparatively more reports of antiferromagnetism in MXenes. In contrast to FM ordering, AFM ordering results in a zero net magnetization that makes the spin degree of freedom difficult to control or use in devices. Recently, experimental developments in AFM spintronics [17] and topological AFM spintronics [18] have changed the historical view of antiferromagnetic systems as a theoretical curiosity and intensified interest in the search for robust 2D AFM systems. To this end, multiple models for AFM ordering in MXenes have been proposed. In general, there are two considered AFM spin configurations in MXenes, which have transition metal atoms arranged in a bilayer triangular lattice: (1) intralayer FM coupling and interlayer AFM coupling and (2) intralayer AFM coupling and interlayer FM coupling. These arrangements are referred to as AFM1 and AFM2, respectively, in Fig. 15.3. Note that these spin configurations are only models for AFM order, and complications arise when considering the spin frustration inherent in the triangular sublattice. V2C [12], V2CTx (T = F, OH) [19], Cr2CTx (T = F, Cl, OH, H) [16], Cr2N, and Cr2NTx (T = OH, F) [13] have all been predicted to be antiferromagnetic in the ground state. Among the ordered double transition metal MXenes, Cr2TiC2Tx (T = F, OH) [14], Hf2MnC2Tx (T = F, OH), and Hf2VC2Tx (T = F, OH) [7] exhibit AFM ordering.\nA new class of so-called “Janus” MXenes, which break symmetry via asymmetric surface functionalization, demonstrate both intrinsic FM and AFM ordering. Of particular interest in these systems is the possibility to tune the magnetic and transport behavior by the chemically different top and bottom layer functionalization, which creates a mismatch in the M atom d-states. Members of the Janus Cr2CTT’ (T, T’ = H, F, Cl, Br, OH) family are predicted to exhibit bipolar antiferromagnetic semiconductor behavior with high Neel temperatures [20] and switching to a half-metallic antiferromagnet state under a gate voltage [21]. Asymmetrically functionalized O-Ti2C-Li monolayers show half-metallic\n15 Predicted Magnetic Properties of MXenes 295\nferromagnetism by inducing substantial differences in the valence states of the Ti layers [22]. With mixed surface termination, Mn2NOxF2−x (x = 0.5, 1, or 1.5) is a robust Ising ferromagnet, while Cr2COxF2−x, Ti2COxF2−x, and V2COxF2−x exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering [23]. Applied electric fields stabilize ferromagnetism in Mn2NOxF2−x, leading to enhanced Curie temperatures, and enable switching from AFM to FM ordering in Cr2COxF2−x [23].\nThe essential ingredient for stabilizing nanoscale magnetism in MXenes (and enabling practical device applications) is magnetic anisotropy. Spin-orbit coupling and covalent bonds provide anisotropy in 2D materials by symmetry breaking, resulting in energetically favorable orientations for magnetic moments. Recent work has provided a simple and effective method for using calculated magnetic anisotropy values to more accurately predict Curie temperatures in 2D materials [24, 25]. Spin-orbit coupling is increased in MXenes by increasing the mass of the M atom, while highly directional (anisotropic) covalent bonds are formed by O surface functionalization. Thus, MXenes like Mn2NO2 are engineered to exhibit strong magnetic anisotropy and intrinsic, out-of-plane Ising ferromagnetism [26]. The magnetic anisotropy can be tuned through further changes in the M and T atoms to achieve in-plane XY and isotropic Heisenberg magnetism [26]. This tunability is shown schematically in Fig. 15.4."

      "text" : "Strain or impurity induced magnetism in MXenes opens new possibilities in the regime of microscopic understanding of magnetism in these systems. Often doping or defects induce local magnetic centers in low dimensional systems, whereas strain engineering leads to overall displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium positions, and as a result, electronic rearrangement may lead to magnetic phase changes in the system.\nA recent study focusing on strain-induced magnetism, using density functional theory calculations, elucidated the effect of biaxial symmetric mechanical strains\non M2C (M = Hf, Nb, Sc, Ta, Ti, V, Zr) MXenes (shown in Fig. 15.5). Without the application of strain, only Ti2C and Zr2C exhibit an appreciable magnetic moment of 1.92 and 1.25 μB/unit cell, respectively. Increase in tensile strain induces magnetism in all the other nonmagnetic MXene sheets and leads to nonmagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transitions. Hf2C, exhibiting an overall 0.0 μB/unit cell magnetic moment in its strain-free form, shows the most drastic change, with an induced magnetic moment of 1.5 μB/unit cell, achieved at a strain of 1.80%. The magnetic properties of strained Hf2C are attributed to the band shift mainly involving Hf(5d) states [27]. Another study predicts an AFM1 to FM phase transformation in a V2C MXene system upon application of biaxial strain and an overall magnetic moment of 1.0 μB/unit cell [12]. MXene systems can maintain their structure with even 9.5% biaxial strain [28], thus these methods can be applied to reliably tune the magnetic properties of MXenes.\nDoping nonmetal atoms (B, Si, etc.) in the X layer or doping transition metal atoms in the M layer also leads to interesting magnetic behavior. Nonmetal doping can generate magnetic moments up to 1.0 μB/unit cell in MXenes [29]. Doping Ti, V, Cr, or Mn atoms into Sc2CT2 systems modifies the magnetic nature of the system, e.g., Ti- and V-doped Sc2CT2 systems are nonmagnetic or weakly magnetic in nature, whereas late transition metal Cr and Mn doping atoms can induce a 2.1 μB/unit cell magnetic moment because of an electron redistribution in the system [30].\nRecently, Sang et al. experimentally confirmed the presence of atomic defects in MXene layers [31], and these defects can also alter the magnetic properties of MXenes. In the case of Ti2XT2 systems (X = C/N, T = O, F, OH), X-vacancies (VX) lead to magnetization of the MXene layers, with an exception of VC in Ti2CO2. This happens because of the dangling bonds near the defect sites and the electronic redistribution which leads to a local magnetic moment that can be as high as 2.19 μB/unit cell with an FM to NM stabilization energy of 70 meV/supercell [32]. This has been confirmed by the electron density gain in the nonbonding eg levels of MXene systems with VC [33].\n15 Predicted Magnetic Properties of MXenes 297"

      "text" : "The field of spintronics began with the discovery of the giant magnetoresistance effect (GMR) in thin-layer magnetic heterostructures, where two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched a thin conducting paramagnetic separator. Alignment or antialignment of the spins in the two ferromagnetic layers produces a difference in resistance due to spin-polarization dependent scattering of conducting electrons [1]. The implications of selectively transmitting electrons with specific spins and measuring the magnetic state of a system without applying a field enable potential storage and transmission of information using the spin degree of freedom. While GMR is currently implemented in read heads of magnetic hard disks and non-volatile magnetic random-access memories, materials research is ongoing to develop the necessary components for a full spintronic technology platform. Naturally, these hypothetical devices will only be useful if they can be reliably synthesized below the ten-nanometer length scale of current silicon devices. This requirement emphasizes the unique potential of the 2D MXene structure for realizing accessible magnetic properties on the appropriate length scale. This effort is driven by the demand for smaller and faster information transmission and storage, which faces the physical material limits of conventional silicon-based electronics and the reliance on Coulombic charge transport. Utilizing spin currents has the potential to reduce the power consumption of information flow, as spins can preserve information while transporting through metals, and reduction of spurious magnetic fields that arise from the flow of charged particles [34]. Particularly in topologically insulating phases, these properties can be realized with dissipationless surface states that conduct a net spin current but zero charge current, due to spin-momentum locking in chiral edge states. Figure 15.6 shows a schematic of a spintronic transistor using ferromagnetic domains overlaid on a 2D topological insulator which enables\n298 N. C. Frey et al.\ncontrol over the flow of spin current without inducing net Coulombic charge current [35]. Other ingredients for material spintronics, such as significant spd orbital hybridization and spin-orbit coupling are achievable in MXenes [26, 36]. Furthermore, the initial ability to both solution process and vapor deposit MXenes is consistent with the long-term goal of designing a cost-effective, scalable spintronics platform [37].\nAchieving scalable quantum computation requires a materials platform that can manipulate information through distinct quantum states. The number of operations required to compute “hard” computational problems scales exponentially with regard to the number of operations required as a function of the number of inputs, making these problems intractable using traditional on/off bits for all but the simplest of cases. Quantum computation, using qubits instead of traditional bits, can take advantage of the combinatorics of quantum superposition to enable an equivalent exponential scaling of the number of possible operations, rendering these previously hard problems tractable. One proposed method of constructing coherent, stable qubit systems is realization of Majorana zero-mode quasiparticles by layering a superconducting phase on top of a topological insulator. Although quantum computation is being investigated from several different perspectives, topological protection is highly desired for applicational use since it enables error correction by non-Abelian braiding and protection from mechanical perturbations at the hardware level [38]. The challenge is realizing these exotic quasiparticle statistics on a materials platform that is both robust at room temperature and allows selective spin transport between the two phases. Two-dimensional ferromagnets, which in low dimensions are limited to those systems with magnetic anisotropy, are particularly useful due to their inherent long-range spin correlation and sensitivity to spin currents [39]. Akin to the spintronic transistor in Fig. 15.5, patterned heterostructures of topological, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases will be required to excite and control Majorana modes, invoking the familiar materials science problem of interfacial electronic properties. A diverse family of materials such as MXenes possessing long-range electronic and spin correlation as well as inherently smooth planar interfaces is ideal for exploring the physical building blocks necessary for quantum computation."

      "text" : "Predictions thus far indicate that MXenes are promising candidates for 2D magnetic materials capable of operating in ambient conditions; possessing intrinsic and tunable magnetic ordering, strong magnetic anisotropy, and robustness to oxidation and thermal disorder. Despite the recent progress in predicting the magnetic properties of MXenes, many interesting challenges and unexplored opportunities remain. Perhaps chief among these is the synthesis and characterization of systems that are predicted to be magnetic, although recent success in the demonstration of paramagnetism in Ti3C2 [40] and the synthesis of the Ti4N3Tx nitride MXene and 2D sheets of transition metal nitrides are a promising start [41, 42]. Beyond the\n15 Predicted Magnetic Properties of MXenes 299\ntheoretical studies undertaken to date, there is potential for materials engineering via the proximity effect, which would take advantage of interesting quantum effects that are induced when 2D materials are made into heterostructures. By layering magnetic MXenes or coupling magnetic MXenes to systems with large spin-orbit coupling, a nearly unlimited range of novel devices and applications may be realized."

      "text" : "Two-dimensional materials attract great attention due to the breadth of physical properties that they offer and their potential for a variety of applications. Active exploration of 2D materials started after the isolation of individual monolayer flakes of graphene [1–3], and now the still growing family of 2D materials includes hexagonal boron nitride, phosphorene, silicene, and transition metal chalcogenides among many others [4–6].\nGraphene flakes were first isolated from graphite crystals using an adhesive tape by micromechanical exfoliation [1, 2]. Although this method is time- and labor-consuming and the resulting flakes are relatively small, they are of very high structural quality and were historically used for measuring most of the fundamental physical properties of graphene. Such measurements performed on individual flakes revealed that graphene possesses a number of unique characteristics, including ultrahigh charge carrier mobilities of over 2 × 105 cm2/ V · s [7, 8], high Young’s modulus (~1 TPa) [9, 10] and optical transparency (~97.7%) [11], and excellent thermal conductivity of up to 5300 W/m · K [12]. These properties make graphene promising for a variety of applications ranging from electronics and energy storage to separation and mechanically reinforced composites [13, 14].\nWhile the micromechanical exfoliation is ideal for the preparation of individual graphene crystals for research needs [15] and it is still used in laboratories worldwide more than a decade after its original introduction, this method cannot be scaled up to produce bulk quantities of graphene for commercial applications. Therefore, a great deal of research was focused on the development of large-scale\nA. Lipatov · A.

In addition to many other important synthetic advancements, these efforts produced new methods for graphene growth on metal substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [16–20] and revitalized interest in graphene oxide (GO), a solution-processable material produced by oxidation of graphite in harsh acid media and known since mid-nineteenth century [21].\nGO is often viewed as a low-cost and scalable alternative to pristine graphene for large-scale applications [22]. GO can be synthesized by several methods, including five major synthetic approaches developed by Brodie [21], Staudenmaier [23], Hofmann [24], Hummers [25], and Tour [26], as well as their multiple variations. For example, in the Hummers method, which was originally introduced in 1958 and remains a commonly used procedure for the GO synthesis, graphite powder is treated with a solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) in concentrated sulfuric acid [25]. Although GO sheets could reach hundreds of μm in lateral size [27] due to functionalization with oxygen-containing moieties they are highly soluble in water and other solvents [28]. Unlike pristine graphene, GO could be conveniently processed into bulk structures, such as coatings [29–31] or a free-standing ‘graphene oxide paper’ [32], or blended with various polymers for their mechanical reinforcement [14, 33]. However, because of the chemical treatment in harsh oxidative conditions, some properties of GO are inferior to those of graphene. Because of the high degree of oxidation the as-synthesized material is an electrical insulator, although the conductivity can be partially restored via chemical reduction of GO to reduced GO (rGO) [34–37]. Extensive oxidation also results in the degradation of mechanical characteristics of graphene.\nBecause of the great potential of GO for large-scale applications [22], it was important to determine its fundamental physical properties and understand how they compare to those of graphene. However, when the measurements (electronic, mechanical, optical, etc.) are performed on a bulk assembly of multiple sheets in the form of a large-scale film or a structural composite, the results are inevitably affected by the interfaces between the flakes and thus do not necessarily provide an accurate representation of GO/rGO’s properties. Therefore, shortly after the characterization of individual flakes of mechanically exfoliated graphene, similar experiments were performed on individual sheets of GO and rGO [34, 35, 38]. While GO/rGO sheets are originally produced in solution, they can be conveniently deposited on a substrate of choice by drop-casting or spin-coating, and then individual rGO flakes can be used for device fabrication [34, 35]. Electrical measurements of such devices revealed that similar to graphene, rGO can exhibit an ambipolar electrical field effect, although the room field-effect mobilities of holes (2–200 cm2/ V · s) and electrons (0.5–30 cm2/ V · s) are several orders of magnitude lower than in graphene [34]. Likewise, GO/rGO flakes can be deposited on substrates with microscopic holes and thus form nanomembranes, which could be used for nanoindentation experiments [38]. The measurements showed that despite some degradation of the integrity of the graphene lattice during the oxidation [39], the Young’s modulus of GO monolayers is still considerably high (>200 GPa) [38, 40] which is about onefifth of the Young’s modulus of pristine graphene [9, 10].\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 303\nThe single-flake measurements were important to determine the place of GO and rGO in the hierarchy of graphene-based materials. Because of its low charge carrier mobilities, rGO is not suitable for high-speed electronic applications, but is very promising for applications, such as conductive thin films and coatings [29–31], separation and filtration [41], gas sensing [42, 43], and mechanically reinforced composite materials [14, 33], for which bulk quantities of an easily processable material are required.\nAmong the latest additions to the family of 2D materials are MXenes, a large class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides with a general formula Mn + 1XnTx, where M stands for a transition metal, such as Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and Sc, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, Tx denotes surface functionalities, such as fluorine, oxygen, and hydroxyl groups, and n = 1, 2, or 3 [44, 45]. MXenes are produced from layered ternary metal carbides/nitrides, called MAX phases, by selective chemical extraction of interleaving layers of an “A” element (group IIIA and IVA elements, e.g., Al). Fluoride-containing acidic solutions, such as HF [45, 46], NH4HF2 [47], or LiF-HCl [48], are used for the A-element (typically, Al) extraction, which results in mixed oxygen- and fluorinecontaining surface terminations. More than 25 different MXenes have been already experimentally demonstrated, and many others have been studied theoretically [49, 50]. Some examples of widely studied MXenes include Ti3C2Tx [46], Ti2CTx [51], Nb2CTx [52], Nb4C3Tx [52], V2CTx [53], and Mo2TiC2Tx [54]. Figure 16.1 summarizes MXene materials that have been experimentally demonstrated, as well as theoretically predicted so far [50].\nThe exploration of many 2D materials followed the footsteps of graphene, starting with micromechanical exfoliation of individual high-quality crystals [55], which was followed by intrinsic property measurements and development of largescale synthetic approaches for various applications. However, the path of MXenes was different, because from the very beginning they were produced by a solution process in large quantities [46] enabling bulk application tests. Soon after their experimental demonstration, MXenes were shown to be promising for a variety of energy storage applications, including Li-ion [45], Li–S [56], Na-ion batteries [57], and supercapacitors [48]. However, while bulk applications of MXenes are rapidly developing, their intrinsic physical property characterization through single-flake measurements remains a largely unexplored area of research, and scarce examples of such studies, which will be reviewed here, focused only on Ti-based MXene materials, Ti2CTx [58] and Ti3C2Tx [59–62]. Yet, such studies are very important for the field, because they not only provide insights into fundamental properties of MXenes and elucidate their potential for the aforementioned and emerging applications, but also enable comparison of different MXene materials with each other.\nElectrical conductivity of MXenes is a very important parameter for a variety of applications, such as energy storage [50], transparent conductive films [63, 64], electromagnetic interference shielding [65], gas [66, 67] and strain sensors [68]. So, a considerable number of papers reported results of electrical measurements, which are summarized in Table 16.1. However, most of these measurements were\n304 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nperformed on bulk MXene structures, including filtered, spin-casted or sprayed films, pressed discs, and particles. These structures vary in thickness, preparation, and postprocessing methods, so the resulting conductivities often show a large spread in values even for the same material. These results clearly illustrate that the conductivity of a bulk assembly of MXene sheets strongly depends on the preparation method, which dictates the stacking of individual MXene sheets and the interflake resistances, underscoring the importance of single-flake measurements for revealing the intrinsic properties of various MXene materials and their comparison with each other.\nIn the following sections, we provide detailed examples of electrical and mechanical characterization of the monolayers of the most studied MXene material to date, Ti3C2Tx. Ti3C2Tx is the first discovered [46] and the most widely studied MXene material to date [50]. It shows higher electrical conductivity than solutionprocessed graphene [59], outstanding electrochemical properties [82], and great promise for various applications ranging from energy storage [50] to electromagnetic interference shielding [65]. After examples of the Ti3C2Tx measurements, we discuss the importance of similar single-flake measurements on other members of the rapidly growing MXene family.\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 305\nTa bl\ne 16\n.1 Su\nm m\nar y\nof ro\nom te\nm pe\nra tu\nre re\nsi st\niv iti\nes fo\nr M\nX en\ne m\nat er\nia ls\nM X\nen e\nFo rm\n,t hi\nck ne\nss R\nes is\ntiv ity\n,× 10\n−6\nm C\non du\nct iv\nity ,S\n/c m\nR ef\ner en\nce s\n2– 1\nM X\nen es\nT i 2\nC T\nx Pr\nes se\nd di\nsc ,0\n.2 m\nm 68\n,0 00\n0. 15\n[5 1]\nE xf\nol ia\nte d\nfr om\nbu lk\nM X\nen e,\nT x =\nO x,\n20 nm\na 5\n20 00\n[6 9]\nT i 2\nN bC\nT x\nPr es\nse d\ndi sc\n,0 .3\nm m\n52 ,0\n00 0.\n2 [5 1] T i 2 N T x Pr es se d di sc ,2 m m 2. 02 49 50 [7 0] V 2 C T x Fi lte re d fil m ,2 0 μ m 6. 4 15 60 [5 3] Fi lte re d fil m ,2 –2 0 μ m Sp in ca st fil m ,1 7– 11 2 nm Fi lte re d fil m ,2 –2 0 μ m ,a nn ea le d 18 h @ 15 0 ◦ C Sp in ca st fil m ,1 7– 11 2 nm ,a nn ea le d 18 h @ 15 0 ◦ C 58 .8 2 ± 2. 08 10 00 ± 10 0 3. 13 ± 0. 10 3. 03 ± 0. 09 17 0 ± 6 10 ± 13 ,2 00 ± 10 0 33 00 ± 10 0 [7 1] V 2 N T x Fi lte re d fil m ,2 0 μ m 2. 4 41 60 [5 3] M o 2 C T x Fi lte re d fil m ,9 μ m Sa m e + an ne al ed 18 h @ 12 0 ◦ C 60 0, 00 0 23 00 0. 01 7 4. 3 [7 2] Fi lte re d fil m ,2 0 μ m 40 25 0 [5 3] M o 2 N T x Fi lte re d fil m ,2 0 μ m 4. 8 20 80 [5 3] M o 1 .3 3 C T x Fi lte re d fil m ,1 2 μ m 33 .7 29 7 [7 3] N b 2 C T x Pr es se d di sc ,0 .4 3 m m 61 0, 00 0 0. 01 7 [5 2] N b 1 .3 3 C T x Fi lte re d fil m ,2 2 μ m 55 6, 00 0 0. 01 8 [7 4] 3– 2 M X en es T i 3 C 2 T x Pr es se d di sc ,0 .2 m m 50 00 2 [5 1] Fi lte re d fil m ,1 3 μ m 4. 2 24 00 [7 5] E pi ta xi al fil m ,2 8 nm E pi ta xi al fil m ,N H 3 in te rc al at ed 31 nm 2. 28 ± 0. 04 5. 01 ± 0. 03 44 00 ± 80 20 00 ± 12 [4 7] C la y, 5 μ m 6. 66 15 00 [4 8] Pa rt ic ul at es ,h or iz on ta lt o ba sa lp la ne Pa rt ic ul at es ,v er tic al to ba sa lp la ne 41 5 72 76 24 00 13 7 [7 6]\n(c on\ntin ue\nd)\n306 A.

Both kinds of materials are prepared in acid solutions and share a number of properties, such as relatively low cost, scalable production, large (μm scale) size of flakes, and solubility in conventional solvents due to the surface functionalization. Similar to previous works on rGO [34, 35], a colloidal solution of Ti3C2Tx can be simply drop-casted onto a Si/SiO2 substrate, and after the solvent drying, individual MXene flake can be identified by optical microscopy and used for device fabrication. Monolayer flakes of Ti3C2Tx are well visible on silicon substrates covered with a 300-nm-thick layer of SiO2, which are routinely used in graphene research [15], although the highest optical contrast was found for SiO2 thicknesses of about 220 nm [61].\nFigure 16.2a shows the schematic illustration of the simplest device that could be used to probe MXene’s electronic properties. It is a field-effect transistor (FET), in which a MXene flake bridges source (S) and drain (D) electrodes, while a conductive highly p-doped Si can be used as a bottom gate (G) electrode. Figure 16.2b illustrates the device fabrication process, showing a representative Ti3C2Tx flake before and after the preparation of a FET. It is important to point out that since MXenes degrade in the presence of water and oxygen [83–85], in order to achieve the highest electrical conductivity of a device, it is imperative to minimize the exposure of flakes to humid air [50].\n308 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nFET devices shown in Fig. 16.2a, b can be employed for a variety of experiments that include (a) probing of electronic properties of MXenes, (b) evaluation and comparison of the efficiencies of synthetic procedures for MXenes, and (c) study of MXenes’ environmental stability. In the following sections, we provide examples of these experiments."

      "heading" : "Electronic Properties of Ti3C2Tx",
      "text" : "Figure 16.2c demonstrates a representative drain–source current (IDS) – drain– source voltage (VDS) dependence recorded for a FET device based on a Ti3C2Tx monolayer (Fig. 16.2a, b), which shows a linear Ohmic behavior. Control experiments utilizing four-probe devices showed that the contact resistance does not play a significant role in transport measurements [60]. The average resistivity at gate voltage (VG) = 0 was shown to be 2310 ± 570 /sq., which is comparable to the sheet resistivity of graphene [86]. Since the thickness of the Ti3C2Tx flake is 1 nm [48, 87], the calculated single-flake resistivity is 2.31 ± 0.57 μ m and conductivity is 4600 ± 1100 S/cm [59].\nIt is important to put these data into context and compare transport properties of Ti3C2Tx in different forms. Resistivity measurements conducted on the Ti3C2Tx material from the same batch but in a form of filtered paper revealed resistivity of 15.8 ± 1.3 μ m [59]. The difference between bulk and monolayer flake resistivities may be explained by the contribution of the contact resistance at the interfaces between individual MXene flakes, i.e. the resistance perpendicular to the basal plane. The difference between the resistivities of an individual monolayer Ti3C2Tx flake and a film is within one order of magnitude, which is surprisingly small. In graphite, a stack of 2D sheets of graphene, the resistances perpendicular and parallel to the basal plane differ by three orders of magnitude [88]. In the study of Ti3C2Tx particles [76], the reported resistance anisotropy was also of about one order of magnitude. Moreover, the ratio strongly depends on the mechanical load (stretching or compressing) perpendicular to the basal plane, and comparable in- and out-ofplane resistances can be achieved when Ti3C2Tx layers were pressed to each other [76]. Overall, these results demonstrate a very good interflake conductance through the surface functional groups.\nTransport measurements of monolayer flakes and bulk films even of the same material cannot be compared directly due to the presence of ions and water molecules in the interlayer spacings and the variability of stacking in multilayer particles. Furthermore, a pseudonegative compressibility in Ti3C2Tx clay samples was recently demonstrated [89]. When a mixture of MXene particles and water is quasi-hydrostatically compressed in a diamond anvil cell, Ti3C2Tx MXene expands along its crystallographic c direction, and this expansion persists after the pressure is released. Water molecules forcefully inserted between MXene layers remain trapped and affect transport properties of a bulk material. Thus, it is not surprising that the first conductivity measurements of MXene pressed pellets revealed orders of\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 309\nmagnitude higher resistivity [51] than later observed for freestanding flakes [59, 60], see Table 16.1.\nThe application of an external electric field via the gate electrode changes the conductivity of a flake. As can be seen from Fig. 16.2d, IDS increases with VG, indicating that electrons are major charge carriers. The average Ti3C2Tx fieldeffect electron mobility (μFE) was found to be 2.6 ± 0.7 cm2/ V · s [59]. The distribution of the mobility values for MXene devices is rather narrow compared to other solution-processed 2D materials, such as monolayer rGO sheets [34] and nanoribbons [90], suggesting the structural uniformity of Ti3C2Tx flakes. While at room temperature the mobility is constant at the gate voltages ranging from −60 to 60 V, at temperatures below 200 K, it was shown to be VG dependent [60]. For a Ti3C2Tx device reported by Miranda et al., at VG > 18 V, the mobility was found to be 0.8 cm2/ V · s, while at VG < 18 V it abruptly changed to a lower value of μFE = 0.2 cm2/ V · s; this effect was associated with the multivalley band structure of Ti3C2Tx [60].\nMiranda et al. also measured temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of MXene flakes [60]. Figure 16.2e shows that the IDS–VDS curves obtained at 300 K and 2.5 K are qualitatively similar, although the currents are slightly smaller at the lower temperature. The inset in Fig. 16.2e shows the temperature dependence of the measured sheet resistances at VDS = 0.5 V. The resistance decreases with temperature reaching a minimum at about 250 K and then increases with further decrease in temperature, likely due to the contact resistance effects [60]."

      "heading" : "Comparison of Synthetic Approaches for MXenes",
      "text" : "Electrical measurements of MXenes can also be used to compare efficiencies of different synthetic methods for preparing high-quality MXene materials. The methods for MXenes’ preparation are rapidly evolving, and a number of variations have been already reported for the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx [91]. Similarly to how charge carrier mobility became one of the metrics of graphene’s quality and is often reported to compare a certain method for graphene synthesis with other known approaches, electrical conductivities of individual MXene flakes can be used to compare efficiencies of the corresponding synthetic procedures.\nIn the following example, the electrical measurements of MXene flakes clearly differentiate between two methods for the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 16.3a). In one procedure (Route 1), which was originally reported by Ghudiu et al. [48], Ti3C2Tx was synthesized by immersing Ti3AlC2 powder into a LiF-HCl solution maintaining the molar ratio of LiF to MAX equal to 5:1. Previous studies have shown that this method primarily yields monolayer flakes [48]. In the modified procedure (Route 2), the molar ratio of LiF to MAX was increased to 7.5:1 to provide the excess of Li+ ions for intercalation, and the HCl to LiF ratio was doubled to facilitate etching of aluminum [59]. Other aspects of the original procedure remained identical, except\n310 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nno sonication was needed to delaminate Ti3C2Tx particles that were produced using Route 2 [59].\nMicroscopic characterization demonstrates drastic difference in the quality of Ti3C2Tx flakes produced by Routes 1 and 2 (Fig. 16.3b–g). As can be seen from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, the majority of the flakes produced by Route 1 are 200–500 nm in diameter (Fig. 16.1b), and despite their small size, some of the flakes are not completely exfoliated (Fig. 16.1c). Further characterization of the Route 1 Ti3C2Tx flakes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows uneven edges decorated with tiny dark particles\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 311\n(Fig. 16.1d), which are likely composed of titanium dioxide [83]. TEM images also show that Ti3C2Tx flakes produced by Route 1 exhibit numerous pin holes (Fig. 16.1d). In contrast, Route 2 MXene flakes are substantially larger (4–15 μm in size; Fig. 16.1e) and well exfoliated, as can be seen from the AFM image in Fig. 16.1f, which shows that all Ti3C2Tx flakes are monolayers. While the nominal thickness of a Ti3C2Tx flake is about 1 nm, the increased AFM height (≈2.7 nm in Fig. 16.1f) is associated with the presence of surface adsorbates, such as water molecules, that are trapped under the Ti3C2Tx flake; similar effects have been previously reported for other 2D materials as well [55, 92–94]. AFM measurements of MXene flakes’ thickness will be discussed more in detail in section “Mechanical measurements of Ti3C2Tx flakes”. TEM analysis of Ti3C2Tx produced by Route 2 shows that the flakes have well-defined and clean edges and are visually hole-free (Fig. 16.1g). From this side-by-side comparison, it is clear that the modified synthesis procedure (Route 2) yields Ti3C2Tx flakes of visibly higher quality and larger size compared to the flakes produced using Route 1 [59]. This improvement could be attributed to the change in the composition of the etching solution, which facilitates both etching of aluminum and intercalation of lithium. As a result, multilayer Ti3C2Tx flakes can be delaminated to monolayer flakes by a manual shake, with no need for sonication that shreds flakes into smaller pieces [59].\nImportantly, the microscopic characterization of the Ti3C2Tx flakes produced by Routes 1 and 2 (Fig. 16.3) correlates well with the results of electrical measurements. The metallic conductivity of the Route 2 Ti3C2Tx flakes is illustrated by Fig. 16.2a–d. However, similar devices produced from the Route 1 Ti3C2Tx flakes were not conductive [59]. These results demonstrate that electrical measurements can be used to compare quality of MXene flakes produced by different methods, and also that a thorough optimization of a synthetic procedure is important for manufacturing high-quality and environmentally stable flakes for electronic applications [59]."

      "text" : "Another possible use of electrical measurements of individual flakes of MXenes is to study their environmental stability and oxidation kinetics. It was demonstrated that monolayer MXene flakes cannot sustain prolonged exposure to oxygen in presence of water [83] or at high temperature [84]. For instance, when a colloidal MXene solution in water is exposed to air, Ti3C2Tx flakes are completely oxidized within several days. This results in the solution’s color change from translucent black/brown to cloudy white, with a white precipitate of titania accumulating at the bottom of a vial. The following example shows that the kinetics of the environmental degradation of an individual Ti3C2Tx flake can be studied in situ by measuring the change of FET’s conductivity in air as a function of time [59]. Device measurements have been previously used to study kinetics of other reactions involving 2D materials, such as diazonium functionalization of graphene [95].\n312 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nFigure 16.4a shows the drain–source current in a Ti3C2Tx FET (Fig. 16.2a) that was measured every 10 sec while the device was exposed to air at room temperature and a relative humidity ~50% [59]. Black points at time (t) < 0 correspond to the readings in vacuum before the device was exposed to air. The readings are stable in vacuum but once the device is exposed to humid air, the IDS started to decrease (see red data points in Fig. 16.4), indicating degradation of a MXene flake. However, the IDS decreased by only 18.5% in the span of 70 h, suggesting that high-quality\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 313\nTi3C2Tx flakes (Route 2) are reasonably stable in air even at a monolayer thickness [59]. The device conductivity change upon exposure to air suggests the potential of MXenes for sensing applications, which have been demonstrated in recent studies [66, 67]. Previously, a number of gas sensors have been fabricated using other 2D materials, such as graphene, rGO, and transition metal chalcogenides; which benefit from high surface-to-volume ratios and tunable electronic properties [42, 43, 97–101]. The remarkable chemical and structural diversity of MXenes and their rich surface chemistry [44, 102] make MXene devices very promising for sensing applications.\nAlthough there have not been any detailed sensors studies of individual MXene flakes yet, some recent studies discussed tunable electronic properties of Ti3C2Tx films [66, 67]. While Fig. 16.4a shows the current decay in a Ti3C2Tx single-flake device exposed to air [59], Fig. 16.4b demonstrates a similar experiment performed on a Ti3C2Tx drop-casted film [96]. The figure compares the oxidation rates of a freshly prepared film and the film that was kept in Ar for 6 days prior to exposure to ambient. The apparent current decay rate was ~3 times higher for the freshly made sample compared to an Ar-dried film, indicating that the residual water molecules trapped between the flakes are detrimental for the stability of MXene films. These findings provide means to put the oxidation process under control or conversely utilize it to manufacture MXene–TiO2 composites [96].\nIt is interesting to note that the current decays in a vacuum-dried monolayer Ti3C2Tx exposed to air (Fig. 16.4a) much slower than in an Ar-dried Ti3C2Tx film (Fig. 16.4b). For example, after 25 h of measurements in air the conductivity of a monolayer flake decreased by 8.8% (Fig. 16.4a), while for a film it dropped by 62% (Fig. 16.4b). These observations are consistent with the established importance of residual water for MXene’s degradation, as it should be considerably easier to dry a monolayer flake than a thick film, from which water molecules intercalated between Ti3C2Tx sheets are difficult to remove due to the strong hydrogen bonding with the surface functional groups. Thus, these observations suggest that monolayer flakes could benefit from the improved environmental stability compared to bulk assemblies of MXene sheets.\nWhile oxidation of MXenes is detrimental to their electrical conductivity, it could be purposefully used to engineer new functional properties. Figure 16.4c shows a reversible modulation of current measured in a Ti3C2Tx film under a UV light irradiation [96]. Since the pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene is metallic, the authors propose that the photoresponse is associated with the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles, which formed in Ti3C2Tx films due to oxidation (Fig. 16.4d), and the UV light induces electron transitions from the valence band or defect levels to the conduction band in TiO2 nanocrystals [96]. The slow decay of the photocurrent observed in Fig. 16.4c can be useful for applications in photoresistors and sensors with memory effect. The decay is very sensitive to the atmosphere: inert gases like argon and hydrogen do not affect the photocurrent relaxation after the UV excitation of a Ti3C2Tx-TiO2 composite film (Fig. 16.4e). However, oxygen, humid air, and water vapor significantly accelerate the photocurrent decay (Fig. 16.4f), with water species showing the most pronounced effect [96]. The conductivity photoresponse\n314 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nis reversible, opening possibilities for application of Ti3C2Tx-TiO2 thin films in optoelectronic and environmental sensing.\nHigh electrical conductivity and 2D nature of Ti3C2Tx MXenes could be beneficial for gas sensing applications. Unlike pristine graphene, which is chemically inert and does not have any surface functionalities that could serve as binding sites for gas analytes, MXenes have a benefit of an extensive surface functionalization with chemically diverse moieties (see Fig. 16.4g). Kim et al. demonstrated that gas sensors made of Ti3C2Tx MXene with -OH and -F groups exhibit a very low detection limit of 50–100 ppb for volatile organic compounds at room temperature; see Fig. 16.4g for a gas response to different concentrations of acetone [66]. Gas analytes like acetone, ethanol, ammonia, and propanol at 100 ppb concentration produce high sensor responses of 0.97, 1.7, 0.8, and 0.88%, respectively, while the responses for NO2, SO2, and CO2 are significantly lower (Fig. 16.4h) [66]. These results suggest that Ti3C2Tx sensors have higher responses toward gases capable of hydrogen bonding and that the terminal –OH groups play an important role in the detection of the analytes. Interestingly, unlike 2D semiconductor-based sensors, the Ti3C2Tx sensors display a positive change of resistance for both oxidizing and reducing gases. An important advantage of metallic Ti3C2Tx devices for sensing is high currents and low noise in electrical measurements. Figure 16.4i shows a comparison of electrical noise measurements for different 2D channel materials in the inert N2 atmosphere. Calculated noise levels are approximately 1.5, 1.0, 0.02, and 0.005% for black phosphorus, MoS2, rGO, and Ti3C2Tx, respectively. As a result, Ti3C2Tx sensors exhibit signal-to-noise ratios that are two orders of magnitude higher than that of other 2D materials [66].\nMechanical Measurements of Ti3C2Tx Flakes\nSingle-flake measurements were paramount for the determination of the mechanical properties of 2D materials. Because of its Young’s modulus of about 1 TPa [10], graphene is widely regarded as the strongest material known, which makes it relevant for applications in structural composites, protective coatings, fibers, etc. [13, 14, 33]. The elastic moduli of mechanically exfoliated and CVD-grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2 and WS2, have also been measured and found to be about one third of that of graphene [103–105]. Among other 2D materials, only hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) showed mechanical characteristics approaching graphene [106]. However, it should be recognized that many of the record properties of graphene have been measured on small samples prepared by micromechanical exfoliation, a method relevant for fundamental studies, but not large-scale structural applications. Another limitation of pristine graphene is its poor solubility in conventional solvents, which complicates its processability and miscibility with other materials, such as polymers, for the preparation of composites.\nIn search of other 2D crystals with promising elastic characteristics, it is natural to consider transition metal carbides (TMCs) which exhibit exceptional bulk\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 315\nmechanical properties [107] and are now available in 2D form as MXenes. Several theoretical studies are available on mechanical properties of MXenes [108–112], predicting them to be stiffer than their MAX phase precursors [113] and bulk TMCs [107]. MXene paper and composites have been tested [75], but their properties are determined by weak interfaces.\nRecently, we reported mechanical measurements of the elastic modulus and breaking strength of monolayer and bilayer Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes by the AFM indentation [62]. MXene flakes with lateral sizes up to 10 μm were synthesized by in situ HF etching of aluminum from Ti3AlC2, as described in Refs. [59, 91] (Route 2). These flakes can be deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate with prefabricated 300- nm-deep microwells to produce very clean, tautly stretched Ti3C2Tx membranes (Fig. 16.5a). According to the AFM results, the MXene membranes are stretched across the openings and adhere to the well walls because of the attractive interaction between MXene flakes and SiO2 (see the AFM height profile in Fig. 16.5b). The step height at the edge of the flake shown in Fig. 16.5a is about 3.0 nm (Fig. 16.5c), which includes trapped water molecules between the flake and the substrate. This flake folds at its edge, which adds a layer with the thickness of 1.6 nm in noncontact AFM mode (Fig. 16.5c). While the procedure that we used for the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx provides monolayer flakes at high yields, we also found several suspended bilayer (2L) structures, which consisted of two monolayer flakes overlapping over a well.\nSince the thickness of Ti3C2Tx monolayers is an important parameter for the analysis of the results of nanoindentation experiments, it is necessary to comment on the limitations of AFM for determination of thicknesses of monolayers of 2D materials. For example, while the nominal thickness of graphene is 0.335 nm, in various experiments the AFM measurements of monolayer graphene flakes produced thickness values in the range from 0.4 to 1.7 nm, as summarized in Ref. 114. This inaccuracy could be affected by a number of factors that include the AFM imaging mode (tapping, contact, etc.), tip–surface interactions, presence of various surface adsorbates, and trapped interfacial molecules, among others. Therefore, nominal rather than AFM-measured thicknesses were used in other works on mechanical indentation of 2D materials for calculations of mechanical characteristics [10, 103]. Here, likewise, AFM produced a largely overestimated thickness value of 1.6 nm, and for the Young’s modulus calculation, we instead used the thickness of a Ti3C2Tx monolayer of 0.98 nm, which was determined by atomically resolved TEM and supported by theoretical calculations [47, 87]. It should be pointed out that high-resolution TEM is a preferred method for the determination of the thickness of a Ti3C2Tx monolayer compared to X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. When Ti3C2Tx is produced in a bulk form, XRD could be used to determine the interlayer spacing between the MXene sheets; this spacing can vary considerably depending on the amount and chemical nature of species intercalated between the sheets [48]. However, in a monolayer Ti3C2Tx membrane there are no interlayer spacings with intercalated species, and similarly to AFM, the XRD measurements may overestimate the nominal thickness of a MXene monolayer.\n316 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nThe scheme of the nanoindentation experiment is shown in Fig. 16.5d. The AFM tip was positioned over the center of a membrane and slowly moved downward, providing a controlled stretching of a MXene flake. Two to four cycles of loading and unloading were performed on the same MXene flake with an incremental loading increase of 50 nN (see the corresponding curves in Fig. 16.5e). The\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 317\nextension and retraction curves within each loading cycle as well as the curves for different loads retrace each other, indicating high elasticity of MXene flakes and that no flake detachment occurs during the measurements. The fracture of the 2L Ti3C2Tx membrane shown in Fig. 16.5e occurred at a load force of about 200 nN and a deflection of 38 nm. Even at the maximum deflection, the center of the membrane is far from the bottom of the well that is ≈300 nm deep. The AFM tip punctures the membrane leaving a small hole as seen in the top inset in Fig. 16.5e.\nFigure 16.5f also shows representative force–deflection curves for 1L and 2L Ti3C2Tx membranes. Analysis of the force–deflection dependences using Poisson’s ratio of Ti3C2Tx, v = 0.227 [115], yielded for 1L MXene the E2D elasticity values ranging from 278 to 393 N/m with the average of 326 ± 29 N/m, while for 2L Ti3C2Tx flakes the E2D elasticity values ranged from 632 to 683 N/m with the average of 655 ± 19 N/m (Fig. 16.5g). Both 1L and 2L Ti3C2Tx membranes showed very narrow distributions of the experimental E2D values. The average E2D for 2L Ti3C2Tx membranes is exactly twice that determined for monolayer MXene flakes, suggesting a strong interaction between layers that is likely associated with the hydrogen bonding between the Ti3C2Tx surface groups. Similar effects were observed for overlapping GO membranes [38] and multilayer h-BN flakes [106], where a strong interaction between layers was caused by either hydrogen bonding or interlayer B–N interaction, respectively. In contrast, multilayer graphene exhibits lower E2D than expected from multiplying monolayer E2D by the number of layers due to weaker interlayer interaction and therefore a greater tendency of layers to slide relative to each other upon indentation [10, 106].\nSuspended MXene membranes can be deformed elastically up to a certain stress when mechanical failure occurs. The fracture forces for monolayer MXene membranes ranged from 50 to 102 nN with an average value of Ff = 77 ± 15 nN. As shown in the inset in Fig. 16.5e, the fracture occurred in the center of a membrane where the stress was applied by the AFM tip.\nConsidering that graphene is a benchmark 2D material, it is interesting to compare the force–deflection curves for suspended Ti3C2Tx and graphene monolayers (Fig. 16.5h). The elasticity of graphene determined in work [62] was found to be 341 ± 28 N/m, which is very close to the previously reported values of 340 ± 50 N/m [10].\nThe effective Young’s modulus EYoung and breaking strength σmax can be calculated from E2D and σ 2Dmax, respectively, by dividing them by the membrane’s thickness. As we explained previously, for the Young’s modulus calculation, we used the nominal thickness of a Ti3C2Tx monolayer of 0.98 nm, which was obtained from high-resolution TEM analysis and theoretical calculations [47, 87]; the same approach was utilized in other works on indentation of 2D materials [10, 103]. The effective Young’s modulus for MXene membrane is 333 ± 30 GPa and the breaking strength is 17.3 ± 1.6 GPa (taking the average tip radius of 7 nm). It is interesting to note that according to the molecular dynamics simulations, Ti3C2 has a Young’s modulus of 502 GPa [109]. As expected, the experimentally determined value for Ti3C2Tx of 333 ± 30 GPa is lower because of surface functionalization and presence of defects. However, the difference in the Young’s moduli of the “ideal” Ti3C2 and\n318 A. Lipatov and A. Sinitskii\nthe experimentally realized Ti3C2Tx is not as dramatic as in the case of graphene and GO (1050 GPa versus 210 GPa). This could be rationalized by the fact that surface functionalization has a stronger effect on the mechanical properties of oneatom-thick monolayer graphene compared to thicker Ti3C2Tx flakes.\nComparison of EYoung values for 1L Ti3C2Tx MXene and monolayers of other benchmark 2D materials is presented in Fig. 16.5i. At 330 ± 30 GPa, the effective Young’s modulus of Ti3C2Tx MXene exceeds the previously reported mean values for GO, rGO, and MoS2 that were produced in similar nanoindentation experiments [38, 40, 103], but is lower than those of h-BN and graphene [10, 106]. While the values for graphene, h-BN, and MoS2 were reported for defect-free flakes, the Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes tested here are solution processed. There is a potential to develop methods to synthesize Ti3C2Tx flakes of higher quality to reach a larger Young’s modulus closer to the theoretical value. Additionally, Ti3C2Tx is just one of more than twenty synthesized MXenes, and MXenes with a different number of atomic layers or a different transition metal may have higher elasticity. This study suggests great potential of MXenes for structural composites, protective coatings, nanoresonators, membranes, textiles, and other applications that require bulk quantities of solution-processable materials with exceptional mechanical properties."

      "text" : "We reviewed recent experimental results on electrical and mechanical characterization of MXenes. First, we summarized the electrical measurements of bulk MXene assemblies and demonstrated that the results strongly depend not only on the MXene’s chemical composition and structure, but also on the form of assembly (a pressed disc, a filtered, spin-casted or sprayed film, a particle, etc.), as well as preparation and postprocessing methods and measurement conditions, which dictate the stacking and interflake resistances of individual MXene sheets. These results show the importance of single-flake measurements for revealing the intrinsic properties of various MXene materials and their comparison with each other.\nSingle-flake measurements have been imperative for revealing intrinsic physical properties of various 2D materials, starting with graphene. Importantly, they have been successfully applied to not only micromechanically exfoliated crystals but also solution-synthesized 2D materials, such as rGO, with which MXenes share many similarities. We discussed recent efforts on single-flake measurements of MXenes, which so far have been primarily focused on Ti3C2Tx.\nElectrical measurements of individual Ti3C2Tx monolayers showed their high conductivity of 4600 ± 1100 S/cm, which is higher than previously reported for solution-processed graphene-based materials, and field-effect electron mobility of 2.6 ± 0.7 cm2/ V · s. These measurements were further proved to be useful for comparing the efficiencies of different synthetic methods for preparing high-quality\n16 Electronic and Mechanical Properties of MXenes Derived from Single-. . . 319\nMXene materials and investigating the environmental stability and kinetics of oxidation of Ti3C2Tx flakes in humid air. Interestingly, the data suggest that highquality monolayer Ti3C2Tx flakes benefit from the improved environmental stability compared to bulk assemblies of MXene sheets as they could be more efficiently dried from water, which promotes the air oxidation of Ti3C2Tx.\nMechanical measurements of Ti3C2Tx monolayers revealed their high Young’s modulus of 330 ± 30 GPa, which is currently the highest value measured in nanoindentation experiments of solution-processed 2D materials. These results demonstrate great potential of Ti3C2Tx for applications in mechanically reinforced composites, protective coatings, and nanoresonators.\nThese examples demonstrate the importance of single-flake physical measurements, which will expand our understanding of MXenes and broaden the already impressive range of their potential applications. They should encourage thorough single-flake measurements of other members of the very broad family of MXene materials. Also, as the methods for MXene synthesis will advance, the researchers should get access to MXene flakes with well-controlled surface functionalization, and for such samples single-flake measurements will be crucial to determine the effects of specific functional groups on MXene’s properties. In particular, it would be interesting to compare electrical and mechanical properties of Ti3C2Tx with different surface moieties and, ultimately, without functionalization. For example, in the extensively discussed Ti3C2Tx monolayers a considerable fraction of the nominal thickness of 0.98 nm is occupied by the surface functionalities [87], such as –F and –OH, and thinner flakes of pristine Ti3C2 are expected to have a Young’s modulus approaching the theoretically predicted value of 502 GPa [109]. Monolayer MXene samples without surface functionalization may become available through advancements in solution chemistries or development of CVD methods, which have been recently demonstrated to yield few-layered samples of Mo2C and may be eventually extended to thinner crystals and other transition metal carbides [116]."

      "text" : "Ever since the discovery of graphene in 2004 [1], the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown steadily. Beyond graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, commonly known as TMDs or TMDCs (such as MoS2, WS2, WSe2, MoTe2, etc.) [2], and phosphorene or black phosphorus [3] are particularly notable. Each of these materials exhibits unique characteristics that are reflected in their unusual mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. In a single- to few-layer form, they support distinctly strong light-matter interactions, which can be used as a tool to probe unusual physical processes in such condensed matter systems [4]. Many 2D materials and their heterostructures are excellent candidates for low power, electrically switchable electronic [5], and optical devices [6]. In addition, they provide an excellent platform to enhance light-matter interactions through effective integration with nanophotonic structures and inherent polaritonic resonances [6].\nGraphene contains a single layer of SP2-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a plane in a honeycomb lattice structure. Each “C” atom contains an extra electron in the pz orbital. The orbitals of adjacent atoms overlap and interact giving rise to bonding and antibonding states and the corresponding π-bands in graphene [7]. This results in the linear energy-momentum relation experienced by electrons in graphene. Thus, they behave as massless Dirac fermions [7, 8], leading to a variety\nK. Chaudhuri · Z. Wang · V.

Linearly dispersive Dirac electrons can interact with a broad bandwidth of photon energies [10] strengthening the potential of the material for many optical applications. The Pauli blocking principle leads to a strong saturable absorption [11] and a strong luminescence that can be created and modulated externally [12, 13]. The transmittance of graphene is a function of its fine-structure constant [14], which makes it naturally visible [15] although it is only a fraction of a nanometer thick.\nMonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) consist of a single layer of transition metal atoms placed with a layer of chalcogen atoms on either side, placed in a trigonal prismatic structure. Bulk TMDs are indirect bandgap semiconductors, while the monolayers exhibit a direct bandgap lying in the near-infrared (IR) and visible spectral regions. In addition to a broken in-plane inversion symmetry [16], TMDs exhibit tightly bound room temperature-stable excitons [17–19] and spinand valley-selective electronic and optical properties [16, 20]. Broken inversion symmetry allows strong nonlinear optical processes such as second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), and saturable absorption to exist within the body of ultrathin layers of TMDs [21–23]. Planar photonic and plasmonics are coupled to the strong excitonic systems to realize unique exciton polaritons [24], ultrathin gain material for lasing [25], and even single-photon emitters [26].\nMore recently, black phosphorus (BP) was reintroduced to the optics and electronics community as an anisotropic 2D material [3, 27]. The layer-dependent direct bandgap of BP ranges from 0.3 eV in bulk to 1.5 eV in monolayer form. This bandgap falls in between the gapless graphene and large gap TMDs establishing it as an excellent material platform for near- and mid-IR optics and optoelectronics. Unlike graphene, it has an orthorhombic crystal structure consisting of puckered layers of phosphorus atoms [28]. This also exhibits an anisotropic electronic and optical response with respect to the armchair and zigzag direction of the lattice. The structural anisotropy extends itself to unique anisotropic excitons, electron mobility, optical absorption, thermal conductivity, and plasmons [29–33]. The bandgap, the exciton binding energies, optical absorption spectrum, and linear polarization energy window can be tuned widely by changing the number of layers in a stack of BP. In addition, likewise to other 2D materials, BP exhibits strong saturable absorption-type nonlinearity [34–36].\nMXenes are a relatively new addition to this exciting class of 2D materials which have drawn a great amount of interest due to their tunable properties and wide range of applications [37]. Although discovered 7 years ago, synthesis and isolation of single- to few-layer flakes of MXene are extensively studied and are shown to be scalable, tunable, and processable into variety of solvents in comparison to other extensively studied 2D materials [38] (also see Chap. 5). More than 60 MXene compositions have been predicted with over 20 experimentally synthesized, making them among the fastest growing and the most diverse 2D materials [39]. MXenes with high electrical conductivity [39] have been explored explored in a variety of applications including transparent electrodes [40], metal ion batteries [41], supercapacitors [42–44], and electromagnetic interference shielding [45, 46].\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 329\nUtilizing the optical properties of MXenes, other applications such as effective light to heat conversion [47], saturable absorption for mode-locked lasing [48], surfaceenhance Raman scattering (SERS) [49, 50], plasmonic broadband absorber [51], and photonic diodes [52] have also been demonstrated. However, the most studied MXene, titanium carbide, Ti3C2Tx, has been the material of choice for most of all these studies and optical properties of other MXenes are yet to be investigated.\nIn this chapter, we will overview the theoretical and experimental approaches to study optical properties of MXenes, and discuss some of the optical device demonstrations based on MXenes."

      "heading" : "Theoretical Predictions of Electronic and Optical Properties of MXenes",
      "text" : "In the last decade, a number of groups have focused on the understanding of the physical behaviors of MXenes with the intention integrating them into nanoscale devices [53]. In particular, MXene compounds with Tin + 1Xn (X = C, N and n = 1, 2) were studied extensively in both theory and experiments to understand and predict the characteristics with changing elements, lattice structures, and surface functionalization groups (fluorinated or hydroxylated derivatives). Optical response of materials is intricately related to its structural as well as electronic properties, e.g., band-to-band electronic transitions result in enhanced optical absorption at certain frequencies. Theoretical framework can provide a complete understanding of such potential mechanisms behind material optical response and can also predict behavior of other similar systems. This is particularly useful for the rapidly growing family of synthesized MXenes.\nH. Lashgari et al. have used density functional theory formulation to calculate the density of states (DOS) and band structures, which is used to predict respective optical behavior of single MXene sheet [54]. Electronic properties confirm the metallic nature of most Tin + 1Xn MXenes with their valence and conduction bands overlapping with the Fermi level. The 3D orbital of the Ti in Tin + 1Xn MXenes contributes largely to the metallicity near the Fermi level.\nH. Lashgari et al. made use of the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method [55] and random phase approximation (RPA) formalism [56] to calculate the optical response (complex dielectric function (ε), reflection, absorption, and electron energy loss function) of the two-dimensional Tin + 1Xn MXene compounds such as Ti2C, Ti2N, Ti3C2, and Ti3N2. The imaginary part of the dielectric function, Im ε, is calculated as\nIm ε[interband]ij (ω) = h2e2\nπm2ω2 ∑ n ∫ dk 〈 ψ Cn k |pi |ψVnk 〉 〈 ψ Vn k |pj |ψCnk 〉 δ ( E Cn k − EVnk − ω )\n(17.1)\n330 K. Chaudhuri et al.\nwhere ψVnk corresponds to the occupied valence band levels; ψ Cn k represents the empty conduction band levels over k points of the first Brillouin zone; ECnk and E Vn k stand for the unoccupied conduction band and occupied valence band states, respectively; and ω is the frequency of the interacting electromagnetic wave. Using inverse transformation, the corresponding real part is obtained as\nRe ε[interband]ij (ω) = δij + 2\nπ P ∫ ∞ 0 ω′Imεij (ω) (ω′)2 − ω2 (17.2)\nwhere P is the principal value of the integral. Contributions from the intraband transitions are calculated separately as\nIm ε{intraband}ij (ω) = ω2pl,ij\nω ( ω2 + 2) (17.3)\nRe ε{intraband}ij (ω) = 1 − ω2pl,ij\nω ( ω2 + 2) (17.4)\nwhere ω2p = ne2\nεom (17.5)\nω2p denotes the plasma frequency, n is the free carrier or electron concentration, m is the effective electron mass, and Γ is the damping/loss term in the Drude model. The complete dielectric function with contribution from both inter- and intraband electronic transitions can therefore be written as\nε (ω) = ε{intraband} (ω) + ε[interband] (ω) (17.6)\nMonolayers of Tin + 1Xn (X = C, N and n = 1, 2) contain a hexagonal space group symmetry with three atoms for Ti2X and five for Ti3X2. Due to this symmetry, under the excitation of an electric field parallel (E||x) and perpendicular (E||z) to the c-axis, the complex dielectric function (ε) tensor has only three nonzero components εxx(ω) = εyy(ω) and εzz(ω). Figure 17.1a plots the corresponding dielectric tensors. The peaks in the Im ε has direct contributions from the different inter- and intraband electronic transitions. The real part of the ε, Re ε, is then obtained using the the Kramers-Kronig relations [57, 58], shown in Fig. 17.1a- inset. With the knowledge of the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function, other important optical parameters such as the reflection and absorption can be calculated. The absorption spectrum (A) is proportional to the total contribution of interband transitions from filled valence band states to empty conduction band levels (Fig. 17.1b).\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 331\nThe outermost transition metal atoms of a single layer of MXene were experimentally found to be passivated by functional groups, such as –F, -O, and –OH, due to the synthesis processes as described in Chap. 5. Recent studies have shown that the surface functionalization can largely affect both structural and electronic properties of MXenes [59–61]. It has also been demonstrated that specific attributes of the MXene properties (electron transport, capacitance, etc.) can be tailored by tuning the surface functional groups. A recent work by G. Berdiyorov discussed the effect of the functionalization on the optical properties of Ti3C2T2 MXene, where “T” represents a surface functional group (either –F, -O, or –OH), using computational methods [62]. Here, the susceptibility tensor χ (ω) of the MXene monolayer system is calculated using the well-known Kubo-Greenwood formula [63], often used to calculate electronic conductivity in materials. The frequencydependent complex dielectric properties of the material system are derived from the electric susceptibility as ε (ω) = Re ε + Im ε = 1 + χ (ω).\nReal and imaginary parts of the frequency-dependent dielectric functions were calculated and compared for the experimentally shown functional groups, Ti3C2F2, Ti3C2(OH)2, Ti3C2O2, and pristine Ti3C2 in Fig. 17.2a, c. Considerable variation in the dielectric functions is noted with the variation of the functional groups and spectral range of interest. Using the dielectric functions, the frequency-dependent refractive index, n, and extinction coefficient, k, and absorption spectra have been calculated for Ti3C2T2 (shown in Fig. 17.2b, d). Significant differences between functional groups were observed in the absorption spectra, particularly in the lower photon energy regime, showing the importance of how the surface groups impact eventual properties. The peaks observed agree well with the various inter- and intraband transitions obtained through density functional theory (DFT) predictions reported previously [54, 60].\n332 K. Chaudhuri et al."

      "text" : "MXenes initially were evaluated largely for energy storage applications owing to their 2D structure and ion intercalation properties. However, the growing family of materials is gaining significant attention from the optics and optoelectronics community as well due to their high metallic conductivity [64] and large transmissivity [65] in single- to a few-layer form. This has led to the exploration of MXene-based transparent electrodes [40, 65], photothermal therapy (PTT) [66, 67], and effective electromagnetic interference shielding [45]. More recently, other interesting attributes such as plasmonic properties [51, 64] and large nonlinearities [48, 68] have been observed and implemented in various experimental devices.\nHere, we will be focusing largely on the most well-studied MXene, Ti3C2. It shows high metallic conductivity, down to a single monolayer, and has been investigated for bulk and surface plasmons. Plasmons are collective electron oscillations formed of light-matter interaction [69]. Surface plasmons (SP) are electron oscillations that exist at a metal-dielectric interface at the surface of the metal, whereas bulk plasmons (BP) can form deeper within the body of a free carrier containing system [70].\nIn early investigations of plasmons in Ti3C2 MXene, theoretical and experimental measurements of the electron energy loss function were used. Following the formalism discussed in section 4.2.2, H. Lashgari et al. calculated the electron energy loss function for a single layer of pristine Ti3C2 MXene as in Fig. 17.3a [54]. The interaction of a fast moving electron through a solid may experience an energy loss through mechanisms such as band transitions (inter- and intra-) or excitation of plasmons. The contribution of such interactions can be identified by utilizing electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). V. Mauchamp et al. experimentally\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 333\nmeasured the high-resolution electron energy loss spectra (HREELS) in the energy range of 0.2–30 eV along with an ab initio theoretical framework to demonstrate detectable SPs in nanoscale MXene systems [71]. Results from their calculations are summarized in Fig. 17.3b. Electron energy loss spectra (EELS) was obtained for Ti3C2T2 MXene, with nanoscale multilayered sheets with thickness ranging from 5 nm to 45 nm. The EELS spectra were compared both experimentally and theoretically. In calculations, the surface functionalization (“T”) is assumed to be either exclusively −OH or −F; however, it should be noted that −OH, −O, and −F terminations can be present on the surface of the material as hydrofluoric etching techniques were used. Strong SP modes are observed at very low energy (less than 10 eV) range.\nAs the thickness of multilayered MXene is decreased, reduction in the BP strength is observed, while the intensity of the SP increases significantly (Fig. 17.3b). At low thicknesses, contribution of the surface terms in the total cross section increases, enhancing the SP intensity as shown in Fig. 17.3b (right). The bulk plasmon appears at a much higher energy at which the contribution of the surface terms becomes negligible. In addition, the BP energy (or peak position) is independent of the thickness and the number of MXene layers in a stack as shown in Fig. 17.3b (left). This can be explained by weak interlayer coupling that exists between neighboring layers in a few-layer-thick multilayer Ti3C2T2 stack. In contrast to other 2D materials, such as graphene, h-BN, or TMDs, with increasing layer thickness, electronic band structure and valence band electron densities are modified, resulting in considerable spectral shifts in the BP energy (peak position) [72].\nExperiments reveal the dominance of SP contribution over the BP counterpart for Ti3C2T2 thicknesses up to 45 nm or approximately 45 single-layer sheets of Ti3C2\n334 K. Chaudhuri et al.\n(assuming each Ti3C2T2 layer is ~1 nm). This observation is in contrast to other plasmonic metals, such as aluminum or gold, where the SP vanishes for thicknesses greater than 30 nm, suggesting metallic Ti3C2 exhibits different optical properties in comparison to aluminum or gold [73, 74]. The small value of the SP damping factor (extracted from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian peak fitted to the SP peak in Fig. 17.4a, c), weak interlayer coupling, and lower probability of low-energy SP decay into higher-energy interband transition channels lead to a reduction in bulk plasmon excitation probability and, in turn, a SP dominance in the Ti3C2T2 system (Fig. 17.4b). Thus, SP resonances in MXene can be tuned by altering the electronic structure while controlling the thickness. Electronic band structure of Ti3C2T2 MXene can be modified by the surface functionalization groups “T” added during the synthesis process. Changing the functionalization from –OH to –F, the peak of the interband transition can be frequency shifted, allowing existence of higher-energy SPs.\nAnother study has revealed that the strongly metallic and plasmonic behavior is retained in Ti3C2Tx MXene thin films as well, in contrast to measuring on multilayered stacks of MXene. The films are made of overlapping arrangements of individual single-layer sheets [64]. The experimentally retrieved complex dielectric functions have shown a dielectric to metallic crossover (Re ε falls below 0) at a wavelength of ~1130 nm for MXene films of varying thicknesses (Fig. 17.5a). This further corroborates earlier findings that surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) can be excited in the multilayered MXene at near- to mid- IR frequencies.\nMore recently, MXene films of much higher thickness (~400 nm) have been used as building blocks of plasmonic metamaterial devices. The spectral dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function (ε) were measured (using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer) for the spin-coated Ti3C2Tx films. A dielectric to metallic crossover at ~1.07 μm indicates plasmonic behavior at near-\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 335\nand mid-IR for MXene film thicknesses up to 400 nm [51]. Using a Drude-Lorentz model, optical parameters are extracted (shown in Fig. 17.5b). Optical properties of the thicker MXene films are qualitatively similar to the previously discussed thinner MXene films [64]. Large Im ε or optical losses in the films are attributed in parts to the intrinsic absorption due to interband transitions (at ~5.36 eV (0.23 μm) and ~1.54 eV (0.8 μm)) [54] and to losses stemming from surface roughness and bulk disorder-related scattering of carriers."

      "text" : "So far, there are a handful of experimental demonstrations of optics devices with MXenes. The notable ones include a plasmonic absorber with nanostructured MXenes, mode-locked laser using MXene saturable absorber, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates using MXene sheets.\nPlasmonic resonances in nanostructured Ti3C2Tx MXene have been used to create a simple and easy-to-fabricate metamaterial absorber device [75]. Large absorption over a broad bandwidth (~1.55 μm), covering a significant portion of visible to near-IR spectral window, was obtained by utilizing both the large intrinsic optical absorption and the scattering enhancement of plasmonic resonances of nanostructured Ti3C2Tx at longer wavelengths. Optical scattering characteristics of the Ti3C2Tx nanostructures are evaluated using full-wave three-dimensional (3D) finite element method (FEM) simulations. The optical parameters (transmission, T, and reflection, R) as a function of the wavelength are calculated for Ti3C2Tx MXene\n336 K. Chaudhuri et al.\ndisk/pillar arrays on a glass substrate with varying diameters and thicknesses (Fig. 17.6a). Signature of strong localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance is observed at ~1.26 μm wavelength for disk diameter (d) of 450 nm, thickness (t) of 400 nm, and periodic spacing (P) of 600 nm (shown in cross-sectional electric field maps in Fig. 17.6c). MXene resonators have dielectric like optical properties at higher energies and exhibit signs of weak photonic resonance modes at certain conditions as well. Deeper into near-IR, beyond ~1.8 μm, Ti3C2Tx MXene is more Drude-type metallic and reflects most of the incident photons.\nLosses inherent to the multilayered Ti3C2Tx and existence of LSP resonances in nanostructures make Ti3C2 a suitable candidate for an absorber metamaterial. The absorption (A = 1-T-R) characteristic of a large area array of Ti3C2Tx nanodisks is simulated and plotted as a function of the incident excitation wavelength (λ) in Fig. 17.6b. Structural parameters were optimized to obtain maximum absorption efficiency and bandwidth. An array of Ti3C2Tx disks with d = 450 nm, P = 600 nm, and t = 400 nm sitting on a glass substrate absorbs ~85% of the incident light across 0.4–1.4 μm bandwidth (blue curve in Fig. 17.6b). Absorption in the visible and very near-IR is reported to be originating largely from the inter- and intraband\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 337\ntransitions of electrons [54, 71]. At longer wavelengths, plasmonic resonance aids increased the scattering cross section. Together, these two phenomena create a high absorption efficiency over a large spectral window. The absorption in the patterned disk array shows significant improvement (~2.5 times at ~1.5 μm) when compared to an unpatterned film of similar thickness (Fig. 17.6b).\nCombining MXene with other conventional/well-known plasmonic material components to improve and augment performance has also been explored. An addition of a thin mirror (Au) and dielectric spacer layer (Al2O3) underneath the MXene disk array further enhanced the absorber performance (green curve in Fig. 17.6b). The schematic of a unit cell is shown in Fig. 17.6d (left). The geometrical configuration supported a gap surface plasmon (GSP) resonance that created a strong field confinement in the alumina (Al2O3) spacer layer (crosssectional electric field map in Fig. 17.6d (right)) (at λ ~1.85 μm in this structure) [76]. This mode is formed when a resonator is placed close to metal surface but separated by a nanoscale gap (in a practical scenario, a dielectric spacer layer) [77]. Interaction of SPs on the two adjacent dielectric-metal interfaces and efficient reflection from the ends of the finite dimension resonator on the top surface results into this resonance [78]. This GSP mode attribute can be tuned by the optical properties and thickness of the spacer dielectric, as well as the properties of the top MXene resonator. Optimizing the extended parameter space of this layered hybrid geometry, >90% absorption for incident radiation bandwidth of ~1.55 μm (green curve in Fig. 17.6b) is obtained.\nOptical scattering parameters, e.g., reflection (R) and transmission (T) spectra of the fabricated Ti3C2Tx MXene-based absorber devices, are experimentally measured at different incident angles (20 ◦ –80 ◦ ) and both orthogonal polarizations (TM and TE) (Fig. 17.7a–d). Greater than 80% absorption (A) (calculated as A = 1- T-R) efficiency over 0.4 μm to 1.3 μm is observed for the Ti3C2Tx disk array on glass (blue curve in Fig. 17.7c). For the hybrid design (Fig. 17.6d), similar large absorption (~85%–90%) is obtained, but in addition, the bandwidth is stretched further to ~1.55 μm (green curve in Fig. 17.7c). As compared to an unpatterned MXene film, significant enhancement of absorption throughout the entire bandwidth of operation is demonstrated experimentally. A good qualitative agreement between the experimentally measured curves (~2 times improvement in absorption in the Ti3C2Tx disk array on Au/alumina over an unpatterned film of similar thickness (t) at λ ~ 1.6 μm) with the ones obtained through simulation (Fig. 17.6b) is apparent. The angular dependence of the absorption spectra was recorded for both orthogonal polarizations. The measured absorption spectra for both TE- and TM-polarized excitation match almost perfectly for low incident angles (< ~40◦) as shown in Fig. 17.7d. Large absorption efficiency over the entire bandwidth of interest was maintained for incident angles ranging from 0 ◦ to 65 ◦ in case of TE-polarized incident light (shown in Fig. 17.7e) [51]. In addition to the plasmonic resonances, another significant optical property of 2D MXenes is their large nonlinearities which enable applications in laser science. Controllable optical nonlinearities in different types of materials have led to many interesting phenomena such as second harmonic generation, Kerr\n338 K. Chaudhuri et al.\neffect, optical rectification, four-wave mixing, saturable absorption, etc [79]. Many of these play crucial roles in the development of ultracompact, high-power, and ultrafast femtosecond pulsed laser sources. Femtosecond lasers are of critical importance in field such as advanced micromachining, molecular, chemical, and optical spectroscopy techniques, as well as in information processing. In the past few decades, the development of ultrafast lasers has had tremendous impact on industry and research alike.\nSaturable absorber is one of the key building block of lasers generating highpower, ultranarrow pulses using Q-switching and/or mode-locking methods. In saturable absorbers, the light absorption is modulated with the intensity of the impinged light as α(I) = α0\n(1+I/Is) , where α0 is the linear absorption coefficient, I is the incident intensity and Is is the saturation intensity (defined as the incident intensity at which the absorption coefficient is half of the linear absorption coefficient\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 339\nα0/2. Maximum modulation of absorption coefficient at a specific wavelength of incident radiation for a saturable absorber is termed as the modulation depth. Several 2D materials display outstanding saturable absorption behavior, e.g., increased modulation depth and fast recovery time, and can be beneficial for mode-locking, Q-switching, and pulse shaping in ultracompact lasers.\nRecently, researchers have reported strong saturable absorption behavior in 2D MXenes as well. This was first reported for Ti3CNTx MXene by Y. Jhon et al. (schematic of molecular structure of Ti3CNTx is shown in Fig. 17.8a) [48]. A mode-locked femtosecond fiber-based ring cavity laser was implemented, with a Ti3CNTx MXene stack as a saturable absorber. The generated pulse widths are comparable to the best reported TMD-based saturable absorbers in lasers [48] (Fig. 17.8b). Ti3C2Tx MXene has also been studied for its broadband, nonlinear optical response in the near-IR regime (between 800 and 1800 nm), measured using Zscan measurement technique by X. Jiang et al. (Fig. 17.8c) [68]. The maximum nonlinear coefficient is found to be on the order of 10−21 m2/V2, comparable\n340 K. Chaudhuri et al.\nor even exceeding in magnitude to the values reported for other 2D materials. The calculated effective nonlinear optical absorption coefficient of Ti3C2Tx is two orders of magnitude higher than MoS2 and black phosphorus, indicating an efficient optical switching ability. Peak saturation intensity is extracted to be at a few tens of GW/cm2 for the near-IR spectral range. High-intensity illumination-induced nonlinear refractive index for Ti3C2Tx MXene, measured using an open aperture Z-scan, is also comparable in magnitude (~ −1020 m2/W for the near-IR spectral window) to previous reports on graphene (Fig. 17.8d). When implemented in a fiber-based cavity, the Ti3C2Tx MXene- based saturable absorber generates modelocked, ultrashort (159 fs) duration pulses. The fundamental origin and thickness dependence of the saturable absorption behavior of Ti3C2Tx MXene are further studied by Y. Dong et al. [52]. Open aperture Z-scan measurements on MXene films of varying thickness (5–100 nm) revealed thickness dependence of the modulation depth. This arises from the plasmon-induced increase in absorption at incident energies above the dielectric to metallic crossover frequency after which the free carrier oscillation becomes more favorable. A maximum modulation depth of 50% is measured at incident intensity of 70 mJ/cm2 for a 67-nm-thick Ti3C2Tx MXene, indicating a higher damage threshold than other 2D materials. A Ti3C2Tx MXenebased photonic diode that achieves nonreciprocal transmission of nanosecond laser pulses is demonstrated [52].\nApart from strong plasmonic resonances and nonlinear behavior, MXenes also exhibit a large optical transparency window and strong surface sensitive optical characters. Large transmission coefficient of few-layer stacks of metallic MXenes is promising for applications as transparent electrode materials [40, 65]. The ability to dynamically modulate the transmittance of MXene films by chemical intercalation method enables adaptive device designs [65]. On the other hand, the surface plays a crucial role in determining optical properties (including characteristics of surface plasmons) of 2D MXene (see also section “Theoretical Predictions of Electronic and Optical Properties of MXenes”) making them utile for sensing applications. This has led to demonstration of effective surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates based on MXene sheets either in pristine or in specially synthesized nanoparticle-hybridized form [49, 50].\nRecently, MXenes have been identified for their efficient and tailorable photothermal conversion property and as potential candidates for biomedical applications of photothermal therapy or PTT. In the past, many inorganic substances including plasmonic nanoparticles [80], carbon-based nanomaterials [81], and other 2D materials graphene [82], MoS2 [83], WS2 [84], etc. have been investigated as novel photothermal agents for cancer therapy. And recently, MXene ceramics (such as Ti3C2, Ta4C3, and Nb2C) have demonstrated extraordinarily high efficiency of converting light to heat energy in ultrathin 2D nanosheets [66, 67, 85]. Large absorption of electromagnetic energy in the NIR bio window I (750–1000 nm) and II (1000–1350 nm) causing local hyperthermia can be utilized in vivo and in vitro that can lead to thermal ablation of affected tumor tissue. As an added benefit, MXenes can be synthesized and surface modified to be photothermally stable as well as stable and nontoxic in physiological environment containing many bodily fluids [67, 85].\n17 Optical Properties of MXenes 341"

      "text" : "This chapter provides an overview of the recent advances in the field of 2D MXenes for optics and nanophotonics. The unique optical properties of MXenes have enabled fascinating applications such as ultrafast laser pulse generation, broadband absorber, and SERS. We have placed emphasis on the plasmonic properties of Ti3C2Tx MXenes which enables plasmonic device designs in the near-IR. Although demonstrations of new device concepts have shown the potential of 2D MXenes for optical applications, many challenges remain to be overcome and new opportunities should be explored.\nOne of the main challenges for nanophotonic and plasmonic applications of MXenes is to develop a solid understanding of the optical properties of MXenes, especially the dielectric functions of single- to few-layer MXenes. Even though there have been reports on the band diagrams and the optical properties of monolayer MXenes through density functional theory (DFT) simulations [54, 60, 62], the results are yet to be verified by experimental measurements. This requires fabrication of uniform single- to few-layer MXene films on a large area. Improvements in the optical stability of MXenes flakes, especially for colloidal solutions and single- to few-layer films, are another great challenge. It has been shown that the environmental and chemical stability of single MXene flakes is dependent on the synthesis and processing method, where the overall stability of single flakes in air can be improved from hours to several days [39, 86]. Nevertheless, highly stabilized MXene flakes in longer time periods will provide more reliable device performance.\nThe recent reports on the large nonlinear response and plasmonic behavior of Ti3C2Tx MXene films bring with it further exciting opportunities to explore other members of the MXene family. Even though large nonlinear optical response of MXene films has been observed in a broad wavelength range with z-scan experiments [68], the time dynamics and source of the nonlinearity haven’t been studied yet. Carrying out pump-probe experiments could provide us a deep understanding of the nonlinear process in MXene films [87]. Second, in addition to ultrafast laser pulse generation, MXenes could improve the figures of merit of another important type of laser source, random lasers. It has been theoretically predicted that the exotic optical response of 2D materials could offer new avenues to control random lasers due to the extraordinarily low threshold for saturable absorption [88]. The colloidal solution of single- to few-layer MXene serves as a perfect candidate for the experimental demonstration due to its ease of fabrication [89]. And lastly, due to the larger carrier density, Ti3C2Tx MXene shows plasmonic behavior in the nearIR. This provides the material platform for abundant plasmonic device designs in addition to perfect metamaterial absorber. Overall, considering the multifaceted nature of MXene family and their highly electronic/optical tunability, MXenes have a great potential to be used in nonlinear photonics, optoelectronics, and plasmonics.\n342 K.

      "text" : "Electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors (SCs), are energy storage devices which store energy through (I) electrosorption of charge carrier ions on porous carbon electrode surface – termed as electrical double layer capacitors (EDCLs), as illustrated in Fig. 18.1a, b – and (II) electrode surface or near surface redox reaction/intercalation, termed as pseudocapacitive charge storage, as presented in Fig. 18.1c, d, respectively. Typically, SC electrodes are characterized by rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. 18.1e) and linear galvanostatic charge-discharge plots (Fig. 18.1g), which are different from battery materials that are known to have sharp redox peaks in their CVs and obvious plateaus in their charge-discharge plots, as presented in Fig. 18.1f, h, respectively [1].\nPerformance of SCs is characterized by their energy (W, Joules, but usually expressed in Watt hours) and power (P, Watts).

This set of equations is only applicable to systems that show linear chargedischarge and rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) electrochemical signatures, i.e., when the charge Q (A.s) changes linearly with the potential. Most commonly, the discharged energy is obtained by integrating the potential V (in V) and the current I (in A) during the discharge time t (h) (Eq. 18.3):\nW = ∫ V (t)I (t)dt (18.3)\nAnd the power is the product of the voltage multiplied by the current (Eq. 18.4):\nP = V (t)I (t) (18.4)\n18 MXenes for Supercapacitor Application 351\nThe energy and power values are usually normalized by the weight or volume of the device, or the electrode (it is very important to distinguish between those), to obtain energy and power densities.\nThanks to the highly reversible and fast process of ion electrosorption, EDLCs can deliver high power densities (5–20 kW/kg) with long life spans (>10 years), but EDLCs are limited by energy density (1–10 Wh/kg) when compared to batteries (≈250 Wh/kg). Porous carbon electrodes with high specific surface area (SSA) in the range of 1000–2000 m2 g−1, such as activated carbons, are the materials of choice for EDLCs; these carbons can achieve capacitances up to 150–200 F g−1 and 50–100 F cm−3 in aqueous or nonaqueous electrolytes, respectively. By introducing fast, surface-confined redox reactions, pseudocapacitive materials can provide higher energy density, but this is generally achieved at the expense of the cyclability. Conventional pseudocapacitive materials include – but are not limited to – MnO2, RuO2, and Nb2O5, with capacitance values beyond 500 F g−1. However, they are limited either by the high cost, toxicity, poor conductivity, or electrochemical stability of the materials. Therefore, developing novel electrode materials with superior electrical conductivity, high specific surface area (SSA), and/or involving fast redox reaction/intercalation, combined with attractive costs of production that are free of environmental constraints, are needed."

      "text" : "Beside active materials, the electrolyte is another key component of supercapacitor devices. Typically, electrolytes are categorized into (i) aqueous electrolytes, (ii) nonaqueous electrolytes, and (iii) ionic liquid electrolytes. Aqueous electrolytes – using water as the solvent – are characterized by high ion mobility (up to 100 mS/cm for concentrated acid or base), low viscosity, and low cost; however, the main drawback is the limited electrochemical stability of water which results in a narrow operational potential window of 1.23 V (from thermodynamics). Although some kinetic overvoltage can push this value to 1.5 V, Eq. (18.1) shows that a limited voltage window will translate into a low energy density at the device level. In contrast, nonaqueous or organic electrolytes mainly use acetonitrile (ACN) or propylene carbonate (PC) as solvents. Despite having lower ion mobility, higher viscosity and cost compared to aqueous electrolytes, larger voltage windows up to 3 V can be achieved, which make organic electrolytes very competitive for practical applications. Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are solvent-free electrolytes that are made up of salts that are liquids at room temperature, thanks to their high melting points [6]. RTIL electrolytes can achieve high electrochemical and chemical stability, thanks to the absence of any solvents, resulting in large voltage stability windows (>3 V). However, the relative high viscosity limits the ionic conductivity, as well as low temperature operation since most of RTILs solidify around 0 ◦C. Beyond the conventional electrolytes listed, novel electrolytes such as “solid-statelike” organic electrolytes based on polymers, gels, or ionogels [7–9], redox active\n352 Z. Lin and P.

      "text" : "In 2013, Gogotsi et al. [18] reported the possibility for Ti3C2Tx (Tx stands for the presence of =F, –OH, and =O surface groups) MXene electrodes to reversibly intercalate a large variety of cations (Fig. 18.2a), including Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, and Al3+. Capacitance beyond 440 F cm−3 (130 F g−1) could be achieved, thus challenging the best performance reported for carbon-based SC electrodes in similar electrolytes. The voltammograms in various alkaline and neutral electrolytes show a typical capacitive-like electrochemical signature, that is symmetric, rectangular-shaped CVs without pronounced redox peaks (Fig. 18.2b). Electrochemical quartz-crystal admittance (EQCA) measurements combined with in situ electronic conductance and electrochemical impedance analysis confirm a capacitive-like behavior over a wide range of charging rate in various neutral or alkaline electrolytes, especially when interlayer gaps are filled with ions and water molecules [19]. The fast deformation of partially exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene upon ion intercalation/de-intercalation was also observed.\nFurther studies in acidic electrolytes reported even higher capacitance. As an example, Ti3C2Tx MXene “clay” electrode could achieve up to 900 F cm−3 (245 F g−1) in 1 M H2SO4 without significant degradation after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles [21] (Fig. 18.2c). Such a high capacitance cannot be explained by the sole contribution of the electrical double layer (EDL) since the specific surface area (SSA) of these materials is limited to tens of m2 g−1; as a result,\n18 MXenes for Supercapacitor Application 353\npseudocapacitive contribution from the core Ti3C2 was suspected to be involved. The presence of a pseudocapacitive contribution was later confirmed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements which showed that high capacitance in H2SO4 electrolyte mainly originates from the pseudocapacitive contribution of Ti atoms. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements evidenced a change in the titanium oxidation state during charge/discharge experiments [22]. An in situ Raman spectroscopy study further revealed that the change of oxidation state of titanium was associated with the presence of hydroniums ions (H3O+) in H2SO4 electrolyte that can reversibly bond/debond with oxygen-containing groups present at MXene surfaces, as shown in Fig. 18.3 [23]. The lower capacitance reported in neutral and alkaline electrolytes was then associated with the absence of hydronium ions. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) calculations using ion solvation model and constant-potential Gibbs free energy analysis were used to get further understanding of the surface redox process occurring in Ti3C2Tx in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte [24]. These calculations proposed a charge storage mechanism based on the following reaction:\nTi3C2O q 2 + 2H+ (aq) → Ti3C2O2−2x(OH)q ′ 2x + 2 (1 − x) H+ (aq)\nwhere x is the surface hydrogen coverage (ranging from 0 to 1) and q is the net charge on the electrode. The DFT calculations further confirm the mainly capacitance contribution originates from redox reaction.\nAlthough high capacitance could be achieved in aqueous electrolytes with MXene electrodes, the limited potential range offered by aqueous electrolytes (<1 V) thus results in low energy. In a recent work, the MXene operation potential window could be increased from 0.55 V to 1 V in H2SO4 electrolytes, thanks to the use of glassy carbon or graphite current collectors [25]. This improvement\n354 Z. Lin and P. Simon\nwas ascribed to the kinetic overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on these current collector shifts the redox reaction toward negative potentials. The combination of an enhanced pseudocapacitive contribution at a negative potential range together with the use of MXene electrodes pre-intercalated with electrolyte, ultrahigh volumetric capacitance up to 1500 F cm−3 (370 F g−1) could be achieved, reaching the previously unmatched volumetric performance of RuO2. In addition to the superior capacitance and enlarged potential window, ultrahigh rate performance (210 F g−1 at 10 V s−1) was obtained as well by designing MXene electrodes with tailored macroporous architecture, which surpasses the best performance reported for pseudocapacitive or capacitive electrode materials [25]. This study highlights the great potential of MXene as supercapacitor electrode materials in aqueous electrolytes, and sheds light on the possibility of tailoring the structure of MXene electrodes to further improve their electrochemical performance."

      "text" : "Another key factor that drives the electrochemical performance of MXene electrodes is the surface terminations that are introduced during the chemical etching process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments have confirmed the presence of =O, =F, and –OH terminations on MXenes’ surfaces [26, 27]. Firstprinciple density functional theory (DFT) calculations have predicted there is a significant effect of the presence of these surface groups on the electrical and\nelectrochemical properties of MXenes [17, 28, 29]. The influence of the surface chemistry of Ti3C2Tx on the electrochemical behavior in acidic electrolyte was investigated by Dall’Agnese et al. [30]. By replacing fluorine surface terminations with oxygen-containing functional groups using a chemical treatment in alkaline electrolytes, a fourfold increase in the capacitance could be achieved in sulfuric acid electrolyte. The origin of this improved performance lies in the decrease of the concentration of redox inactive =F groups together with the increase of =O terminations that can reversible bond/debond with hydronium ions in H2SO4 electrolyte [21, 23]. Further studies using 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments have identified and quantified the surface terminations of Ti3C2Tx MXene etched either from LiF-HCl or HF solution [31]. MXene samples prepared in LiF-HCl show the highest O- terminations content, as presented in Fig. 18.4; this explains the higher capacitance of LiF-HCl prepared MXene in H2SO4 electrolyte [21], in agreement with previous studies [23]. Tuning the surface chemistry by hydrazine intercalation into 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene was also reported to decrease the amount of fluorine, –OH surface groups, and intercalated water and result in consequent improvement of the specific capacitance. In summary, =F and – OH surface groups have a negative impact on the capacitance, while = O contributes to the capacitance of MXene in acidic electrolytes through a pseudocapacitive mechanism.\nOther strategies have been investigated to fine-tune the surface chemistry, such as annealing under Argon atmosphere or under vacuum, or by doping with heteroatoms (N). Thermal treatments can be used to control the surface chemistry since, at high temperatures, O atoms will occupy the sites that are mostly occupied by F atoms at room temperature [32]. As an example, K+ intercalation and removal of surface groups by annealing at 673 K under Ar resulted in significantly higher capacitance compared to pristine MXene [33]. Nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene electrodes prepared by MXene annealing in ammonia or polymeric carbon nitride were able to deliver higher capacitances (up to 327 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH\n356 Z. Lin and P. Simon\nelectrolyte) compared to untreated samples (230 F g−1), thanks to the tuning of surface chemistry and structure as well [34, 35]. In addition to the surface chemistry, atomic defects like the presence of Ti vacancies – controlled by the etchant concentration during MXene synthesis – can influence the surface morphology and surface groups, but do not strongly affect the metallic conductivity [36]. A Mo1.33C MXene containing di-vacancies ordering could achieve 65% higher volumetric capacitance (up to 1100 F cm−3) compared to untreated Mo2C; this was explained by the increase of electrochemically active sites, but without direct evidence. As a result, more work is needed to answer some of these fundamental questions [37]."

      "text" : "Moving from aqueous to nonaqueous electrolytes allows for increasing the operating potential window, thanks to the absence of water electrolysis reactions. As a result, MXene electrodes have been extensively characterized in organic electrolytes to further increase their energy density (see Eq. 18.1). Dall’Agnese et al. [38] first characterized MXene/carbon nanotube (MXene/CNT) composite electrodes in 1 M EMI-TFSI1 in acetonitrile and obtained a potential window of 1.8 V together with a capacitance of 80 F g−1 (245 F cm−3). CNTs were used here to limit restacking of the MXene flakes which currently happens for most two-dimensional materials, which results in decreased accessibility of large ions such as EMI+/TFSI− to the interspace between MXene flakes. By using pre-intercalated MXene films with neat EMI-TFSI ionic liquid, Lin et al. [39] demonstrated the possibility of using MXene electrodes in neat ionic liquid electrolytes. A cell voltage of 3 V was achieved together with a capacitance of 75 F g−1 as well as decent power performance, such as presented in Fig. 18.5a. In situ XRD measurements indicated the reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of EMI+ cations at the negative electrode during charge/discharge, while exchange of cations and anions was assumed to occur at the positive electrode [40] (Fig. 18.5b). The volumetric changes of MXenes in contact with different ionic liquids and swelling/contraction during cycling were also observed by complementing electrochemical dilatometry with in situ XRD measurements [41]. The study demonstrated high strains increase with negative polarization while much lower strains are observed during positive polarization, which is explained by a higher population of cations intercalating at negative potentials and less cations de-intercalating or swapping of cations and anions at positive potentials. Such a charge storage mechanism has further been investigated by a molecular dynamic simulation study and the same conclusions were reached: only cation intercalation at negative potentials was observed, while ion exchange occurs at positive potentials in EMI-TFSI ionic liquid electrolyte [42]. These studies first suggest the important effect of MXene layer distance for especially large\n1Ethyl-methyl-imidazole, tri-fluoro-sulfonyl-imide\n18 MXenes for Supercapacitor Application 357\nions intercalation. However, these results also highlight the key issue of MXene as electrode material in nonaqueous electrolytes, which is the limited capacitance these materials can achieve in nonaqueous electrolytes (around 80–100 F g−1), which is three to four times less than in acidic electrolytes. This points out the key role of water molecules, protons, and hydronium ions which are now known to be needed to activate the redox pseudocapacitance on the transition metal [43]. In aprotic, nonaqueous electrolytes, most of the capacitance is assumed to come from the double layer charging with no – or minor – charge transfer on the transition metal atoms of MXenes. Because of these limitations, only few examples of MXene-based supercapacitor using nonaqueous electrolytes have been proposed, while MXenebased batteries or metal ion capacitors [44] which use nonaqueous electrolytes as well have been extensively studied, which will be detailed in other chapters in this book.\nAs a result, one of the main challenges in MXene – if not the main one – will be in the next years to find strategies to unlock the redox activity of the transition metal to combine both high capacitance and high cell voltage. If successful, such an approach could lead to a major breakthrough in the supercapacitor industry."

      "text" : "Many MXene-based composite electrodes have been investigated, aiming at increasing electrochemical or mechanical performance [38, 45–54]. For instance, graphene or CNTs were added to Ti3C2Tx MXene to avoid the restacking issue of the 2D flakes, which was successful for increasing electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and electrolyte ion accessibility to MXene surface [38, 53, 55–57]. Free-standing and flexible sandwich-like MXene/carbon nanotube (CNT) paper was reported with high volumetric capacitances in 1 M MgSO4 aqueous electrolyte [55].\nThe same route was followed to enhance the accessibility of MXene surface to large size cations and anions, especially for organic electrolytes or even ionic liquid electrolytes [38]. Also, polypyrrole (PPy) was used as well to produce PPy/Ti3C2Tx MXene composite electrode, as shown in Fig. 18.6. Pyrrole was in situ polymerized and confined between Ti3C2Tx layers, resulting in high volumetric capacitance and excellent cyclability due to the improved electronic conductivity and better ion transport pathways [50, 54]. Metal oxides including TiO2 [58, 59], ZnO [60], MnO2 [61, 62], Nb2O5 [63], and MoO3 [64] have also been used to synthesize MXene-based composite electrodes [53, 61]. For instance, ε-MnO2 nanocrystalline whiskers were directly chemically synthesized on MXene nanosheet surface to make nanocomposite electrodes for preparing high capacitance, aqueous-based supercapacitors."

      "text" : "Although MXenes exhibit great potential as supercapacitor electrodes, especially in acidic electrolytes where extremely high volumetric as well as gravimetric capacitance have been reported, practical applications of symmetric MXene-based supercapacitor devices are limited by their narrow voltage ranges. This is partially due to water electrolysis, but the low oxidation potential of MXenes is a major factor. For instance, oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte starts at about −0.1 V (vs. Hg/Hg2SO4) [25]. Therefore, MXenes can be used as a negative electrode in hybrid devices, in combination with a positive electrode operating in a potential range located beyond −0.1 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4. Generally, a hybrid supercapacitor combines a capacitive activated carbon electrode together with a\n18 MXenes for Supercapacitor Application 359\nfaradic (pseudocapacitive or battery-like) electrode. Such a cell design comes with an increase in capacity and cell voltage compared to symmetric carbon devices resulting in improved energy density versus EDLCs. Apart from activated carbon, various materials such as rGO [65], annealed-MXene-nickel oxide [66], RuO2 [67], and carbon nanofiber films [68], have been investigated as positive electrodes together with MXene [69]. Kim et al. [66] prepared a composite electrode based on NiO-grown derived-TiO2/C-Ti3C2Tx MXene nanocomposite (Ni-dMXNC) with a volumetric capacity of 60.7 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, which demonstrates a voltage window of 1.8 V when combined with a Ti3C2Tx MXene negative electrode. Recently, RuO2 was proposed as a positive electrode because of its high conductivity, large proton-induced pseudocapacitance, and high overpotential for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Working with a Ti3C2Tx MXene negative electrode coated onto a carbon fiber current collector [25, 67], the prepared hybrid device can operate within a voltage window of 1.5 V, which is about two times wider than the operating voltage window of symmetric MXene supercapacitors, with a capacitance of 93 F g−1 (Fig. 18.7). It’s believed that more hybrid supercapacitor systems with various positive electrodes including capacitive electrodes and battery electrodes will be investigated to further boost up the energy density and/or power density. Here also, the successful development of highly capacitive MXene electrodes operating in nonaqueous electrolyte would be a major breakthrough. Interestingly, recent results have shown the possibility for MXene electrodes to achieve high capacitance in Liion containing non-aqueous electrolytes and this gives strong hope for the successful development of this technology [70].\nIn order to meet the demands for safer energy storage systems to power portable or wearable electronic devices and flexible displays, all-solid-state supercapacitors and micro-supercapacitors are currently being developed [71]. Taking advantage of the high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance along with metallic\n360 Z. Lin and P. Simon\nconductivity, MXene-based electrodes have been assembled into all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) for on-chip energy storage [51, 69, 72–76]. As shown in Fig. 18.8, an all-MXene solid-state MSC was fabricated by spray-coating a first thin layer of Ti3C2Tx onto a glass substrate as the current collector, followed by the coating of a second electroactive Ti3C2Tx film. Laser scribing was then used to prepare an interdigitated supercapacitor cell which was further soaked with a PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte. This device could deliver an areal capacitance of 28 mF cm−2 that is five times improvement compared to advanced porous carbon-based symmetric MSCs (0.1–6 mF cm−2) [72]. Recently, Zhang and co-workers reported a 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene viscous ink which can be stamped into flexible, coplanar MSCs [76]. Different stamp shapes were prepared by a 3D-printing process, coated with MXene ink and then firmly pressed onto paper substrates. Moreover, dozens of stamped MSCs can be fabricated in seconds through such a facile, low-cost, but elegant stamping strategy. Despite the progress achieved, more attention should be paid to MXene-based MSCs to further boost energy and power performance.\n18 MXenes for Supercapacitor Application 361"

      "heading" : "Conclusion",
      "text" : "So far, MXenes have been mainly investigated in aqueous electrolytes, where the capacitance achieved outperforms most of the carbon-based materials and pseudocapacitive materials. For instance, values as high as 1500 F cm−3 and 370 F g−1 were achieved for a Ti3C2 MXene electrode in acidic electrolyte, due to the fast and reversible redox reactions involving protons/hydronium ions. Although various in situ techniques like X-ray diffraction/adsorption, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) in gravimetric and dissipative modes or NMR combined with MD and DFT modeling have been used to explore the charge storage mechanism of MXene electrodes in aqueous electrolytes, more efforts are still needed to provide a full picture of the charge storage mechanism. With the purpose of boosting the energy density, few efforts are trying to move from aqueous to nonaqueous electrolytes which offer higher operating voltage. All these efforts are still to this day unsatisfactory due to the low volumetric and gravimetric capacitance achieved by MXene in these proton-free electrolytes, where there is an absence of redox pseudocapacitive behavior as well as the limited surface accessibility to the large ions. To further improve the electrochemical performance, strategies such as surface chemistry modification, 3D porous structures, or composite MXene electrode designs have been developed to either introduce a redox contribution or improve surface accessibility to ions. Special interest should go toward unlocking the redox activity of the MXene transition metal in nonaqueous electrolytes to combine both high capacitance and high cell voltage. The successful development of these approaches would provide guidance for developing the next generation of MXene-based supercapacitors."

      "text" : "A crucial requirement of sustainable power grids is a wide distribution of electrochemical energy storage devices in a power grid, which balances uneven energy demands and intermittent power generated from renewable sources, improving our energy control and operational efficiency. Thus, we must develop high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices such as batteries [1].\nLithium-ion batteries are used mainly for portable electronics because these batteries have relatively high gravimetric/volumetric energy densities (200–250 Wh/kg and 500–600 Wh/L, respectively). However, these batteries do not have satisfactory energy densities for larger applications such as electric vehicles. Because the energy density of a battery depends partly on its electrode materials, a major challenge in battery research is to find electrode materials with better specific capacity, operating potential, rate capability, and cycle stability. Recently, MXenes have attracted attention as potential lithium-ion battery electrodes (section “Application to Lithium-Ion Batteries”), because their layered structure enables reversible Li+ (de)intercalation, while their compositional versatility enables optimization of electrochemical properties [2].\nAnother important requirement for advanced grid-scale batteries is elemental abundance and low cost. Because lithium is distributed poorly across the world, making it expensive, we must develop batteries that consist of more-abundant elements.

      "text" : "Before summarizing the battery applications of MXenes, let us first consider the charge storage mechanism of MXene [4]. Figure 19.1 illustrates the charge storage of stacked MXene and delaminated single-layer MXene electrodes. For both cases, the specific capacitance (C) of the MXene electrode is defined as C = Q\n(ϕcc−ϕb) , where (ϕcc − ϕb) is the change of the inner potential difference between a current collector (ϕcc) and a bulk electrolyte (ϕb), and Q is the stored charge per unit weight of the electrode. (ϕcc − ϕb) is equivalent to the voltage change of an electrochemical cell when a reference electrode is used.\nϕcc − ϕb is expanded by the inner potential differences as\nϕcc − ϕb = ( ϕcc − ϕeE ) + ( ϕe E − ϕiE ) + ( ϕi E − ϕb ) .\nThe equilibrium condition of the electron electrochemical potential μe between the current collector and the electrode material (MXene) applies to give\nμcce = μEe ,\n19 MXenes for Batteries 369\nwhich leads to\nμe cc–Fϕcc = μeE–FϕeE.\nThe equilibrium condition of the ion electrochemical potential μi between the electrode and electrolyte also applies to give\nμi E = μib,\nwhich leads to\nμi E + FϕiE = μib + Fϕb.\nThus,\nϕcc − ϕb = μ cc e − μEe\nF +\n( ϕEe − ϕEi ) + μ b i − μEi\nF .\nBecause μcce and μ b i are constant regardless of the state-of-charge of the electrode,\n(ϕCC − ϕb) is expressed as\n(ϕcc − ϕb) = ( ϕEe − ϕEi ) − ( μEe + μEi ) F .\nIf, as is true for aqueous electrolytes, the density of states of the electrode is much larger than the number of stored electrons, then μEe is almost constant during charging and discharging, so μEe = 0. Also, if the electrode has much more cation storage sites than stored cations, then μEi will be almost constant during charging and discharging, giving μEi = 0. Thus, (ϕcc − ϕb) = ( ϕEe − ϕEi ) applies for small Q, and the electrode will behave as an electric double-layer (EDL) capacitor. Hydrated-ion intercalation into the interlayer space was confirmed using the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) method [5]. The specific capacitance (C) for non-delaminated multilayer MXene (Fig. 19.1a) is C = εrε0A\nb−a , where εr is the dielectric constant between the MXene wall and ion, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, A is the specific surface area of the MXene walls, 2b is the separation of the MXene walls, and a is the ionic radius [6]. Indeed, Ti2CTx and Ti3C2Tx with aqueous electrolytes exhibit rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. 19.2a, c), typical of EDL electrodes. Note that, when the EDL is formed, the stored electrons occupy originally unoccupied electronic states, reducing the MXene.\nConversely, when the electrode is charged/discharged with nonaqueous electrolytes, desolvated ions are intercalated to induce orbital hybridization with surface termination groups (charge transfer). The charge transfer strongly screens the electric field between the electron and the cation, which reduces the contribution of (ϕeE − ϕiE) to the capacitance. More importantly, because the organic electrolytes\n370 M. Okubo and A. Yamada\nhave a wide potential window, many electrons and cations are stored during charging, and μeE and μiE change significantly due to band filling and inter-cation interaction. These effects presumably distort the CV curves for Ti2CTx and Ti3C2Tx with nonaqueous electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 19.2b, d This is the situation where the MXene electrode behaves as a pseudocapacitor (or redox capacitor). For the limiting case where the electric field in the electrode is completely screened by sufficient charge transfer and the inner potential is uniform (ϕeE = ϕiE), the applied potential difference is described only by the change in the chemical potentials of electron and ion as an ion-intercalation or ion-adsorption reaction. Desolvated-ion intercalation into the interlayer space has been demonstrated for Na+ using TEM and NMR [7, 8].\nWhen an electrode consists of delaminated single-layer MXenes, the structural changes should only slightly change μeE and μiE, and a band-filling effect, intercation interaction, and MXene-cation interaction could dominate the capacitance.\n19 MXenes for Batteries 371"

      "text" : "MXene was first used as a negative electrode material for lithium-ion batteries by Naguib et al. in 2012 [9]. The electrochemical properties of non-delaminated Ti2CTx synthesized by hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment were evaluated in 1 M LiPF6/ethylene carbonate (EC)-diethyl carbonate (DEC). As shown in Fig. 19.3, after a large irreversible capacity in the first charge (an initial coulombic efficiency of 45%), Ti2CTx delivers a specific capacity of 150–200 mAh/g at a C/10 rate (~20 mA/g) with good capacity retention. The sloping potential profile between 0 and 2.0 V vs. Li/Li+ is typical of capacitor electrodes, although Li+ (de)intercalation occurs upon (dis)charge. The same group, led by Gogotsi and Barsoum, also reported the electrochemical properties of non-delaminated Nb2CTx and V2CTx in a nonaqueous Li+ electrolyte [10]. Despite the different transition metals, both MXenes showed specific capacities of 210–220 mAh/g with sloping potential profiles, similar to those observed for Ti2CTx. However, the reaction voltage of V2CTx was slightly higher than that of Ti2CTx, presumably because band filling affected μeE: the 3d orbital energy of V in V2CTx should be lower than that of Ti in Ti2CTx. Table 19.1 summarizes the applications of MXenes to Li-ion batteries [11–20]. Most non-delaminated MXene electrodes have relatively low initial coulombic efficiency (60–70%), presumably because the large surface area of the partially delaminated structure causes deteriorative side reactions such as electrolyte decomposition and surface reaction.\nMost non-delaminated MXenes exhibit a charge/discharge reaction of 1.0–2.0 Li+ per the formula unit (Table 19.1). These capacities are less than expected for the one-electron capacity per transition metal in the formula unit. It is presumed that the specific capacity of MXene is limited by the number of Li-ion storage sites in the interlayer space. Indeed, when Ti3C2Tx is delaminated, e.g., by DMSO intercalation\n372 M.

However, though the delamination increases the specific capacity, the increased surface area produces a larger irreversible capacity in the initial charge, worsening the coulombic efficiency (ca. 45–55%) (Fig. 19.4).\nThe functionalization of MXene has further increased the specific capacity of MXene electrodes. For example, anchoring the “Sn4+ nanocomplex” (most likely amorphous SnO2) on the surface of non-delaminated Ti3C2Tx accumulates additional capacity of the conversion reaction of SnO2, delivering a specific capacity of 1500 mAh/g at 100 mA/g [16]. Similarly, cobalt-ion intercalated V2CTx exhibits a large capacity of 1117 mAh/g [21]. However, the initial coulombic efficiency decreases after functionalization due to the well-known irreversibility of conversion reactions."

      "text" : "The electrochemical properties of MXene in sodium-ion cells were reported by Xie et al. in 2014 [22]. Non-delaminated Ti3C2Tx synthesized by HF treatment was evaluated as the electrode material in a 1 M NaClO4/EC-PC electrolyte; after an initial irreversible charge capacity (coulombic efficiency of 50%), Ti3C2Tx delivers a specific capacity of 100 mAh/g at 100 mA/g with sloping charge/discharge potential profiles. More detailed analyses of the electrochemical reaction of nondelaminated Ti3C2Tx revealed the following: (1) initial sodiation expands the\ninterlayer distance by 3.0 Å; (2) Na+ is reversibly intercalated/deintercalated during charge/discharge; (3) the interlayer distance does not change after the initial expansion [7]. Similar behavior has been reported for non-delaminated Ti2CTx, though it has a larger specific capacity of 180 mAh/g at 20 mA/g (Fig. 19.5) [23]. It is most likely that the co-intercalation of both Na+ and solvent molecules occurs, expanding the interlayer distance during initial sodiation, which improves the ability of Na+ to access the interlayer space [7]. Indeed, the non-delaminated Ti3C2Tx electrode can deliver a high specific capacity of 70 mAh/g even at a high specific current of 500 mA/g [7]. Table 19.2 summarizes the applications of MXenes to sodium-ion batteries [7, 8, 22–29]. For example, V2CTx and Hf3C2Tx, other non-delaminated MXenes were reported to give specific capacities of 80 mAh/g at 10 mA/g and 800 mAh/g at 50 mA/g, respectively. As summarized in Table 19.2, except for an exceptionally large capacity for Hf3C2Tx, non-delaminated MXenes usually deliver 100–200 mAh/g with an initial coulombic efficiency of 40–65%.\nNon-delaminated MXenes in nonaqueous Na+ electrolytes usually have smaller specific capacities than nonaqueous Li+ electrolytes: non-delaminated MXenes generally exhibit a reaction of <1.0 Na+ per formula unit. Because μeE is the same for lithiation and sodiation, this capacity difference should result from the difference in μiE such as from inter-cation coulombic or MXene-cation interaction. Presumably, the interlayer space of MXene cannot accommodate large Na+ efficiently. Indeed, delaminated and functionalized MXenes show higher sodiation capacity. For example, 3D macroporous electrodes consisting of delaminated MXenes (Ti3C2Tx, V2CTx, and Mo2CTx) were fabricated using a poly(methyl methacrylate) spherical template [27]. After annealing at 450 ◦C, they delivered specific capacities of 330–370 mAh/g at 50 mA/g, much larger than reported for non-delaminated MXenes. The specific capacity of delaminated Ti3C2Tx also increased to 500 mAh/g by combining it with the conversion-reaction capacity of Sb2O3 [28].\n19 MXenes for Batteries 375\nTa bl\ne 19\n.2 Se\nle ct\ned pe\nrf or\nm an\nce of\nM X\nen es\nin N\naio\nn ce\nlls\nM X\nen e\nD el\nam in\nat io\nn Fu\nnc tio\nna liz\nat io\nn E\nle ct\nro de\nco m\npo si\ntio n\n2n d\nca pa\nci ty\n[m A\nh/ g]\n1s tc\nou lo\nm bi\nc ef\nfic ie\nnc y\nR ef\nT i 2\nC T\nx (H\nF) −\n− PV\nD F/\nA B\n18 0\nat 20\nm A\n/g 65\n% [2 3] T i 3 C 2 T x (H F) − − C B ~1 00 at 10 0 m A /g ~5 0% [2 2] T i 3 C 2 T x (H F) − − N aA lg /M W C N T ~1 40 at 25 m A /g ~4 5% [8 ] T i 3 C 2 T x (H F) − − PV D F/ A B 12 0 at 20 m A /g 54 % [7 ] T i 3 C 2 T x (H F) − 6 M K O H PV D F/ C B ~1 60 at 20 m A /g ~5 5% [2 4] T i 3 C 2 T x (L iF /H C l) So ni ca tio n − C N T ~1 50 at 20 m A /g ~3 5% [2 5] T i 3 C 2 T x (H F) D M SO − C M C /A B ~2 10 at 10 0 m A /g ~4 5% [2 6] T i 3 C 2 T x (L iF /H C l) D M SO /s on ic at io n H ol lo w sp he re /4 50 C − ~3 30 at 50 m A /g ~7 0% [2 7] T i 3 C 2 T x (L iF /H C l) So ni ca tio n Sb 2 O 3 C M C /C B ~5 00 at 50 m A /g ~6 0% [2 8] V 2 C T x (H F) − − PV D F/ A B ~8 0 at 10 m A /g ~5 0% [2 9] V 2 C T x (H F) T B A O H /s on ic at io n H ol lo w sp he re /4 50 C − ~3 40 at 50 m A /g ~6 5% [2 7] M o 2 C T x (L iF /H C l) T B A O H /s on ic at io n H ol lo w sp he re /4 50 C − ~3 70 at 50 m A /g ~7 0% [2 7] H f 3 C 2 T x (H F) − − PV D F/ Su pe r P ~8 00 at 50 m A /g ~4 0% [3 0]\nP V\nD F\npo ly\nvi ny\nlid en\ne flu\nor id\ne, A\nB ac\net yl\nen e\nbl ac\nk, N\naA lg\nso di\num al\ngi na\nte ,\nM W\nC N\nT m\nul tiw\nal le\nd ca\nrb on\nna no\ntu be\n, C\nB ca\nrb on\nbl ac\nk, D\nM SO\ndi m\net hy l su lf ox id e, C N T ca rb on na no tu be ,C M C ca rb ox ym et hy lc el lu lo se ,T B A O H te tr ab ut yl am m on iu m hy dr ox id e\n376 M.

For example, Gogotsi et al. theoretically predicted the electrode performance of MXenes (Ti2CTx, V2CTx, Nb2CTx, and Ti3C2Tx) with K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+ [18]. For MXenes with Tx = −O2, the MXene electrodes were predicted to deliver specific capacities of 200–300 mAh/g by monovalent cation adsorption (Fig. 19.6) [22]. Note that the predicted capacity decreases as the ionic radius of the monovalent cation increases. Indeed, the charge/discharge experiments confirmed that the specific capacity of Ti3C2Tx decreases in the order of Li+, Na+, and K+ [31].\nMXene electrodes have been predicted to deliver much larger capacities by adsorption of divalent and trivalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) than by adsorption of monovalent cations. For example, a V2CO2 electrode was predicted to deliver a specific capacity of 530 mAh/g by Al3+ adsorption (Fig. 19.6). However, non-delaminated V2CTx in an Al3+ ionic liquid electrolyte delivered a reversible capacity of less than 150 mAh/g [32]. Though delamination improved the capacity to 200 mAh/g, the measured capacity was much smaller than the predicted value. Similarly, the intercalation of a cetyltrimethylammonium cation into Ti3C2Tx enables Mg2+ storage of 90 mAh/g at 50 mA/g, much smaller than the predicted value of 420 mAh/g [33].\n19 MXenes for Batteries 377"

In particular, using nonaqueous electrolytes, with their large electrochemical windows, allows for MXene electrodes with large capacity. Furthermore, delaminating MXene nanosheets significantly increases their specific capacity by enlarging their reactive surface area.\nHowever, due to the exfoliated nanosheet morphology even for non-delaminated MXenes, all MXenes (non-delaminated and delaminated) show large irreversible capacity in the initial cycle, leading to poor initial coulombic efficiency, generally less than 60%. One promising approach to improve their initial coulombic efficiency is to control the surface states of the MXenes. For example, heat treatment of Ti3C2Tx appears to modify its surface state and improve its initial coulombic efficiency from 45% to 57% (with nonaqueous Li+ electrolytes) [34]. Alternatively, suppressing the excess formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase by optimizing the electrode-electrolyte system should also improve their initial coulombic efficiency.\nAnother important issue is the electronic conductivity of MXenes. Though many reports claim that MXenes have high electronic conductivity, MXene electrodes are usually prepared with conducting carbon additives to improve their conductivity (Tables 19.1 and 19.2). For high-power applications, we must find a way to develop highly conductive MXenes, such as by doping with aliovalent or hetero atoms."

      "text" : "A clean energy revolution is underway that includes harnessing renewable energy sources such as wind and solar and beginning a switch to electric vehicles, in an effort to curb CO2 emissions and mitigate urban air pollution. Effectively integrating renewable energy sources calls for electrochemical energy storage devices that embrace low cost and high energy density as well as long cycle life. The market has been – and continues to be – dominated by Li-ion batteries that use lithium transition metal oxides to store electrical energy by a process known as intercalation chemistry. While the latter fundamentally limits their electron storage capacity and hence energy density [1], the cost and availability of some of those metals, such as cobalt, are also a rising concern. Exploration of new electrochemistries that go “beyond lithium-ion” to boost energy density and reduce cost is rapidly gaining momentum. In this pursuit, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries that couple sulfurpositive electrodes (or “cathodes”) with lithium-negative electrodes (or “anodes”) are considered particularly promising candidates. The Li-S battery has received enormous attention in the past decade, due to the high theoretical specific energy (Wh kg−1) and earth abundance of sulfur, which is coupled with a high-energy density Li metal anode in the cell [2–5]. Instead of intercalation chemistry, these batteries rely on conversion chemistry, as summarized by the reaction below, that\nX.

The redox chemistry proceeds through lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates consisting of Li2Sx chains, reaching the end member, Li2S where x = y = 1 (Fig. 20.1a) [6]. Fundamental challenges facing Li-S batteries originate from the dissolution of these highly mobile lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte, the intrinsic insulating properties of the redox end members (elemental sulfur/lithium sulfides), the volume changes at the cathode on cycling, and the need for passivating membranes at the lithium anode to inhibit dendrite formation. In particular, the soluble polysulfide species create a “polysulfide shuttle” in the cell (Fig. 20.1b), which decreases the sulfur utilization and Coulombic efficiency, while the insolubility of Li2S and/or Li2S2 results in the precipitation of passivating solids on both the cathode and anode [7]. Moreover, it is now widely realized that high areal sulfur loading in the cathode is essential for Li-S technology to gain a foothold in the marketplace [8, 9]. In such cells, the challenges listed above are greatly amplified due to the difficulties in creating a continuous electron/Li+ pathway in thick cathodes and protecting the anodes from LiPS corrosion and dendrite formation at high current rates.\nInfiltrating molten sulfur into porous electronically conductive carbon materials to form the cathode was the standard approach in the early years [5, 10–12],\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 383\nresulting in interconnected conducting networks and physical entrapment of the LiPSs. However, simple entrapment was found insufficient to prevent diffusion and shuttling of LiPSs over long-term cycling. Interfacial phenomena – strong chemical interaction between the host materials and the dissolved LiPSs – are essential to suppress LiPS diffusion and thus achieve a long cell life time [6]. This was demonstrated by employing a variety of sulfur host matrices such as reduced graphene oxides (rGO) [13], nitrogen-doped carbon [14], metal oxides [15, 16], and chalcogenides [17, 18] and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [19] to accomplish the task. The key factor of these host materials lies in their ability to bind sulfide or lithium ions in the LiPS molecules, providing affinity for LiPSs. However, many do not fulfill properties that are also critical to cathode design, such as sufficient mechanical stability to maintain electrode integrity over long-term cycling and high electronic conductivity which is especially necessary for electron transport in thick, high areal loading electrodes.\nHere, MXenes can provide a vital role. Delaminated MXenes are capable of high electronic conductivity and exhibit rich surface properties [20], which synergistically improves the electron transport properties of the sulfur electrode and provides chemical interactions with LiPSs. Another advantageous aspect is their denser structure compared to most “fluffy” carbonaceous materials, which benefits the volumetric energy density of the battery. The goal of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the recent development of MXenes for Li-S batteries, from material aspects on tuning the physical and electrochemical properties of the sulfur cathode, to their performance in prototype cells. Different mechanisms of chemical interactions with polysulfides are summarized. Finally, a perspective of MXenes and their composites for future advances toward practical Li-S cells is provided."

      "text" : "MXenes are an exciting family of early transition metal carbides or carbonitrides first reported by Gogotsi et al. in 2011 [21]. They are produced by selective etching (in aqueous hydrofluoric acid, HF) of the A element from the MAX phases [22], named because of their composition Mn+1AXn, where M is an early transition metal, A is a group IIIA or IVA element, X is C and/or N, and n = 1–3 [23]. Delamination of the sheets is affected via solvation by donor solvents [24]. The sheet surface is terminated with groups such as hydroxyl, oxygen, or fluorine, which impart hydrophilicity to the surfaces (denoted as Mn+1XnTx, where T represents the surface termination). These surface properties are one reason why MXenes have found application in Li-S cells. As mentioned above, a recent techno-economic analysis suggests that Li-S cathodes with areal sulfur loadings of >7 mg cm−2 (and low electrolyte volume) are necessary for the batteries to find practical applications in transportation [8]. The poor sulfur utilization in thick electrodes (with high areal loading) is due to the significant differences in the mass transport and spatial distribution of polysulfides throughout the electrode. This leads to limited diffusion\n384 X. Liang and L. F. Nazar\npathways, kinetics, and electrolyte uptake to support high current densities [6].

The reverse occurs on charge. Moreover, sulfur exhibits a large volume expansion (~80%) upon conversion to Li2S [15]. These phase transformations pose big challenges to maintaining the structural integrity of the electrode. Thus, one requirement for a robust sulfur host is mechanical strength (Fig. 20.2a). Benefiting from a strong covalent M-X bond, MXenes show remarkable flexibility, good tensile, and compressive strengths [26]. A cylinder with walls made of a 5-μm-thick Ti3C2Tx paper can support ~4000 times its own weight. It can be further strengthened by creating a Ti3C2Tx composite with 10 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to hold ~15,000 times its own weight (Fig. 20.2b) [25]. Theoretical calculations predict that M2X MXenes are stiffer and stronger than their M3X2 and M4X3 analogues [27, 28]. These properties can help ensure that the sulfur electrode forms a flexible structure without collapse during charge/discharge.\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 385"

The conductivity of Ti3C2Tx ranges from 1000 to 4600 S cm−1, for example, depending on the defect concentration [31]. These values exceed those of other solution-processed materials including graphene, making MXenes viable conductive hosts.

While the sulfur S8 ring is nonpolar, MXenes are polar due to the asymmetric chemical environments of the metal atoms. This apparent incompatibility is overcome by formation of metal-sulfur bonds during the molten sulfur infiltration process (155 ◦ C) [32]. In the sulfur-Ti2C MXene composite, there is evidence that the terminal Ti-OH groups on the surface are replaced with TiS groups, inducing a switch in the nature of the MXene phases from hydrophilic to Sulfophilic. Ti-S moieties on the surface were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 20.3a) [32]. In a separate study, density functional theory calculations showed that there is charge transfer of 0.26 e− between sulfur and the oxygen-terminated Ti2C substrate (Ti2CO2), which is indicative of a chemical interaction between sulfur and the MXene host [34]. Moreover, the band structure and density of states (DOS) diagram illustrate that LiPS adsorption does not change the bandgap of the MXene (Fig. 20.3b) [33, 35]."

      "text" : "Several studies have tried to understand the fundamental chemistry between the sulfur species and Ti-based MXenes by considering the pristine surface or with various different termination groups. Different modes of interaction have been proposed based on both computational and experimental studies.\n386 X. Liang and L. F. Nazar\nComputational studies based on first-principles calculations have provided valuable metrics regarding the theoretical strength of the interaction based on binding energies at an atomic scale. The binding energy is defined as the energy difference of the relaxed host/LiPSs system versus the sum of the isolated host and LiPS. A computational screening of O-terminated MXenes (Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2) revealed that the negatively charged oxygen terminal atoms interact with the positively charged Li+ ions in the LiPS species, giving rise to moderate binding energies in the range of 1–2 eV (Fig. 20.4a) [34]. Therefore, the chemical interaction of these soluble LiPS intermediates with the Ti2CO2 monolayer was mainly ascribed to the electrostatic attraction between the Li ions of the LiPS species and the Ti2CO2 monolayer. Chung et al. reported that Ti2CO2 suppresses the polysulfide shuttle in a different manner [35, 36]. By calculating the average charge of the sulfur atoms in LiPSs, they found that high-order LiPSs such as Li2S8 and Li2S6 tend to oxidize to elemental sulfur due to significantly weakened Li-S bonds by the strong Li-O interaction, while medium-order LiPSs such as Li2S4 maintain their original molecular configuration via sole Li-O interactions with the MXene substrate (Fig. 20.4b). For fluorine-terminated MXenes, the high-order LiPSs are adsorbed parallel to the substrate and the medium-order LiPSs are anchored vertical to the substrate\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 387\nvia Li-F interactions [33, 35]. However, the binding energy of the Li-F interaction is weak and was not observed in an experimental XPS study [37].\nCalculations suggest that hydroxyl-terminated MXenes tend to bind with LiPS via sulfur atom interactions (this premise assumes that the hydroxyl groups have not been consumed by reaction with elemental sulfur in forming the original composite) [32, 33, 37]. Given that the H atom in hydroxyl groups can shield the repulsive forces between the negatively charged S and O atoms, the hydroxyl-terminated MXenes demonstrate higher binding energies with LiPSs than that of O- and Fterminated MXenes, based on theory [33]. For example, the binding energy of Li2S4-Ti2C(OH)2 is about 3.4 eV [33, 37], while Li2S4-Ti2CO2 is 1.9 eV [34]. Calculations also show that the binding energy between LiPSs and the electrolyte solvent (i.e., a mixture of 1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane) is much weaker than that of the OH-terminated MXenes, suggesting that LiPSs preferentially adsorb on the MXene surface instead of being dissolved in the electrolyte [33, 35]. This understanding of the interaction between hydroxyl-terminated MXenes with LiPSs suggests that the H-S bond is the main interaction (Fig. 20.5a) [33]. That finding was supported by the dissociation energy difference of the –OH group (6.06 eV) and H atom (2.92 eV) from the MXene surface and hydroxyl group, respectively. The reasoning suggests the H atom of the hydroxyl group tends to partly dissociate, contributing to interaction with LiPSs via the H-S bond.\nA different view of the OH-terminated MXene interaction with LiPSs is supported by a combination of computational and experimental observations [37]. It was reported that LiPSs act as soft Lewis bases owing to the lone electron pairs of the sulfur atoms [38]. Therefore Lewis acid-type MXene host materials (free of terminal groups) are able to interact strongly with LiPSs via Ti-S coordination (Fig. 20.5b) [32]. More recent studies have elucidated the formation of Ti-S bonds, the decrease of terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface, as well as formation of a significant amount of thiosulfate-polythionate species on the MXene surface after contact with LiPS [37]. The formation of thiosulfate-polythionate species indicates a redox reaction between hydroxyl groups and LiPSs, similar to the cleavage of\n388 X. Liang and L. F. Nazar\nhydroxyl groups on graphene oxide by contact with LiPSs [16]. Once a terminal group vacancy is formed on the MXene surface (i.e., a hydroxyl vacancy), LiPSs could readily bond to the defect site via a Ti-S Lewis acid-base interaction with very high binding energy [37]. The interaction of hydroxyl-terminated MXene and LiPSs can therefore be described in a two-step process (Fig. 20.5c): The hydroxyl terminal groups on MXene first undergo redox with polysulfides to form surface thiosulfate groups, followed by the Wackenroder reaction [16] that exposes the Ti atoms. Second, the exposed and metastable Ti atoms readily accept additional polysulfides in the electrolyte and form Ti-S bonds by Lewis acid-base interactions.\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 389"

A fully delaminated MXene phase, Ti2C, combined metallic conductivity with a 2D surface abundant with Lewis acid Ti sites and hydroxyl groups. A strong Lewis acid-based interaction of the lithium polysulfides with the surface was demonstrated by metal-sulfur (TiS) binding at the interface [32, 37]. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl terminal groups undergo a redox reaction with LiPSs to form thiosulfate on the MXene surface, by which a thiosulfate-polythionate conversion is triggered as described above, that also contributes to suppressing the polysulfide shuttle [32, 37]. The adsorbed polysulfides are converted into Li2S to form nucleation sites on the surface, inducing further epitaxial deposition on the existing Li2S nuclei. Both mitigated diffusion of LiPSs and abundant Li2S nucleation sites act to control Li2S deposition on discharge, thereby improving electrochemical properties. The 70 wt% S/Ti2C composite exhibited excellent cycling performance with a specific capacity close to 1200 mAh g−1 at a C/5 current rate and capacity retention of 80% over 400 cycles at a C/2 current rate. Zhao et al. also reported the use of exfoliated MXene Ti3C2 (nondelaminated) composites as a sulfur host, which showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1290 mAh g−1 and excellent capacity retention of 970 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles [39].\nAlthough delaminated multilayer MXene sheets are expected to have a high surface area, the restacking of the nanosheets due to van der Waals forces upon removal of the delaminating solvent significantly limits the accessibility of LiPSs or Li+ ions, hindering the full utilization of their surface properties [40]. To prevent restacking of the delaminated MXene nanosheets, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced as spacers to create an interwoven MXene nanosheet/carbon-nanotube architecture (Fig. 20.6a, b) [37]. Ti2C, Ti3C2, and Ti3CN were examined in this study. The presence of CNTs between the nanosheets not only better exposes the MXene surfaces for polysulfide anchoring but further facilitates electron transport\n390 X. Liang and L. F. Nazar\nbetween the nanosheets, which is essential for Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading. Consequently, an initial discharge capacity of 1240 mAh g−1 was obtained, and a capacity of 450 mAh g−1 at a moderate sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm−2 was retained after 1200 cycles, corresponding to a decay rate of merely 0.043% per cycle. Moreover, a stable capacity of 910 mAh g−1 was delivered when the practical sulfur loading was increased up to 5.5 mg cm−2 (Fig. 20.6c). The good performance of the high loading electrodes emphasizes the importance of the high conductivity, high surface area, and the effective polysulfide chemical absorptivity of the MXene host material.\nThe same strategy of using spacers to create more active surface of MXenes was expanded to other functional materials such as mesoporous carbon [41] and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [42, 43], as shown in Fig. 20.7. Mesoporous carbon with a robust porous structure provides sufficient space for loading sulfur and effectively cushions the volumetric expansion of sulfur cathodes [41], while rGO also contributes to polysulfide adsorption via its active surface groups [42]. 3D conductive architectures were constructed with the Ti3C2 MXene phase uniformly distributed in these functional spacer matrices. High surface area was achieved for the composites, owing to the inhibited restacking of the MXene layers. Moreover, these 3D architectures also provide physical confinement for LiPSs due to their unique pore\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 391\nstructures. The Ti3C2@Meso-C/S cathodes with 73 wt% sulfur achieved a high initial capacity of 1225 mAh g−1 and reversible capacity of 705 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles at a C/2 current rate, respectively [41]. Similarly, Ti3C2/rGO/S with 70 wt% sulfur content exhibited a high initial capacity of 1145 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and a capacity retention of 880 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles [42].\nThese studies shed light on designing new functional MXene-based composites for Li-S batteries. The key factor is to preserve the uniform dispersion of MXene sheets in the spacer phases (i.e., to prevent them from being restacked) while maintaining the excellent conductivity, mechanical robustness, and rich surface properties of the MXene phases. There are many MXene composites being widely used beyond the Li-S battery arena, such as MXene-polymers [25, 44], MXeneoxides [45] and sulfides [46], and MXene-C3N4 composite [47], which could also show promise for high sulfur loading Li-S batteries by optimizing the electrode architecture.\nThe doping of MXene phases can provide more polysulfide adsorption sites. Wang et al. synthesized crumpled nitrogen-doped MXene nanosheets with large specific surface areas and a porous structure by thermal annealing of negatively charged metallic Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes and positively charged melamine (Fig. 20.8) [48]. The introduction of nitrogen into the MXene nanosheets effectively\n392 X. Liang and L. F.

Enhancement of the electrochemical properties and chemical adsorption capability was observed. Meanwhile, the large specific surface area and porous crumpled structure improved the physical absorptivity and the capability to accommodate high sulfur loading and volume expansion. Consequently, the nitrogen-doped MXene nanosheet-sulfur cathodes demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 1144 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C rate, a high level of capacity retention of 950 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles and extended cycling stability (610 mAh g−1 at 2 C after 1000 cycles; 590 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles with a 5.1 mg cm−2 sulfur loading).\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 393"

      "text" : "Inserting a conductive interlayer between the cathode and the separator is another effective strategy to enhance sulfur utilization, which was first demonstrated by the Manthiram group [49]. It is believed that the freestanding carbon interlayer functions to confine lithium polysulfides to the sulfur cathode side and also works as a secondary current collector to improve active material utilization. To avoid sacrificing the energy density of the battery, it may even be more desirable to modify the separator with a thin layer of conductive material such as a MXene. The ultrathin two-dimensional structure also facilitates the formation of freestanding membranes by simple filtration. Benefiting from these advantages, MXenes were deposited on the side of the separator facing the sulfur electrode to form a conformal coating layer on a separator without obvious pores or gaps (Fig. 20.9) [50, 51]. The thin MXene layer immobilizes soluble polysulfide from the cathode region of the cell via both physisorption and chemisorption and also improves the reaction kinetics by decreasing the charge transfer resistance. Lin et al. reported a Ti3C2 nanosheetcovered glass fiber composite separator prepared by a simple vacuum filtration process [50]. Using this approach, a Li-S cathode containing commercial bulk sulfur delivered an initial discharge capacity of 820 mAh g−1. Good rate capability was achieved over 100 cycles: 720 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and 590 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1.5 A g−1, respectively. Song et al. proposed a Ti3C2Tx nanosheet-coated commercial “Celgard” membrane to improve the performance of Li-S batteries [51]. The thickness of the Ti3C2Tx coating layer was only 520 nm with a loading mass of 0.1 mg cm−3. A simple sulfur/carbon black composite cathode exhibited a high initial capacity of 1050, 850, and 745 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, and 1C rates, respectively. The cells also showed very good long-term cycling performance with a high Columbic efficiency of almost 100% and a very small capacity decay of 0.062% per cycle at 0.5 C.\n394 X. Liang and L. F.

      "text" : "While MXenes are promising hosts for the positive electrode of the Li-S battery, they have also been employed to inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites at the negative Li electrode in the cell due to their lithiophilic properties [52]. Dendrite formation is especially a challenge for high-sulfur-loaded batteries at high current densities [6]. Li dendrites not only result in cell short circuits that give rise to safety issues but also accelerate detrimental reactions with the electrolyte and the dissolved LiPS species [53]. The lithium anode becomes covered by thick insulating passivation layers and is finally pulverized, causing cell failure. MXenes demonstrate strong affinity toward Li by forming Li-C bonds, providing numerous nucleation sites for lithium deposition. The lamellar structured MXenes enable controllable lithium deposition into their nanoscaled gaps and the high surface area reduces the local current density, thus mitigating dendrite growth [52]. This concept was demonstrated by a flexible Ti3C2 MXene-lithium film anode prepared by a roll-to-roll mechanical approach. Lithium was mainly deposited in the gaps of the Ti3C2 nanosheets as illustrated by in situ TEM, and thus potential vertical growth of lithium dendrites was restricted (Fig. 20.10) [52]. Owing to the good electrical conductivity of the MXene, a very low overpotential (32 mV at 1.0 mA cm−2) and flat voltage profiles were observed during Li plating/stripping. The effectiveness of the Ti3C2-lithium anode was demonstrated by coupling it with a sulfur/carbon cathode in a full Li-S battery. The cell exhibited a high reversible capacity of 950 mAh g−1 and 840 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, which was improved compared to the cell with a bare Li anode. However, the drawback of this concept is restricted by the limited in-plane gap of the MXene. After the gaps are fully filled, additional lithium will gradually deposit and form dendrites, as indicated by the authors.\n20 MXene Materials as Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 395"

      "text" : "Significant advancement in developing high-performance Li-S batteries within the last few years – from rational designing of the host material to understanding the electrochemistry – has shortened the gap between fundamental research to practical applications. The excellent electrical conductivity, robust mechanical strength, and versatile surface chemistry of MXenes convey tunable properties as sulfur host materials. MXene phases show distinct improvement in suppressing the polysulfide shuttle via surface interactions, which is vital to the long-term cycling performance of Li-S batteries. High areal sulfur loading Li-S batteries for practical applications calls for electrodes with facile electron/Li+ ion pathways. Here, MXenes and their composites enable construction of a flexible structure that can maintain the integrity of the electrode while ensuring electron/ Li+ ion accessibility to the active sulfur/sulfide mass. The rich MXene surface chemistry also exhibits strong affinity toward lithium atoms, providing a stable high surface area substrate for Li deposition at the negative electrode that mitigates dendrite formation. Thus, the development of MXenes shows potential to solve some fundamental problems faced by Li-S batteries, and may open new avenues to achieve long cycle life, and high energy density with consideration of the following perspectives.\nIt is important to synthesize MXenes with uniformly distributed surface termination with the same type of moieties (i.e., hydroxyl). Though computation can simulate the interaction with LiPSs species by different individual surface groups, it is vital to understand and distinguish the interaction mechanism by experimental studies.\nWe note that only Ti-based MXenes have been used for Li-S batteries, but over 100 distinct MXene compositions have been synthesized and predicted to date. Computational studies could guide the selection of materials based on their interaction strength with LiPSs. Composites with other functional phases are also attractive to improve the surface reactivity, the mechanical robustness, and the electrical conductivity of MXenes, which are promising directions for high-sulfur loading electrodes by optimizing these parameters. It is especially important to note that for practical applications, the development of Li-S cells that utilize a low electrolyte volume is vital to push the field forward. Most studies conducted to date have not taken this factor into consideration; MXene phases may offer advantages in this respect over porous carbons.\nThe ability of MXene anode films to suppress lithium dendrite formation is a new avenue of exploration. A stable lithium metal anode will not only benefit LiS batteries but also could boost the energy density of current Li-ion batteries by replacing the graphite anode. However, more fundamental studies are necessary to uncover the underlying mechanism for dendrite suppression. Material engineering of MXenes and its composites to construct architectures with high surface area and porosity is also highly desirable in this respect.\n396 X. Liang and L. F. Nazar"

      "text" : "Recent advances in the telecommunication industry coupled with the introduction of various electronic gadgets have revolutionized the modern era. However, the wide use of these new devices has also become a source of dreadful electromagnetic interference (EMI) pollution [1–5]. This interference in electromagnetic (EM) radiations disrupts the functioning and performance of many electronic devices, decreasing their efficiency and degrading their service life. Most importantly, the exposure of these EM radiations to humans may cause potential health hazards including cancer (long-term exposure) and nervous system disorders [6–9].\nEMI shielding aims to minimize the transmission of EM radiation using a shield to maximize the reflection and/or absorption of EM waves incident at the interfaces between two media. EM waves transmit, reflect, or absorb in a medium. The electric and magnetic field components of EM waves are perpendicular to each other as well as to the propagation direction (Fig. 21.1). Electric and magnetic fields associated with EM waves are described in a phasor form by Eqs. 21.1 and 21.2: [10–11]\n−→ E = Ee−γ zâx = Ee−αz e−jβzâx = Ee−αz (cos βz − j sin βz) âx (21.1)\nC. M.

Koo et al.\n−→ H = He−γ zây = He−αze−jβzây = He−αz (cos βz − j sin βz) ây (21.2)\nwhere γ is the propagation constant of the medium; α and β are the attenuation and phase shift constants, respectively; and E and H are amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. An EM wave usually propagates without reflection in a single medium. However, when an EM wave is incident at the interface of two different media, reflection may occur. Eqs. 21.3 and 21.4 represent the reflection coefficient (RC; R12) and transmission coefficient (T12) at the interface, which are determined by the impedance of the media as follows: [10–11]\nR12 = Er Ei = η2 − η1 η2 + η1 (21.3)\nT12 = Et Ei = 2η2 η2 + η1 (21.4)\nwhere Ei and Er are the amplitudes of the incident and reflected electric fields, respectively, and η1 and η2 are the impedance of medium 1 and medium 2, respectively. Wave impedance is defined as the ratio of the electric and magnetic fields. Intrinsic impedance of a medium can be expressed as a function of angular frequency (ω), magnetic permeability (μ), electrical conductivity (σ ), and permittivity (ε):\nη = |E||H | = √ jωμ σ + jωε (21.5)\nWhen an EM wave propagates in a lossy medium (or a shield) that has a nonzero α, the lossy medium generally absorbs the wave. Therefore, the strength (amplitude) of the field diminishes exponentially as the penetration depth increases\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 401\n(E = E0e−αz). The attenuation constant (α) of the material can be expressed as a function of ω, μ, σ , and ε of the shield: [10–11]\nα = ω √√√√με\n2\n[√ 1 +\n( σ ωε\n)2 − 1 ]\n(21.6)\nThus, an EM wave passing through a shield (Fig. 21.2) undergoes reflection at two interfaces and absorption by the shield. The ratio of the total transmission field relative to the incident field can be expressed as follows: [10–11]\nEt Ei = T12e−αdT23 = 2η η + η0 e −αd 2η0 η + η0 = 4ηη0 (η + η0)2 e−αd (21.7)\nwhere T12 and T23 are the transmission coefficients at the front and back surfaces of the shield, respectively, and α and d are the attenuation constant and the thickness of the shield, respectively.\nThe shielding effectiveness (SE) of a thick shield is defined in dB as follows: [10–11]\n402 C. M. Koo et al.\nSET = 20 log ( Ei\nEt\n) (21.8)\nSET = SER + SEA = 20 log (η + η0) 2\n4ηη0 + 20 log eαd (21.9)\nwhere SET is the total SE and SER and SEA represent the shielding due to reflection and absorption, respectively. SER is induced by reflection on the surface of the shield and SEA represents the absorption of the EM wave by the shield. It should be noted that although the wave reflected from the second interface can contribute to the wave transmission after being re-reflected by the first interface, this value is usually negligible for a thick shield with an SET larger than 15 dB [10–11]. For electrically conductive shield materials that have σ ωε, the attenuation constant (α) and impedance (η) can be represented as follows:α = √πf μσ and η = √ jωμ σ\n= √\nj2πf μ σ , whereas for electrically insulating media such as air, σ o = 0, αo=0, and ηo = √ μ0 ε0\n= 377 . Here f is the frequency. Thus, SERand SEA can be rearranged as follows: [10–12]\nSER = 39.5 + 10 log σ 2πf μ\n(21.10)\nSEA = 8.7αd = 8.7d δ = 8.7d√πf μσ (21.11) where δ is the skin (or penetration) depth, which is a useful term for shielding and indicates the distance beneath the surface at which the intensity of the electric field decreases to 1/e of the original incident wave intensity. For a conductive shield, the skin depth is expressed as δ = 1 α = (√πf σμ)−1. Equations 21.10 and 21.11 clearly indicate that electrical conductivity is the major factor contributing to reflection and absorption. Permittivity and permeability also play a significant role in further increasing the absorption contribution, thus increasing the overall EMI SE."

      "text" : "EMI shielding materials must possess high electrical conductivity. MXenes, discovered in 2011 [13], are a unique family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides with the formula Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal (e.g., Ti, Zr, V, Nb, Ta, or Mo) and X is carbon and/or nitrogen [14]. MXenes possess an excellent electrical conductivity (~5000 S/cm), which\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 403\nmakes them strong candidates for EMI shielding materials. Shahzad et al. [6] reported three types of MXene films (Ti3C2Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2Ti2C3Tx) and nacre-like MXene–polymer composite films (Ti3C2Tx–sodium alginate (SA)) with excellent EMI shielding performance. Figure 21.3 shows pristine MXene and composite films fabricated by using vacuum filtration of fully exfoliated MXene platelets with a thickness of 1 nm and sub-micron lengths. The microscopic images (Fig. 21.3a–d) depict the layer-by-layer assembly of the MXene flakes and the wellaligned MXene distribution in the MXene–polymer composite. Due to the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx (~5000 S/cm), 2.5- and 45-μm-thick Ti3C2Tx laminates exhibited extraordinary EMI SE values of 50 and 92 dB, respectively (Fig. 21.3e).\nEMI SE values usually increased with increasing thickness of the shielding material, indicating that high EMI SE values were expected for thick samples. Surprisingly, at the same thickness level, the EMI SE of MXene was comparable to\n404 C. M. Koo et al.\nthat of pure metal films with two orders of magnitude larger electrical conductivities. Moreover, the EMI SE was retained even when MXene flakes were added to the insulating SA polymer. In particular, an 8-μm-thick Ti3C2Tx–SA (90 wt. %) polymer composite film showed an extraordinary EMI SE value of 57 dB.\nShahzad et al. explained that the excellent EMI shielding capability of the MXene films originated from their exceptional electrical conductivity and partially from the customized architecture of the laminate films. When EM waves struck the surface of a MXene film of high electrical conductivity, most of them were immediately reflected because of the high impedance mismatch at the interface between air and the highly conductive MXene film with abundant free electrons, whereas the remaining EM waves passed through the MXene lattice structure, where interaction with MXene having a high electron density induced eddy currents that contributed to ohmic losses, resulting in a strong attenuation in the energy of the EM waves. The surviving EM waves, after passing through the first layer, encountered the next barrier layer, and the same process of EM wave reflection and attenuation was repeated. The MXene laminate, which is composed of several thousand MXene sheets, acts as multiple shields that enhances scattering and internal reflections. The process helped the MXene laminate to effectively absorb EM energy and dissipate in the form of heat. Therefore, MXene and MXene–composite films exhibited very high absorption loss behavior during the shielding. They further reported that these MXene films had additional advantages such as high electrical conductivity, easy processing, low density, and mechanical flexibility.\nElectrically conductive polymer composites with good mechanical properties and long-term durability are highly desirable for EMI shielding. Generally, to achieve high electrical conductivity in polymer composites, large filler volumes are needed, which not only make the end product costly but also cause processing difficulties. Despite the excellent conventional intrinsic electrical conductivity of MXenes, a high MXene filler content is needed to develop conductive composites [16]. Sun et al. [15] demonstrated an electrostatic assembly approach for fabricating highly conductive MXene@polystyrene (PS) nanocomposites with a very low MXene content. Their concept was to utilize a segregated-structured composite to reduce the filler content while maintaining the electrical contact among MXene layers. As shown in Fig. 21.4a, positively charged PS beads with a diameter of 80, 310, and 570 μm were uniformly covered with negatively charged MXene sheets (zeta potential ~ −40 mV) through electrostatic interaction in an aqueous solution. The dried Ti3C2Tx-coated PS beads (Ti3C2Tx@PS) were molded by high-temperature compression molding. The Ti3C2Tx MXenes formed a segregated network in the composite (Fig. 21.4b–c). The electrical conductivity (σ ) rapidly increased with the increasing Ti3C2Tx volume fraction (ρ), which was according to the power law. Due to formation of the segregated structure, the composite reached the percolation threshold concentration at a very low filler content of 0.26 vol. %. The Ti3C2Tx@PS composite with a MXene filler content of 1.20 vol. % showed an electrical conductivity of 602 S/m, which further increased to 1081 S/m at a filler content of 1.90 vol. % (Fig. 21.4d). The effect of the high conductivity of the MXene–polymer composite was evident from the exceptional EMI shielding\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 405\nperformance shown in Fig. 21.4e. Pristine PS showed negligible EMI SE owing to its insulating feature; however, when the filler (Ti3C2Tx) was introduced, the SE increased gradually and reached a remarkable value above 60 dB for the 1.90 vol. % Ti3C2Tx/polymer composite film with a thickness of 2 mm.\nSometimes, lightweight shielding materials are highly desirable for EMI applications, such as portable devices and aerospace fields. To achieve this, materials must possess low density. Liu et al. [17] reported an efficient and facile approach to fabricate freestanding, flexible, and lightweight Ti3C2Tx MXene foams with reasonable mechanical strength and low density. A MXene laminate film was fabricated via filtration and subsequently treated with hydrazine at 90 ◦C to induce the foaming process (Fig. 21.5a–d). The hydrazine treatment led to the formation of a continuous cellular structure and an associated volume expansion of the MXene film. After the foaming process, 1-, 3-, and 6-μm-thick MXene films were expanded to 6.2-, 18-, and 60-μm-thick MXene foams. The MXene films had an electrical conductivity of 4000 S/cm. The conductivities of the foams decreased to 588, 625, and 580 S/cm, respectively. Interestingly, the EMI SE values of the MXene foams were higher than those of their bulk counterparts even though the foams possessed lower electrical conductivities. The EMI SE of the 6-μm-thick (53 dB) MXene film improved to 70 dB for its foam counterpart (60 μm) (Fig. 21.5g–h). The considerably enhanced EMI SE values were ascribed to the multi-reflection and scattering of the incident waves within the porous structure of the MXene foam. Interestingly, the MXene foams had larger Ti/O and C/O ratios than pristine MXene films, indicating the partial removal of the oxygen functionalities during the foaming process. As a result, the MXene foams exhibited strong surface hydrophobicity and outstanding water resistance and durability, which was in contrast to the well-known hydrophilic nature of pristine MXene sheets (Fig. 21.5e–f). This foaming approach could overcome the instability of MXene films in moist environments by providing\n406 C. M. Koo et al.\na hydrophobic surface as well as maintaining the properties of MXene, such as electrical conductivity and high EMI SE.\nIn addition to possessing the lightweight feature with excellent EMI SE, high mechanical strength is another essential property required for good shielding materials. Cao et al. [18] synthesized MXene/cellulose nanofiber composite paper with nacre-inspired structure possessing good mechanical properties and high EMI SE. Ultrathin and highly flexible Ti3C2Tx/cellulose nanofiber (CNF) composite papers bearing a nacre-like lamellar structure with varying content of MXene were fabricated via a vacuum filtration-induced self-assembly process (Fig. 21.6a). As a result of the interaction between one-dimensional (1D) CNFs and two-dimensional (2D) d-Ti3C2Tx (de-laminated) MXene, binary strengthening and toughening of the nacre-like d-Ti3C2Tx/CNF composite paper was achieved, leading to high tensile strength (up to 135.4 MPa) and fracture strain (up to 16.7%), as well as excellent folding endurance (up to 14,260 times). The as-prepared composite papers maintain the electrical conductivity expected from MXene-based polymer composites. Figure 21.6b shows the variation of electrical conductivity as a result of increase in the d-Ti3C2Tx filler content in CNFs. The d-Ti3C2Tx/CNF composite paper with 40 wt. % d-Ti3C2Tx content has an electrical conductivity of 0.6188 S/m, which was significantly improved to a value of 739.4 S/m when d-Ti3C2Tx content was increased to 90 wt.%. The composite papers with different filler contents (50, 80, and 90 wt.%) were subjected to EMI shielding measurements as shown in Fig. 21.6c, exhibiting excellent EMI SE of >20 dB at small thicknesses. High EMI SE was ascribed to large electrical conductivity as well as unique nacre-like structure that promotes the internal reflection and scattering of EM waves.\nConventional polymer composites comprising MXenes as nanofillers have also been shown to perform well for EMI shielding. For example, Liu et al. [19] used paraffin wax as a binder/matrix to fabricate MXene/paraffin composites using MXene sheets containing variable loads and tested their EMI shielding property in the 2–18 GHz frequency range. Results showed that the EMI SE values increased\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 407\nwith increasing Ti3C2Tx filler content, and that the maximum SE value of 39.1 dB was reached for the Ti3C2Tx/paraffin composite with 60 wt. % Ti3C2Tx and a thickness of 2.0 mm."

      "heading" : "MXenes as Microwave-Absorbing Materials",
      "text" : "Another important aspect of undesirable EM radiation is microwave absorption (MWA). Microwave-absorbing materials have attracted extensive attention, as they can be used not only for general EMI shielding applications but also for crucial military stealth technology to make objects less detectable by radar. The minimum transmission of EM radiation for EMI shielding is simply achieved by high electrical conductivity, permittivity, and permeability. However, the control and design of microwave-absorbing materials is more challenging. MWA aims to minimize the reflection of EM radiation. For this purpose, EM-absorbing materials need an intermediate permittivity, moderate permeability, and low electrical conductivity to guarantee impedance matching at the interfaces between media and high energy loss in a lossy microwave-absorbing material.\n408 C. M. Koo et al.\nMWA is evaluated by reflection loss (RL), sometimes called as the reflection coefficient (RC). Unlike EMI SE, RL assumes no-transmission condition and is experimentally measured only when the microwave-absorbing materials are backed by highly conductive metal backgrounds that do not allow transmission. Thus, in the scheme of Fig. 21.2, medium 3 is replaced by a metal background. That is, the incident waves are either reflected or absorbed, without transmission.\nRL is defined by the following eq.: [10]\nRL = 20 log ∣∣∣∣ηin − η0ηin + η0 ∣∣∣∣ (21.12) where η0 is impedance of air and ηin is the characteristic input impedance of the material. ηin is expressed as follows: [10–11]\nηin = √ μ\nε tanh\n[ j ( 2πf d\nc\n) √ με ] (21.13)\nwhere μ and ε are the complex permeability and permittivity of the absorber, respectively, and c is the velocity of light.\nηin is a function of ω, μ, σ , and ε. The first and the most important requirement for a microwave-absorbing material is impedance matching at the interface between the media, indicating that ηin should be matched with η0. A perfect matching condition minimizes the reflection of the incident wave at the surface of the microwave-absorbing material, which allows maximum penetration of the EM wave into the material. The second requirement is maximum energy loss through absorption in an absorber. To obtain maximum absorption loss, the materials should have a high attenuation constant. Since the electrical conductivity of microwaveabsorbing materials should be negligibly low for the impedance matching condition to be satisfied, the attenuation constant α is reconstructed by the following eq.: [3, 20]\nα = √ 2πf\nc ×\n√ (μ′′ε′′ − μ′ε′) + √ (μ′ε′′ + μ′′ε′)2 + (μ′′ε′′ − μ′ε′)2 (21.14)\nEquation 21.14 indicates that the attenuation in the absorber is governed by the loss mechanism associated with complex dielectric permittivity (ε = ε′ − jε′′) and magnetic permeability (μ = μ′ − jμ′′). The real parts of complex permittivity (ε ′ ) and permeability (μ ′ ) represent the stored potential electric and magnetic energy inside the material, respectively, whereas the imaginary parts (ε′′) and (μ′′) represent the loss as a result of heat dissipation due to various polarization mechanisms. Both dielectric loss tangent (tanδ = ε′′ε′ ) and magnetic loss tangent (tanδμ= μ ′′ μ′ ) are also used as key indicators of the loss mechanism. To understand peak patterns of RL curves, a quarter-wavelength matching model should be considered. The relationship between the absorber thickness (tm) and the\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 409\npeak frequency (fm) can be described by the following eq.: [21]\ntm = nλ 4 = nc( 4fm √ (|εr | |μr |) ) ; n = 1, 3, 5, . . . (21.15)\nwhere n and λ are the integer number and the wavelength of the EM waves, respectively, and |εr| and |μr| are the relative permittivity and permeability moduli at fm. When tm and fm satisfy the matching condition, the EM waves at the air–absorber interface and absorber–conductive metal background interface are out of phase by 180◦, resulting in their extinction at the air–absorber interface; consequently, the absorber possesses maximum absorption behavior at fm.\nSo far, various EM absorbents have been reported, including micro-/nano-sized magnetic or dielectric absorbing materials such as ferrite, magnetic metal powders, carbon-based materials, and intrinsically conducting polymers. Recently, Ti3C2Tx MXene materials have attracted extensive attention as microwave-absorbing materials due to their good electrical conductivity, unique surface characteristics, and ability to form heterostructures [22–23].\nQing et al. [24] reported the MWA properties of Ti3AlC2 (MAX)- and Ti3C2Tx (MXene)-filled epoxy composites. Ti3AlC2 was the source material for the fabrication of Ti3C2Tx. Both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity (ε ′ ′ and ε ′ ) of the Ti3C2Tx composites were much higher than those of the Ti3AlC2 powder composites with the same filler content (50 wt. %). Since Ti3C2Tx had a good electrical conductivity and better dispersion in the matrix than Ti3AlC2, the Ti3C2Tx composite had a much larger RL value (−17 dB) than the Ti3AlC2 composite (~ −3 dB) at a thickness of 1.4 mm and a much better microwave absorption bandwidth (RL < −10 dB with a frequency bandwidth of 6 GHz) as compared to no absorption of Ti3AlC2 composite in the given frequency range. The enhanced MWA properties of the MXene composites were ascribed to the improved dielectric polarization loss originating from their unique layered structure with a high aspect ratio, large number of defects, and large internal boundary layer capacitance.\nGenerally, the presence or creation of polarizable charges on the surface of nanomaterials enhances MWA. For example, Han et al. [16] reported that the partial oxidation of Ti3C2Tx had a positive effect on its EM absorption performance. When Ti3C2Tx was annealed at 800 ◦C in argon atmosphere, TiO2 nanoparticles in the form of anatase and rutile phases and amorphous carbon were partially formed on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. The partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx–wax composites showed much larger ε ′ ′ and ε ′ values than un-annealed Ti3C2Tx composites and corresponding MAX phase polymer composites, indicating a much larger dielectric loss. The dielectric composite with 50 wt. % annealed Ti3C2Tx exhibited an excellent RC of −48.4 dB at 11.6 GHz with a reasonable microwave absorption bandwidth of 2.5 GHz corresponding to RC value < −10 dB.\nHan et al. [25] also reported the EM absorption performance of fully oxidized Ti3C2Tx. When Ti3C2Tx was annealed and fully oxidized at 800 ◦C in CO2, Ti3C2Tx was completely transformed into TiO2 nanoparticles (where TiO2 existed only in the rutile phase) and amorphous carbon (Fig. 21.7a). The as-synthesized\n410 C. M. Koo et al.\nlaminated carbon/TiO2 were embedded in a wax matrix to fabricate polymer composites with different filler contents. The real and imaginary parts of permittivity of the composites increased with increasing filler content (Fig. 21.7b–c). The peak frequency (fm) of the RC curves decreased with increasing sample thickness due to the quarter-wavelength matching effect described in Eq. 21.15. The RC value reached −36 dB at 15.5 and 10.5 GHz for sample thicknesses of 1.6 and 2.2 mm, respectively (Fig. 21.7d). The effective microwave absorption bandwidth corresponding to RC value < −10 dB covers the whole Ku-band (12.4–18 GHz) with a thickness of only 1.7 mm, whereas for X-band, the effective microwave absorption is obtained from 8.7 to 12.3 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.2 mm.\nHan et al. proposed the associated absorption mechanism based on the electrical conductivity, surface characteristics, and heterostructure of Ti3C2Tx MXenes in the composites. The dipole polarization caused by the surface functional groups, localized defects, and dangling bonds of Ti3C2Tx MXenes improved the dielectric loss. Additionally, because of the multilayered structure and high conductivity of MXenes, they could facilitate excited hopping charge carriers by constructing more conductive paths. Meanwhile, 2D-stacked Ti3C2Tx sheets could contribute to more interfaces, thus increasing the EM wave propagation path and electric current path\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 411\ndiscontinuities, which in turn led to further attenuation of the EM wave. Moreover, after annealing, the decrease in number of the hydroxyl terminal groups and the formation of amorphous carbon gave rise to orientation polarizations in the alternating EM field owing to its disordered character and a high concentration of structural defects and oxygen functional groups, as shown in Fig. 21.7e. Furthermore, the formation of the TiO2 phase optimized the impedance matching with free space because of the low permittivity of TiO2. Importantly, the incorporation of TiO2 nanocrystals and carbon could generate dielectric dipole interactions at multiple interfaces and the associated relaxation and could form a capacitor-like structure to induce strong energy loss in the EM wave.\nLi et al. [26] reported a similar finding using Ti2CTx-based MXenes. Controllable heterogeneous structures were constructed via etching in an oxidation environment. The improved EM wave absorption capability of the as-prepared Ti2CTx/TiO2 and C/TiO2 nanocomposites compared to that of pristine Ti2CTx MXenes was attributed to their enhanced polarization loss and higher conductivity loss. The C/TiO2 nanocomposites attained a minimum RC of −50.3 dB at 7.1 and 14.2 GHz and an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.7 GHz corresponding to RC value < −10 dB (covering the entire X-band) for a thickness of 2.1 mm, which confirmed the excellent EM wave absorption properties of these heterogeneous structures.\nIn another report, Li et al. [27] showed that combining 2D Ti3C2Tx and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could significantly enhance the EM wave absorption properties of the composites. CNTs were uniformly distributed in the interlayers of Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes, as shown in Fig. 21.8a–b. Compared with pristine Ti3C2Tx MXenes and a-Ti3C2Tx MXenes (annealed), the Ti3C2Tx/CNT nanocomposites with a hierarchical sandwich microstructure provided excellent EM wave absorption performance in the frequency range of 2–18 GHz (Fig. 21.8c), including a higher absorption intensity (minimum RC was −30 dB), broader effective absorption bandwidth (4.46 GHz for corresponding RC value of < −10 dB), lower filler content (35 wt. %), and smaller thickness (only 1.55 mm).\nQing et al. [28] reported that the synergistic effect of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-GP) and Ti3C2Tx in epoxy composites could provide an exciting opportunity to tune the MWA properties of MXene-based composites. The N-GP/Ti3C2Tx/epoxy\n412 C. M. Koo et al.\ncomposite showed a highly improved dielectric constant (ε ′ ) and dielectric loss (ε ′ ′ ), which resulted in an excellent RL value of −52 dB for a thickness of 1.4 mm and a large absorption bandwidth of 7.1 GHz below RL value of −10 dB. The excellent performance of the as-synthesized composite was ascribed to the unique microstructure and numerous defects of the N-GP and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, a larger internal boundary layer capacitance, the formation of a microcapacitor network, and the evolution of conductive/dielectric loss.\nSimilarly, Tong et al. [29] reported the synergistic effects of a conductive polymer (polypyrrole, PPy) matrix and Ti3C2Tx to improve the absorption of EM waves in MXene-based polymer composites with a wider effective bandwidth. Ti3C2Tx/PPy hybrids were synthesized via in situ polymerization of PPy in Ti3C2Tx dispersions. Compared with pristine MXenes, the EM parameters (real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss tangents) increased when a conducting PPy polymer matrix was used, achieving a minimum RL of −49.2 dB at 8.5 GHz and an effective absorption bandwidth of 4.9 GHz corresponding to RL value < −10 dB (Fig. 21.9a–d). The enhanced absorption was closely correlated with the well-designed heterogeneous multilayered structure, extra heterogeneous interfaces, conductive paths, surface functional groups, localized defects, and synergistic effect\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 413\nof Ti3C2Tx and the conducting filler network, which significantly improved the impedance matching and dielectric energy loss.\nQian et al. [30] reported a mild method to prepare an urchin-like ZnO–MXene Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite through a co-precipitation process. The nanocomposite delivered a substantially enhanced EM absorption performance with an optimal RL of −26.30 dB that cover a wide frequency range (from 16.6 to 18.0 GHz) under RL value < −10 dB, significantly higher than that of pristine Ti3C2Tx (−6.70 dB). The large increase in RL was ascribed to the features and structure of the ZnO–Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite. The surface groups and localized defects on the Ti3C2Tx layers led to dipole polarization, which significantly affected the dielectric loss. In the ZnO– Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite, the balance between the complex parts of permeability and permittivity led the material to satisfy the impedance matching conditions, resulting in better absorption of the incident EM waves compared to that in pristine MXenes.\nCoupling of magnetic materials with MXenes was attempted to improve the impedance matching, broaden the effective absorption bandwidth, and enhance the absorption intensity. Yang et al. [31] reported that coupling of Ti3C2Tx MXenes with a magnetic loss material, Ba3Co2Fe24O41 (Co2Z), could improve MWA properties of the formed composites, where Co2Z represents Z-type hexagonal barium ferrite\n414 C. M. Koo et al.\n(Fig. 21.10a). Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) was used as the matrix polymer. In the magnetic hysteresis loops (M–H), the PVB/Co2Z/Ti3C2 composite revealed an S-shaped curve and a saturation magnetization (Ms) of 16 emu/g. The magnetic properties were induced by the presence of magnetic Co2Z in the composite. The PVB/Co2Z/Ti3C2 composite had a minimum RL of −46.3 dB at 5.8 GHz and a very wide effective absorption bandwidth of 1.6 GHz for a thickness of 2.8 mm corresponding to RL below −10 dB (Fig. 21.10b). The excellent RL performance was attributed to various dielectric and magnetic loss phenomena. The magnetic energy dissipation of materials could be caused by hysteresis loss, eddy current loss and domain wall displacement, and natural resonance loss. Since magnetic hysteresis derived from irreversible magnetization was negligible under a weak applied magnetic field and domain wall motion loss was also negligible in the GHz region, eddy current loss and natural resonance loss were the main contributors to magnetic loss. In Fig. 21.10c, frequency independence of the μ′′(μ′)−2f−1 values in two frequency ranges, 2–9 and 13–18 GHz, verified the eddy current loss effect is dominant, while the strong peak value in 9–13 GHz supported the resonance loss effect (Fig. 21.10d). Additionally, high permeability features originating from magnetic Co2Z benefited the impedance matching.\nLi et al. [32] also reported the absorption properties of Ni–Zn ferrite/Ti3C2 composites, where the main reason of using ferrite was to enhance the synergistic contribution of the two intrinsically different materials. The Ni–Zn ferrite/Ti3C2 composite with 5 wt. % Ti3C2 content exhibited a high RL of −42.5 dB at 13.5 GHz and a very broad effective absorption bandwidth of ~3 GHz (12–15 GHz) corresponding to RL below −10 dB. Like the PVB/Co2Z/Ti3C2 composite [31], the excellent microwave-absorbing performance was attributed to the magnetic loss, dielectric loss, conductivity loss, and internal reflection and scattering phenomena."

      "text" : "EMI shielding using MXenes has attracted immense interest since the breakthrough discovery of MXenes in 2016. Several reports on the use of MXenes as primary or secondary constituents to investigate EMI shielding and microwave-absorbing properties have been published. However, the use of MXenes is still in its infancy, and there is considerable scope for further exploring these materials to improve its properties. One of the approaches could be to develop porous MXenes with high mechanical strength, where the void spaces inside MXenes could act as reflecting surfaces, thereby increasing the overall EMI SE. Developing lightweight and flexible conducting polymer composites based on MXenes composites also offers a new avenue of research. Single-layer MXenes possess excellent transparency comparable to graphene and can serve as a platform to develop transparent MXene films for next-generation telecommunication gadgets. Since MXenes have a large family and only a few MXenes have been explored for EMI shielding thus far, there is further scope to explore other MXenes for EMI shielding or MWA applications.\n21 Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Using MXenes and Their Composites 415\nMagnetic MXenes form an area of future research as they can not only improve the EMI shielding property but also significantly influence the MWA properties. The addition of other magnetic constituents in MXene-based polymer composite systems offers a great potential for the research and improvement of properties through the synergistic contribution of MXene and other filler materials."

      "text" : "MXenes are a large family of transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides with a general formula of Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M is an early transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx denotes surface termination (-OH, -O, or F) [1]. MXenes are prepared from layered ternary metal carbides (MAX phases) by selectively etching of the group A element layer [2]. Numerous MXenes including Ti3C2, Ti2C, Nb4C3 [3], Ti3CN, Ta4C3 [4], Nb2C, V2C [5], and Nb4C3 were synthesized from MAX phases [3]. In addition, several MXene compositions have been developed with random arrangement of two or more transition metals such as (Ti0.5,Nb0.5)2C, (V0.5,Cr0.5)3C2 [6–10], and more complex structures have been theoretically predicted. Synthesizing MXenes from their respective MAX precursor has been done by two major routes: (1) direct use of hydrogen fluoride (HF) as the etchant solution or (2) with in situ HF formed by reacting hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a fluoride salt such as lithium fluoride (LiF), ammonium hydrogen bifluoride (NH4HF2), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) [11, 12]. In most cases, only Al had been successfully etched from MAX phases to prepare MXene. However, synthesis of MXene through selective etching of silicon from titanium silicon carbide has been recently reported [13]. The first and most established MXene is titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), which is synthesized by etching Al from Ti3AlC2 [11]. Ti3AlC2 has a layered hexagonal structure with P63/mmc symmetry, forming strong Ti-C bonds, which are a combination of covalent, metallic, and ionic in nature, as well as purely metallic Ti-Al bonds [14, 15]. Different stacking patterns are predicted by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) for MXene depending on the type of precursor and\nK. Rasool · R. P. Pandey · P. A. Rasheed · G. R. Berdiyorov · K. A.

For example, Ti3C2Tx prepared by (LiF/HCl) shows a (002) peak at around 7.82◦ corresponding to the c lattice parameter = 22.6 Å, which is higher than the c (19.6 Å) of Ti3C2Tx (HF) around 9.02◦. This is most likely due to the difference in the number of water layers between the stacks [12]. The diverse chemistries of the MX bonds in MXenes combined with their high surface functionality lead to a range of properties including high electronic and in some cases metallic conductivity, hydrophilicity, tunable band gaps, and plasmonic properties. For this reason, MXene research has been geared toward versatile applications in the fields of energy storage as supercapacitors and lithium ion battery electrodes [1, 6, 16–18], electronics as electromagnetic shielding materials [19], catalysis and photocatalysis [20–22], electrodes, sensors [23, 24], therapeutic agents [25–28], and substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [29]. Meanwhile, different delaminated, multi-layered (ML) MXenes as well as MXene-based composites have found their niche in the area of water treatment and environmental remediation applications including ion separation membranes [30–32], heavy metal removal [33, 34], capacitive deionization [35], antimicrobial coatings [36], and photocatalytic degradation.\nThe previously mentioned wet chemistry synthesis routes result in ML and few layer (with proper delamination) flakes of MXene with surface functional groups. These functional groups (-OH, -O, or F) can react with the environment and affect the long-term stability of MXenes, posing a major obstacle toward scale-up and commercialization of MXene products. Pristine MXene flakes degrade by forming oxides when exposed to oxygen in the presence of water or when operating at high temperatures [37, 38]. The layered structure characteristic of MXene is destroyed during oxidation due to gradual nucleation of titanium dioxide (TiO2) crystals at the edges of flakes and over time forming TiO2 on carbon sheets. The oxidation of MXene to TiO2 precipitates corresponds to visual changes in solution color from translucent greenish-black to a cloudy white [2, 37]. Few approaches have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of MXene stability in aqueous media. Several MXene-based composites, for example, have been developed with the hope to impart a synergistic effect by reducing agglomeration, providing conductive pathways, and improving overall stability [36].\nThis chapter will focus on MXenes potential for environmental remediation applications including water purification using membrane separation, photocatalytic, and adsorptive properties. Bactericidal properties, toxicity, and environmental impact of MXenes will also be discussed."

      "heading" : "MXenes for Water Treatment Membranes",
      "text" : "Membrane desalination and water purification technologies have become more practical and energy-efficient means to secure freshwater resources globally. Ideal desalination and water treatment membranes should provide high flux, proper selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to fouling throughout their usable\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 419\nlifespan. Also, membranes should be thin yet mechanically stable to maximize water permeability and consistent salt rejection. Two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and graphene oxide (GO), have demonstrated exceptional performance as membranes with properties such as ultrahigh water flux, molecular and ionic sieving capability, and strong resistance to biofouling [39]. The layered structure and composition of MXenes provide unique advantages as water treatment materials like hydrophilicity, electronic and ionic conductivity, remarkable flexibility and mechanical stability, tunable interlayer spacing, and high accessible surface area.\nThe first MXene water treatment membrane was prepared by vacuum-assisted filtration (VAF) of MXene colloidal suspension on a hydrophilic substrate with a pore size below 0.50 μm. MXene sheets are easily assembled into layered stacks with a well-defined interlayer distance, which can act as selective transport channels. Nanometer-thin MXene sheets were stacked into a film with a 1.2 μm cross-section supported on a PVDF membrane, which was used for the charge- and size selective rejection of ions and molecules (Fig. 22.1(i)) [32]. The membrane also showed a water flux of ~37.4 L Bar−1 h−1 m−2, separating ions ranging both in hydration radius and charge. The membrane showed high selectivity toward single-, doubleand triple-charged metal cations and different dye cations.\nMultiple-charged cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) with radii smaller than the interlayer spacing of MXene layers (∼6.4 Å based on XRD) were able to\n420 K. Rasool et al.\nmigrate between the interlayer capillary pathways, causing an initial increase in the interlayer spacing. Further intercalation of ions eventually leads to shrinkage due to electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged MXene surface and the highly charged cations, as illustrated in Fig. 22.1(ii). This shrinkage results in slower permeation rates observed for the multiple-charged ions. Meanwhile monovalent ions such as (Na+) are able to move between the membrane layers and form an electric double layer on both sides of the channel, leading to repulsion of MXene sheets and enabling higher permeation rates (7–25 times faster than double- and triple-charged ions). Consequentially, the hydrophilic nature of MXene and the presence of water layers between the sheets promote high water flux. Ti3C2Tx membranes have demonstrated a higher performance than GO in the separation of higher charged cations.\nSolvent-resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes were prepared by incorporating Ti3C2Tx into two typical polymeric matrixes: hydrophilic polyethyleneimine (PEI) and hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). In these composites, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets were horizontally aligned in the polymer matrix, generating obvious interference with polymer chain motion, promoting the transport of alcohol molecules by providing additional pathways along the surface of nanosheets via –OH adsorption sites (Fig. 22.2).\nSteric effects and interfacial interactions of the uniformly dispersed Ti3C2Tx enhanced the thermal and mechanical stability, as well as solvent resistance of these polymer-MXene composite membranes. Alcohol flux of polymer-MXene composite membranes demonstrated 30% improvement compared to PEI membrane and 162% to PDMS membrane. At the same time, the rejection abilities have been significantly improved with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCOs) below 200 Da due to solute transfer blockage by the nanosheets [40].\nAnother lamellar membrane was prepared by tailoring the interspacing between MXene sheets in order to achieve a higher flux and improved selectivity of ion rejection. The membrane was prepared by intercalation of positively charged\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 421\nFe(OH)3 in the negatively charged MXene nanosheets followed by vacuum filtration on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) substrate. Transport pathways were obtained by dissolving Fe(OH)3 nanoparticles (NPs) by hydrochloric acid solution (HCl) (Fig. 22.3) [41]. After removing Fe(OH)3, the membrane exhibited a remarkable water permeance of 1084 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 and a high rejection rate of 90% for Evans blue (EB), which was 5 and 10 times higher than that of the pristine MXene membrane and the membrane before removing Fe(OH)3 NPs, respectively. Membrane thickness also affected the rejection performance as a 0.8-μm-thick membrane exhibited 100% rejection of EB, cytochrome (Cyt. c) molecules, and 5 nm gold NPs. The membrane maintained its durability, rejection efficiency, and water permeance for over 28 h of continuous filtration. However, the major drawback of this type of membrane is the limited size range for rejection with low rejection of salts.\nVarious MXene-based membranes were prepared via VAF, the first example being MXene-based membrane filtered onto a polyethersulfone (PES) support. The prepared ultrafiltration membrane shows water flux of 115 L m−2 h−1 and 92.3% rejection of Congo red dye at 0.1 MPa pressure [30]. Another type of ultrathin 2D\n422 K. Rasool et al.\nMXene membrane was prepared for pervaporation desalination application [42]. The polyacrylonitrile (PAN) supported MXene with ~60 nm thickness showed 85.4 L m−2 h−1 water permeation and 99.5% NaCl rejection at 65 ◦C. Moreover, this membrane exhibited long-term durability and performance in a synthetic seawater system, highlighting the potential of MXene-based materials in the water treatment field.\nRecently, a MXene composite membrane modified by silver NPs (AgNPs) was developed in an attempt to improve water permeation and antifouling properties [31]. AgNPs-modified MXene membrane (Ag@MXene) was prepared by selfreduction of silver nitrate on the surface of MXene sheets in aqueous medium. SEM images (surface and cross-section) of the PVDF substrate, pristine MXene, and 21% Ag@MXene composite membranes are given in Fig. 22.4(i). Crosssectional SEM image of the 21% Ag@MXene composite membrane exhibited layer by layer stacking of MXene nanosheets followed by stacking of AgNPs between the sheets (Fig. 22.4(i(d))). AgNPs attached on the surface of MXene created slit interspacing between the MXene nanosheets to provide additional\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 423\nnanopores for water permeation as shown in Fig. 22.4(ii). The 21% Ag@MXene membrane showed improved water flux (~420 L m−2 h−1 bar−1) and rejection of methyl green (MG) (92.32%) and Rhodamine B (RhB) (79.93%) (Fig. 22.4(iii(a, b))). Additionally, the antibacterial activity of the 21% Ag@MXene composite membrane was studied and shown to inhibit the growth of more than 99% of E. coli on the membrane surface.\nWater transport phenomena through layered 2D nanostructures including MXenes have been subjected to several theoretical and experimental investigations. Among the different computational methods, density functional theory (DFT) has been proven to be an effective method for describing a variety of unprecedented mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of MXene family materials, despite the complex structure of MXene consisting of light/heavy transition metals and organics. DFT has been used to explore water and ion transport through Ti3C2(OH)2 MXene [43, 44]. A particular focus was given to find the origin for charge selective ionic sieving through the material, which was related to surface charges of the material [32]. Charge calculations using the density derived electrostatic and chemical charges method showed the negative charges on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. A simple model, consisting of MXene bilayer and intercalating ions with the first hydration shell (Fig. 22.5(a–c)), was used to study the effect of the surface charges on the ionic sieving. The results show that the interlayer distance “d” decreases with increasing the charge state of the ions due to electrostatic interactions. Such a dynamic response of the bilayer MXene to intercalating ions was also obtained in the following DFT molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by the same authors [45]. The obtained results show the importance of surface functionalization in practical applications of MXenes in water treatment.\nReactive force field (ReaxFF) model was proposed for Ti3C2(OH)2 MXene [46], which in contrast to classical force fields [47, 48] is a general bond-order dependent potential that accounts for dynamic formation and dissociation of chemical bonds during the simulations. The ReaxFF was used to study theoretically the dynamics of water molecules in MXene membranes using MD simulations to address the stability of these membranes in hydrogenous media [46]. The calculated diffusion coefficient of water in such a confined space was in good agreement with the experiment. The ReaxFF MD simulations also predicted the reduction of the water self-diffusion coefficient by 2 orders of magnitude after the intercalation of potassium ions between the interlayer spacing. This indicates to enhanced operational stability of MXene against delamination after ion intercalation. The predicted dynamic response of MXene layers to intercalating ions (i.e., reduced c-L parameter) after ion intercalation (see Fig. 22.6) is in good agreement with DFT MD simulations [45].\n424 K.

      "text" : "Understanding the antibacterial characteristics is an important success criterion for efficient application of MXene in environmental remediation and water treatment applications. The antibacterial activity of single- and few-layer Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes in colloidal solution against E. coli and B. subtilis was first revealed by our group [49]. It was concluded that Ti3C2Tx can be effectively used to inhibit bacterial growth as shown in Fig. 22.7. The antibacterial activity of Ti3C2Tx MXene was compared with GO, for both bacterial strains. Ti3C2Tx MXene showed higher bactericidal activity as compared to GO (Fig. 22.7i(a, b)), and Ti3C2Tx dispersions revealed much stronger antibacterial activity against B. subtilis than that of E. coli.\nContrary to Ti3C2, the antibacterial activity of Ti2C MXene did not show any significant bactericidal effects against gram-positive bacteria [50]. In a separate investigation, layered Ti2C and Ti3C2 sheets were synthesized from their Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2 MAX precursors, respectively, by HF etching, and their bioactivities\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 425\nwere compared against gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive (Bacillus sp., S. aureus, and Sarcina) bacteria [51]. Given the similar chemical composition of Ti2C and Ti3C2, it was unclear if and how the different stoichiometry would influence their bioactivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the interlayer distance in Ti2C was larger than Ti3C2 by 0.53 Å. It turned out that Ti2C had a minimal effect on the growth of gram-positive Bacillus sp., S. aureus, and Sarcina strains, and no bactericidal effect was observed against E. coli bacteria. On the other hand, Ti3C2 showed strong bactericidal properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, the changes in the structure of MXene at the atomic scale may have played a key role in their bioactivity. The anti-biofouling characteristics of micrometer-thick Ti3C2Tx membrane coatings were evaluated using colony count method and demonstrated significant inhibition of E. coli and B. subtilis growth on the membrane surface as shown by Fig. 22.8. Surprisingly, aged Ti3C2Tx membrane showed over 99% growth inhibition of both bacteria, much higher than that of fresh MXene coated membranes showing that partial oxidation of Ti3C2Tx membrane is beneficial to increase the overall antibacterial properties [52]. The antibacterial activity of the aged membrane surface was initially hypothesized to decrease due to membrane surface oxidation. However, the formation of TiO2 nanocrystals on the Ti3C2Tx membrane surface enhanced antibacterial performance. In another study, the antibacterial response and mechanical properties of MXenes have been enhanced by decorating AgNPs on MXene surface as shown earlier by in situ Ag reduction on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets [31]. This study showed excellent anti-biofouling response of 21% Ag@MXene composite membrane against E. coli strain, which was much more pronounced compared to that of the pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene membranes. Enhanced bactericidal activity was attributed to the formation of AgNPs and TiO2 NPs onto the MXene surface. It is important to note that there are several factors including synthesis methods and conditions such as nature of\n426 K. Rasool et al.\nMXene precursors, presence of different impurities, coexistence of different MAX phases, etching protocol, type of intercalants, stability, and temperature, which affect the physicochemical properties of MXenes and thus their performance in different applications [53].\nThere are several important aspects that could influence the antibacterial performance of MXenes including lateral size, shape, number of layers, surface modification, agglomeration, and dispersion. The shape of several nanomaterials such as AgNPs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene is reported to have a significant effect on their antimicrobial characteristics as it directly impacts the physical interaction between nanosheets, the bacterial membrane, and across the lipid bilayer [54]. Similar to graphene, the bactericidal properties of MXenes might be affected by the number of stacked sheets in a flake upon delamination [55]. Poor delamination can result in ML nanosheets, weakening the “nano-knife” effect, and aggregation of the nanosheets. It was found that MXene flakes with sharp corners and edges, analogues to graphene sheets, can easily impale the bacterial cell membrane [56]. Nevertheless, further investigations of the antibacterial mechanism of different type of MXenes are needed to determine the range of potential applications of these new materials. Similar to graphene, three major mechanisms can be proposed for MXene’s bactericidal activity—(i) oxidative stress induced with and/or without the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), (ii) nano-knives derived from the action of sharp edges, and (iii) wrapping or trapping bacterial membranes [55, 57–61]. Oxidative stress has been reported as a common mechanism of antibacterial activity of several nanomaterials other than 2D graphene [55]. The production and impact of ROS in MXenes are not well studied and need to be exclusively investigated. As for ROS-independent stress, glutathione serves as one of the major cellular antioxidant enzymes in bacteria, and its oxidation in the presence of different nanomaterials has been widely used as an indicator of the nanomaterial’s induced oxidative stress. Loss of glutathione was observed after reaction with Ti3C2Tx MXene possibly due to chemical reactions and/or physi-sorption [49]. Currently, there is no data available on thiols interaction with Ti3C2Tx and/or any other MXene. Further investigations\n428 K. Rasool et al.\nare needed to explore the possible mechanism associated with oxidative stress. The proposed mechanisms are physical damage of the cell membrane by direct contact of the MXene nanosheets followed by generation of ROS [49, 52]. More investigations of antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of different members of MXenes family using experimental and theoretical simulations are urgently needed. A systematic study of the experimental conditions (i.e., pH, temperature), degree of MXene delamination, intercalation, terminations, and potential impurities should also be done for a wholesome understanding of those parameters on the bactericidal activity."

      "heading" : "MXenes for Photocatalytic Applications",
      "text" : "MXenes can also be used for photocatalytic applications by altering their surface chemistries [62]. Even though some MXenes show narrow band-gap semiconducting behavior, their band-gap can be tuned by altering their surface termination groups (F, OH, or O) or by arranging the surface groups relative to the M atoms to satisfy the requirements for photocatalysis applications. For example, Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2(OH)2 can be narrow band-gap semiconductors depending on how the surface groups (F or OH) are geometrically terminated [62, 63]. Theoretical investigations were carried out to study the structural, electronic, and optical properties of M2CT2 MXenes (where M = Ti, Zr, and Hf and T = F, O, and OH) with different geometries [64]. It was found that the M2CT2 MXenes with functional groups located above the opposite side of metal atoms have the largest cohesive energies and, therefore, are most energetically favorable. For this kind of MXene, the valence band maxima (VBM) is mainly composed of p orbitals of carbon atoms, while the conduction band minima (CBM) consists of M-d (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) states. Hence, the M2CT2 with the functional groups locating above the opposite side metal atoms have suitable band gaps (0.92 ~ 1.75 eV), visible-light absorption, high redox potential of photo-induced holes, efficient separation of electron-hole pairs, and exceptional carrier mobilities. All of these properties make this functionalized MXene suitable for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and water splitting technologies. Based on DFT and deformation potential theory, 2D Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 were considered promising photocatalysts for water splitting due to their remarkable anisotropic carrier mobility, strong optical absorption in both visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, and their stability in aqueous media [65]. Another DFT study demonstrated that Ti2CO2 and W2CO2 MXenes are the highly active catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on number of HER active sites, conductivity, and intrinsic catalytic activity [66]. Among different MXenes (Sc2CF2, Sc2CO2, and Sc2C(OH)2) with the same energetically favorable geometries, Sc2CF2 had appropriate band structure and higher redox capability of photoactivated carriers, which leads to a better photocatalytic performance [67].\nThe first experimental attempt have used ML Ti3C2Tx MXene as a potential photo-catalyst for the degradation of MB and acid blue 80 [37]. MB was degraded\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 429\nby 81% while interacting with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) under UV within 5 h, whereas only 18% degradation occurred in the dark. Up to 62% of acid blue was degraded after interacting with MXene under UV within 5 h. On the other hand, no degradation occurred in the dark even after 20 h. The formation of titanium hydroxide and/or TiO2 on the surface of MXene contributed to the photocatalytic effect under UV illumination. Nevertheless, the photo-catalytic activity of MXene is still limited due to fast recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, narrow lightabsorption range, and limited stability in oxygen-obtained water [63]. This is most likely due to the presence of free electrons in the carbide layer of MXene beneath the oxide surface [68]. To overcome these disadvantages, TiO2/Ti3C2 nanocomposites have been synthesized and evaluated to determine the enhancement in photocatalytic activity by photodegradation of methyl orange under ultraviolet light irradiation [69]. Nanocomposites showed higher photocatalytic activity of 98% than individual TiO2 (77%) and Ti3C2 (42%). The increased photocatalytic performance can be attributed to more effective electron-hole separation in the composite system relative to pristine TiO2 and Ti3C2 samples under UV light irradiation, which may be due to the formation of a Ti3C2 and TiO2 heterojunction.\nTiO2/Ti3C2Tx composites have been used for the production of hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting [70]. In the TiO2/Ti3C2Tx composite, Ti3C2Tx provides a 2D platform for intimate interactions with TiO2 NPs and acts as an electron sink to promote the separation of photo-generated charge carriers. The photocatalytic performance of this material varies with the Ti3C2Tx content in the system. It was suggested that the intimate contact between TiO2 and Ti3C2Tx is essential for efficient charge transfer. Hence, the composites prepared by a hydrothermal route possess higher hydrogen yield in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction than physical mixing methods. Around 400% enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction was found for the TiO2/Ti3C2Tx (5 wt%) composite in comparison with pure rutile TiO2 under visible-light irradiation. Here, the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen yield can be attributed mainly to the intrinsic properties of the metal carbide co-catalyst in the photocatalytic system.\nGenerally, in photocatalytic applications, exposing the highly active facets to the photoexcitation source has been regarded as a powerful approach to develop high-performance photocatalysts. It has been established that the (001) facet is the most active facet in TiO2 nanosheets, and coupling TiO2 nanosheets having (001) facets with other 2D materials can enhance photocatalytic activity effectively [60, 71, 72]. The photocatalytic performance of a composite comprised of (001) facets of TiO2 nanosheets and layered Ti3C2 has been fabricated and evaluated [73]. The highly active (001) facets of TiO2 in the composite can afford high-efficiency photogeneration of electron-hole pairs, as well as the carrier separation promoted by hole trapping effect by the interfacial Schottky junction with 2D Ti3C2, which acts as a reservoir of holes. DFT calculations show that the interface formation originates from the overlapping of the Ti d orbital and the O p orbital, as shown in Fig. 22.9a, b. The photocatalytic activity of the (001) TiO2/Ti3C2 toward photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye was evaluated under ultraviolet irradiation and found 2.3-fold higher degradation than that of particulateTiO2/ Ti3C2. Since the\n430 K. Rasool et al.\nFermi level of Ti3C2 is more negative than the conduction band of TiO2, the transfer of electrons is forbidden at the interfaces between TiO2 (001) surfaces and Ti3C2. Also, the work function of –OH terminated Ti3C2 sheets (1.8 eV) is much lower than that of TiO2 (4.924 eV for (001) surface, 6.578 eV for (101) surface). A Schottky barrier may be established through their interfaces, and the photogenerated holes instead of electrons could be injected from TiO2 to Ti3C2-OH. The formed Schottky barrier at TiO2/Ti3C2 interfaces could effectively prevent the holes from flowing back to TiO2 (Fig. 22.9c). The (001) TiO2-Ti3C2 hybrid provides enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange by overcoming the problems of fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes and the utilization of highly active {001} facets of TiO2.\nA hybrid of 2D Ti3C2 and Ti3+-doped rutile TiO2 exposing (111) facets has been evaluated for its photocatalytic activity in removing pollutants from water under visible irradiation [74]. The transformation of TiO2 octahedrons from (110) facets to (111) facets was increased by increasing the NH4F concentration during the synthesis process. In addition, the treatment of hydrazine hydrate induces the lattice vacancy by embedding the Ti3+ dopant within the bulk of TiO2 without affecting its\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 431\ncrystallographic structure and morphology. Here, the Ti3+ doping narrows the bandgap and the exposure of highly active (111) facets, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the composite. Moreover, Ti3C2 NPs have been used as highly active cocatalysts on metal sulfide photo-absorbers for enhanced visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production [75]. Hydrothermal reaction strategy was used to replace the – F terminations on Ti3C2 by –O/–OH terminations and coupled with cadmium sulfide to form a highly fused CdS/Ti3C2 composite photocatalyst. This photocatalyst displayed super-high-visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 14,342 μmol h−1 g−1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.1% at 420 nm. This enhanced photocatalytic performance arises from the favorable Fermi level position, electrical conductivity, and hydrogen evolution capacity of Ti3C2 nanosheets. The work toward the development of MXene-based nano-architectures gives a basic understanding about how to design a well-contacted heterojunction interface between MXenes and the other NPs in order to achieve a superior photoredox efficiency in photocatalysis and energy conversion applications."

      "text" : "MXenes and their composites demonstrate strong ability to intercalate several ions. A number of cations such as Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, and Al3+ and organic molecules (such as hydrazine, urea, and dimethyl sulfoxide) are easily intercalated between Ti3C2 MXene layers revealing the potential of MXenes to be used as adsorbents [5, 76]. In the past few years, MXene-based nanocomposites have been reported as effective adsorbents for several pollutants from different water/wastewater streams [77]. Ti3C2Tx MXene is the most utilized model in this field of study. Several theoretical studies based on DFT and modeling computations are performed to investigate the adsorption of various pollutants on MXene nanosheets [78]. The capacity of ML-Ti3C2 MXene toward adsorption of cationic dye methylene blue (MB) has been demonstrated. An increase in interlayer spacing was observed due to stacking disorder and formation of titania, showing MXene oxidation after adsorption [37]. MXene has also shown excellent adsorption ability for several heavy metals (such as lead, copper, and chromium) [33]. The pollutant can be adsorbed on MXene surface by interacting with OH− or F− groups [79, 80].\nAlkaline-MXene (Ti3C2(OH/ONa)xF2−x), with activated hydroxyl group on Ti3C2, exhibited selective sorption of Pb2+. Sorption equilibrium was achieved in a short time of 120 s in presence of high concentrations of competing cations like Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 22.10) [81]. The adsorption of Pb2+ onto Alkaline-MXene was assigned to the presence of abundance activated Ti-OH sites.\nIn another study, theoretical prediction of heavy-metals adsorption behavior onto Alkaline-MXene was presented based on the first-principles calculations [82]. The formation of the hydrogen potential trap around the adsorbed heavy metal atom provided enough opposite-spin electron pairs to catch Pb2+ atom forming stable\n432 K. Rasool et al.\nTi3C2(O2H2−2m) chemical bonds (Fig. 22.11). Theoretically, the ion adsorption efficiency of Alkaline-MXene decreases with increased occupation of the F atom; however, an increase in Pb2+ adsorption was calculated by the intercalation of Li2+, Na+, and K+ atoms into Alkaline-MXene nanosheets layers. Additionally, heavy metal ions could be potentially removed via an ion exchange process using AlkalineMXene as its surface. The presence of hydroxyl ions makes it an attractive choice to remove toxic metals ions [83].\nThe narrow interlayer spacing below 2 Å in between the nanosheets is a major challenge for using MXene in high-capacity pollutant removal. Such narrow spacing hinders the accessibility of pollutants with large hydrated radii. Intercalation of small organic molecules and/or cations into the structure of MXene not only improves the interaction affinities of surface anchored functional groups to inner channel walls but can also overcome the problem of narrow interlayer spacing by expanding the c-lattice parameter (c-LP) of MXene [5]. Likewise, the presence\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 433\nof hydrophilic groups and weak bonding forces in hydrated MXene can bind a greater number of water molecules, resulting in reversible increase of c-LP [32]. Alkalization of MXene can significantly accelerate the removal of metal ions [84]. Thus far, experimental work on Pb2+ removal by MXene is limited only to Ti3C2Tx MXene. The effect of M2X(OH)2 structures (where M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, and X is carbide or nitride) on the adsorption behavior of Pb2+ was investigated theoretically by the first principles calculations [85]. The formation energies of Pb2+ adsorption on M2N(OH)2 are higher as compared to M2C(OH)2, suggesting that the transitional metal nitride is more effective than that of carbides for heavy metal adsorption. Additionally, theoretical modeling confirmed Ti2C(OH)2 as the most favorable MXene nanomaterial for heavy metal sequestration. Alternative M2X(OH)2 structures showed the ability to remove Pb2+\n434 K. Rasool et al.\nexcept Sc2C(OH)2 and Zr2C(OH)2 structures. Molecular dynamics simulation are performed to investigate the adsorption behavior of Pb2+ and Cu2+ on V2C and Ti2C MXenes. A theoretical Pb2+ adsorption capacity of 2560 mg g−1 Ti2C MXene is predicted [86].\nDelaminated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets demonstrated distinctive in situ reduction ability of several metal ions including Cu, Ag, and Cr(VI) [33, 34, 87], opening a new promising function of MXene materials for environmental pollutant removal. It was found that highly delaminated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets efficiently and rapidly reduced Cr (VI) to Cr (III) followed by simultaneous adsorption of reduced Cr (III) from aqueous solution due to presence of plentiful oxygen-containing OH and F groups (Fig. 22.12a). In another study, delaminated Ti3C2Tx MXene showed a promise for reductive Cu2+ removal where oxygenated moieties in the layered structure of MXene enabled reduction of Cu2+ to Cu2O and CuO followed by adsorption of reduced products. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx demonstrated high adsorption capacity which was 2.7 times higher than that of a commercially available activated carbon [33].\nA novel urchin-like rutile TiO2-C/TiC (u-RTC) nanocomposite was synthesized by in situ decomposition of Ti3C2 MXene in ethylene glycol, FeCl3, and isopropyl alcohol solution [88]. The u-RTC nanocomposite showed a selective adsorption capacity of 225 mg g−1 for Cr (VI) removal, which was much higher than that of the pristine MXene (62 mg g−1) in presence of high concentrations of various anions such as Cl−, SO42−, and NO3−. High sorption selectivity toward Cr (VI) was assigned to the strong inner-sphere complexation between u-RTC and Cr2O72− ions. Moreover, u-RTC composite maintained recyclability and performance for removing Cr (VI) from real industrial wastewater with adsorption capacity of 1120 kg kg−1, fulfilling the criteria of drinking water (0.01 mg L−1) by WHO [88].\nMXene stability and recyclability have been reported to be improved by functionalization of MXene surfaces to achieve magnetic properties, providing a simple and effective method for adsorbate separation, recycling, and reuse. Sandwiched MXene-iron oxide (MXI) nanocomposite was synthesized for phosphate removal by intercalating ultrafine maghemite-Fe2O3 into the layered MXene nanosheets, resulting in a higher number of Ti-OH groups and increased interlayer distance coupled with high magnetic separation force [77, 89]. This sandwiched structure provided Fe-OH exchange sites and improved phosphate sorption selectivity with fast adsorption kinetics and simple separation feasibility by regenerating the exhausted adsorbent (Fig. 22.12b) [77]. The MXI nanocomposite exhibited higher selective adsorption capacity of 2400 kg-phosphate/kg-MXI in presence of common competitive anions such as SO42−, Cl−, and NO3−. In another study, very stable magnetic Ti3C2Tx MXene (MGMX) nanocomposite with super-magnetic properties was synthesized by depositing Fe2O3 onto the surfaces of Ti3C2Tx using a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method [89]. The super-magnetic nanocomposite was used for efficient removal of mercuric ions from aqueous solutions and real industrial wastewater (Fig. 22.13).The composite effectively removed Hg(II) with maximum adsorption capacity of 1128.41 mg g−1, considerably higher than other 2D nanomaterials [89]. Such high adsorption capacity of the MGMX nanocomposite\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 435\nwas to be attributed to the presence of different functional moieties such as Ti3C2-Fx, Ti3C2-Ox, and Ti3C2-(OH)x. The MGMX nanocomposite was reused for five adsorption-desorption cycles to investigate the recyclability of the nanocomposite. MGMX nanocomposite showed better recyclability than pristine MXene with more than 90% mercury removal in the four consecutive cycles.\n436 K. Rasool et al.\nMXenes have been proposed recently for the removal of the radionuclides from nuclear wastes for their good radioresistance and thermal structural stability [90, 91]. DFT has predicted the efficient removal of uranyl ion by adsorption onto Ti3C2(OH)2 and V2CTx MXene nanosheets [90]. Chemical interaction between uranyl and Ti3C2(OH)2 in presence of anionic ligands such as OH−, Cl−, and NO3− was found to be strong enough to form stable chemical bonds, showing the imperative role of chemical interaction and the hydrogen bonding in the adsorption process [78]. Experimental demonstration of U(VI) adsorption on hydrated Ti3C2Tx was studied as depicted in the Fig. 22.14 [92]. In this study, ML-MXene was synthesized under hydrated conditions to produce intercalated Ti3C2Tx-NaOH and Ti3C2Tx-DMSO MXenes with a significant increase in interlayer spacing with by expanding the c lattice parameter up to 20.18 Å. Adsorption of representative actinide U(VI) on DMSO hydrated MXene to obtain a maximum adsorption capacity of 214 mg g−1, five times higher than that for pristine Ti3C2Tx. Theoretical adsorption capacity of U(VI) on hydrated Ti3C2Tx was calculated to be as high as 595.3 mg g−1 [78]; however, experimental adsorption observed was roughly 54.5% of the theoretical value. It is notable that the zeta potentials of both pristine and intercalated Ti3C2Tx were the same, eliminating any role of electrostatic interaction in adsorption process.\n22 MXenes for Environmental and Water Treatment Applications 437\nIn a recent study, the adsorption of uranyl ions [UO2(H2O)n]2+ onV2CTx MXene from aqueous solution was first time reported with an adsorption capacity of 174 mg g−1, better than several conventional inorganic nanomaterials [92]. Uranium adsorption onto V2CTx was heterogeneous by the formation of bidentate innersphere complexes, with hydroxyl groups attached to V atoms followed by an ion-exchange mechanism (Fig. 22.14). Moreover, insight into chemical interaction of V2CTx with uranium species was projected by mathematical modeling, proposing the maximum uranium adsorption capacity of 536 mg g−1 on V2C(OH)2 nanosheets to be much higher than the experimental removal performance [91]. Material optimization can still be done to increase adsorptive removal efficiency of uranium species. U(VI) is in the form of the uranyl ion, UO22+ and mononuclear and polynuclear hydroxo-complexes in aqueous solutions and forms mononuclear and polynuclear carbonato- and hydroxo-complexes in presence of carbonate anions [93]. These uranyl ion species are abundantly present in natural environmental\n438 K. Rasool et al.\nconditions. All aquo-, hydroxylated, and carbonated uranyl species depicted strong adsorption performance on hydroxylated V2CTx nanosheets; however, aqua-uranyl species showed the strongest adsorptive properties due to strong bonding between uranyl ions and OH of hydroxylated MXene.\nMost of the above studies on uranium removal by MXene are predicted by computational studies using DFT, and there is a little evidence of practical applications. This implies the need for more advance experimental verification to use MXenes for nuclear waste management in the future."

      "text" : "In summary, this chapter provides an overview on the recent advancements of single and multilayered MXenes in water treatment and environmental remediation applications including separation membranes, photocatalytic substrates, adsorbents, and antimicrobial agents. Also, numerous MXene-based composites have been developed with the hope to overcome the shortcomings of the pristine MXenes such as stability and at the same time impart synergistic effects to reduce agglomeration and provide conductive pathways. Thus far, Ti3C2Tx is the most utilized form of MXenes in water treatment and environmental remediation applications. To our knowledge, there is no experimental data available on the use other MXenes for adsorption of pollutants. MXenes have been used extensively for the reductive sequestration and/or adsorption of heavy metals from water and degradation of dyes.\nModification of MXenes could overcome their instability and improve their recyclability and biocompatibility, which would maximize their effectiveness in water treatment applications. Besides the well-demonstrated size and charge selective ion sieving using MXene membranes, good biocidal activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria provide antifouling capabilities of the membranes. More efforts are still needed to fully explore the antibacterial potential and understand the mechanisms of MXene antimicrobial activities. Despite a limited number of studies about antimicrobial properties of MXenes, it is expected that the proposed mechanisms are analogous to graphene. Moreover, a life cycle analysis still needs to be done to assess the environmental hazards of MXenes from the point of production to their exposure into wastewater streams.\nPristine MXenes have some disadvantages toward photocatalytic applications such as poor photon absorption and high rate of charge carrier recombination. However, there are plenty of possibilities for MXenes to be used as efficient photocatalysts by changing their surface chemistry. MXene-based nanoarchitectures with higher light harvesting ability, satisfied quantum efficiency, and enhanced carrier separation can be used for efficient solar to chemical applications.\nMXenes are quickly positioned among the most promising 2D nanomaterials being developed for various applications.

      "text" : "Status quo: MXenes have in the last couple of years emerged as potential materials that could enable chemical transformations of relevance for achieving a sustainable energy future. This, for example, includes generation of clean fuels and chemicals such as production of hydrogen. In this chapter we introduce some of the so far studied chemistries of these MXene materials focusing on several catalytic reactions. As one of the first catalytic applications, MXenes were explored for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [1, 2]. Both experimental techniques and computational tools have been utilized to discover properties of MXenes. One example of a combination between the computational and experimental efforts is the HER study in Ref. [1] where several M2X MXenes were computationally predicted to be HER active and experimentally synthesized and tested confirming the computational findings. It was, in particular, noticed that the basal planes of these active materials are functionalized under operating conditions [3]. In a followup study, it was demonstrated that the HER activity is highly sensitive to the details of the functional groups and that the functionalization can be experimentally tuned to a certain extent by controlling the type and concentration of the etching agent [4]. Recently more chemically and geometrically complex MXenes have been extensively studied for HER [3–19] and for other increasingly complicated electrochemical as well as thermal processes.\nL. R.

Vojvodic\nMXenes have experimentally been considered for both the electrochemical oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction (ORR) reactions [20–23]. Very recently, the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction has garnered some interest and has been computationally explored on M2X and M3X2 MXenes [24, 25]. Several computational studies have examined the reactivity of MXenes for CO2 abatement and their activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction to different CHx and CHxOy species [26–28]. More complex systems than the single-metal-based stoichiometric MnXn−1 MXenes including multi-metal alloys and MXenes combined as catalysts or supports with other materials have also obtained attention due to their potential interesting chemical properties. Such examples are systems consisting of metal adatoms on the MXenes which have been theoretically and experimentally explored for thermal CO oxidation [29, 30]. Nanoparticles of Ru and Rh supported on MXenes have been studied for hydrolysis of sodium borohydride and hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols, respectively [31, 32]. Bimetallic nanoparticles on MXenes have been investigated for hydrogen production from hydrous hydrazine [33]. Mo2C nanoparticles embedded via electrospinning in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers have been studied as catalysts for both the HER and ORR [21]. Studies have also shown that Ti3C2 in addition to TiO2 and Cu2O composites derived from MXenes can be used to catalyze thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate and dehydrogenation of sodium alanates [34–37]. Another group of chemical reactions where MXenes might play a crucial role are photoelectrochemical reactions [5, 9, 10, 16, 19, 38–43]. While observation of different chemistries on MXenes has gained momentum over a short time period, the fundamental understanding of their chemistries is still in its infancy. We next present results from computational efforts on our current atomic-scale understanding of the MXenes as well as discuss potential ways to enhance or hinder reactions on MXenes."

      "text" : "As always with chemistries of novel materials, independently if they are 3D or 2D, there is a need to first establish reactivity measures of the surface if dealing with a 3D material or the basal plane in the case of a 2D material in order to gain an understanding of the most basic elementary steps of a reaction, which involve adsorption of chemical species that are the different intermediates of the chemical reaction of interest. In other words, a common approach is to first establish thermodynamic data before proceeding to chemical activity and selectivity measures and trends, which are many orders or magnitude more computationally costly and can in some cases be prohibited due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. Of course, more levels of complexity of the material itself can be introduced to tune and control the chemistry of interest by varying the chemical compositions of the adsorption site as well as the geometry of the adsorption site through different surface facets, edges, and kinks to name a few. One promising suggested aspect of MXenes is that their chemistry might be taking place on the basal planes at least for\n23 Chemistry and Catalysis of MXenes 447\ncertain reactions. This is in contrast to some of the other well-known 2D materials such as MoS2 where the HER catalysis is occurring on the edges of nanoparticles [44] which has proven to be a challenge in terms of scalability. MXenes on the other hand have been synthesized with high surface areas and computationally identified to be basal plane active for HER [2, 4].\nTo calculate the adsorption energy, one typically uses the following equation:\nEa = Ema − Em − ∑\ni\nNiEa(g)\nwhere Ema is the energy of a species adsorbed on the MXene, Em is the energy of a clean MXene system, and Ea(g) is the energy of gas species corresponding to the adsorbate. The adsorption free energy is calculated as:\nGa = Ea + ∑\ni\nNi ( ZPEi − T Si)\nwhere zero-point energies and entropies are computed using DFT and tabulated gas phase thermodynamic data. We first exemplify how reactive bare MXenes are by discussing results from studies where the focus has been on adsorption of different intermediates including atoms, radicals, and molecules on the unfunctionalized basal planes of MXenes as well as dissociation of simple molecules before moving to functionalized MXenes in the next section.\nOne of the first observations is that adsorption of most reaction intermediates (including atoms, radicals, and molecules) on the bare basal planes of MXene is strongly downhill in energy [24, 25, 28, 45, 46]. This by itself indicates the tendency of these bare MXenes to be terminated or passivated with functional groups. Hence, depending on the surrounding environment, these bare basal planes will be functionalized. This conclusion is further supported by reports where modeling dissociation kinetics of strongly bonded molecules such as N2 and CO2 on the bare basal planes of MXenes is possible with comparably low activation energies compared to other studied materials [24, 27]. For example, MXenes with the chemical formula M3C2 were shown to activate N2, and it was found that bare basal planes of V3C2 and Cr3C2 were possible candidate materials for two proposed N2 reaction mechanisms (see Fig. 23.1) [24]. Computational studies of CO2 reduction to different hydrocarbons also demonstrated activation of CO2 (see Fig. 23.2) [27]. In a recent study on CO2 uptake [28], it was confirmed that bare basal planes of MXenes can activate CO2 and that M2C MXenes are more active than the traditionally explored surfaces of bulk transition metal carbides and nitrides. To the best of our knowledge, experiments have so far not demonstrated existence of bare basal planes of MXenes, rather they find that the studied MXenes are terminated, decorated, or passivated with different amounts of functional groups on the basal plane which to a certain degree can be controlled by using different etching agents during the synthesis [4, 47–49]. In the next section, we discuss how functionalization of the basal planes can affect the MXene chemistry.\n448 L. R. Johnson and A. Vojvodic\n23 Chemistry and Catalysis of MXenes 449"

      "text" : "In order to obtain a complete picture of a chemical process on a material, one should take care in modeling the system under as realistic conditions as possible. This includes dealing with coverage effects of the reaction intermediates under different chemical conditions and environments. For electrochemical reactions, the modeling should also include the applied potential and pH. Using the computational hydrogen approach [50–52], one can construct so-called Pourbaix stability diagrams to determine the termination or phase of a material under certain conditions. Figure 23.3 shows such a constructed Pourbaix diagram for two prototypical MXenes, Ti2C and Mo2C, with different modeled functional groups and terminations (Tx) including one monolayer (ML) coverage of adsorbed H, 2 ML of H, 1 ML of O, and 1 ML of OH [3]. It is found that the most stable functional group (lowest line at a given applied potential) changes as the applied potential changes from O∗ to H∗ , 2H∗ , or 3H∗ with decreasing negative voltages. At ambient conditions with no applied potential, the two MXenes are predicted to be functionalized with oxygen. However, the exact functional group and termination are material dependent and can also show combinations of mixed functional groups, for example, partial O and OH coverage. In addition, there might be an effect of pH. Figure 23.4 shows the linear pH dependence on the stability and its small effect on the stability ordering between the different functional groups of relevance for HER [2]. Stability diagrams give a reasonable starting point for modeling the activity of a system; however, they might have to be revised in an iterative way during the simulations of more complex intermediates.\n450 L.

      "heading" : "High-Throughput Computational Screening of MXenes",
      "text" : "A strategy that has been more and more applied in the discovery of materials for different applications is both experimental and computational high-throughput screening. One successful road map in identifying catalyst material candidates computationally has been to first generate thermodynamic (energetics of reaction intermediates) and kinetic (activation including dissociation and association barriers) data of relevant reaction steps, which of course depend on the explicit reaction pathways that one has chosen to study. Next the generated data is used to establish correlations between energetics of different intermediates, on one hand, known as adsorbate energy scaling relations, and between thermodynamics and kinetics, on the other hand, known as transition state scaling relations. Assuming a reaction mechanism(s), one can then identify a descriptor(s) which is(are) parameter(s) to describe the overall reaction properties. This approach can help to reduce the parameter phase space of the reaction mechanism and intermediates and allow for faster high-throughput computational screening. Together with micro-kinetic modeling, one can also describe the trends in activity usually for thermal reactions by ordering the different materials on a so-called activity volcano heat map, which in some cases can take the form of an inverse parabola, with the earlier identified descriptor(s) as parameters. At the top of this volcano plot, one finds the best candidate materials exhibiting the highest activity for an optimal descriptor value. For electrochemical reactions, on the other hand, one can calculate the limiting potentials for each of the elementary steps. For example, in the case of electrochemical hydrogen evolution, it was shown initially for metal catalysts that the hydrogen adsorption free energy GH can be used as a descriptor for HER activity [53] and has since been shown for other classes of materials [44, 50, 54– 56]. Electrochemical activity volcano plots for HER are generated by plotting the negative overpotential as a function of the activity descriptor that is GH (see\n23 Chemistry and Catalysis of MXenes 451\nFig. 23.5). In general, the goal is to minimize the overpotential by finding the material with the ideal surface chemistry corresponding to an optimal descriptor value. The zoomed-in part of Fig. 23.5 reveals the top of the volcano with the best catalyst candidates for HER among the M2X MXenes. Despite that computationally both Hf2N and Sc2C are having among the lowest overpotentials those materials had not been experimentally synthesized at the time of the study. As the next best computationally best candidate MXene material for HER, one finds the Ofunctionalized Mo2C which is among the experimentally realized MXenes. Other studies have since used similar computational high-throughput screening methods to study the HER on MXenes with different chemical formulas including M3X2 and M4X3 with and without functional groups [8, 12, 13, 57]. In Ref. [50], a detailed discussion is provided on the HER activity trends as a function of the metal component, the nonmetal component, and the chemical formula of the MXene (see Fig. 23.6)."

      "text" : "The functionalization of the MXene has an effect on the chemical reactivity and hence also the catalytic activity of the MXenes material. One of the first demonstrations that the composition of the etching agent altered the functionalization was reported a couple of years ago [47]. The relationship between the functional groups and their impact on catalytic activity was identified both experimentally and computationally for HER in Ref. [4]. It was found that the experimentally measured overpotential changed (see Fig. 23.7) by changing the concentration of the etchant and type, HF vs LiF vs HCl, when synthesizing the MXenes from their\n452 L. R. Johnson and A. Vojvodic\ncorresponding MAX phase which was shown resulted from modifying the ratio of different functional groups as measured by XPS. The observed trend agrees with theoretical results, which found that an increase in the F to O functional group ratio yielded an increase in overpotential (see Fig. 23.8). In other words, F functional groups inhibit the HER. The potential of tuning the functionalization is key if we want full control of the chemical properties of MXenes for different applications such as chemical transformations, batteries, capacitors, etc.\n23 Chemistry and Catalysis of MXenes 453"

      "text" : "The understanding of many chemistries and catalysis of MXenes is still in its infancy and will inevitably be part of future research. As has been outlined above, the chemistry of the MXenes is highly sensitive to the functional groups on the basal planes. However, the exact relationships between the functionalization and the chemical properties are mostly unknown and might be highly dependent on the specific chemical reaction of interest. The focus of the experimental efforts will certainly include how to synthesize new MXene materials: not only carbides, but carbonitrides and espeically nitrides, as well as how to control the type and quantity of certain desired functional groups. For example, a recent study developed a technique to synthesize Ti2N from etching in KF and HCl and sonicating in DMSO [58], while others have converted carbides to carbonitrides and nitrides through the use of ammoniation [59]. Computationally, one can help build a chemistry map and stability map of MXenes with respect to their chemical formula, including the trends with respect to the nonmetal and metal constituents and functional groups, as well as their geometry, including basal planes and under-coordinates sites and defects. Even in the computational efforts, the key challenge is to establish the state of the MXene under relevant operating chemical conditions. In addition, computational efforts can help explore and potentially control the chemistry of MXenes using external means using, for example, an applied potential, pH, temperature, pressure, mechanical strain effects, and supports, to name a few. The future of MXenes looks promising, as they are being considered as active materials in a plethora of thermal catalytic reactions and electrochemical reaction, as well as being considered as support materials investigated for sensors and in photoelectrochemical reactions.\n454 L.

      "text" : "Sensors are becoming ever more important in everyday life as the connectivity of our society continues to grow larger. Entering a new era of the information age, computing devices are now all interconnected with each other to relay various types of information in large amounts, which is termed the “Internet of Things (IoT).” One of the reasons that this has become possible is the autonomous collection of data by devices and machines, in which they obtain such data through sensors. If the central processing unit is the brain of a device, sensors can be considered as the eyes, nose, ears, and the fingers of a device. Currently, numerous types of sensors are being used in electrical devices. For example, the following are a few examples of sensors embedded into a typical smartphone: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer (compass), Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor, barometer, proximity sensor, and light sensor. Different types of sensors used in other electrical sensors include color sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, gas sensors, touch (tactile) sensors, IR sensors, flow sensors, and smoke sensors.\nThe performance of sensors continues to grow according to the development of new materials with enhanced properties where high-performance sensors are highly required for future devices. Nanomaterials have always been at the frontier of such development, rapidly opening up new possibilities in various types of sensors\nS. J.

      "heading" : "Uses of Gas Sensors",
      "text" : "Gas sensors are being used in a wide range of applications, playing an important role in the industry and society. To begin with, gas sensors can be found in a household. One of the easiest places to see gas sensors is in a household hygrometer where the indoor humidity is displayed on a screen. Gas sensors in households can also be seen in air purifiers, which show the indoor concentration of volatile gases that can be toxic at high concentrations. Sensors for gas leak detection, especially for detecting hydrocarbon gases in the kitchen/gas pipes, can be very important in preventing fires and explosions. Detecting toxic gas leaks is even more important in working environments such as laboratories or factories as there are much more chemicals present and a much higher probability to be exposed to toxic gases during operation. In an even larger scale, sensors are widely used for environmental monitoring to reduce air pollutants emitted from automobiles and factories. Typically monitored gases are acidic gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). Real-time concentration of such gases can be sometimes observed in display boards at downtown crossroads. Aside from these gases, collected data of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) concentration in the atmosphere is used to monitor the global environment.\nHighly precise gas sensors are also used in the medical sector. These sensors are targeted to detect specific biomarkers, similar to the olfactory system of humans and sensitive animals that are able to detect gases at very low concentrations. The detection of volatile organic compounds such as acetone, toluene, and hexane allows the early diagnosis of various diseases from bacterial infection to cancer. Since the concentration of such biomarkers between a normal person and an ill person only differs by ppb levels, very high sensitivity is required for these types of sensors.\nPrecise gas detection is also required in the defense sector, as warfare toxins such as nerve agents, blood agents, and pulmonary agents are lethal at very small concentrations. As these gases are highly dangerous upon a short time of exposure, sensors that are able to remotely detect gases from a long distance (e.g., optical sensors) are favored in this field (Fig. 24.1).\n24 MXenes for Sensors 459"

      "heading" : "Requirements for High-Performance Gas Sensors",
      "text" : "Requirements for the practical use of gas sensors can be largely classified into performance requirements and practical requirements. A sensor’s performance requirements can be summarized into what is called “4S”: sensitivity, selectivity, speed, and stability. First, the sensitivity of a gas sensor is one of the most important performance criteria as the critical gas concentrations is very low in various situations. For example, 50 ppm of CO is the short-term exposure limit while the limit concentration is even lower for NO2 (5 ppm), SO2 (5 ppm), and H2S (10 ppm) [1]. Moreover, the required detecting concentration is extremely low for diagnostic applications. For example, ammonia can be used as a biomarker to distinguish patients infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) through a concentration difference in exhaled breath compared to a healthy person [2]. As 50–2000 ppb of ammonia is usually present in a healthy person, a gas sensor should be able to detect at least 50 ppb to distinguish patients [3]. In actual gas sensing measurements, the sensitivity of a sensing channel can be represented by the signal-to-noise ratio where the gas concentration corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 is regarded as the limit of detection [4]. Second, the selectivity of a gas sensor is as nearly equally important compared to sensitivity. Detecting only the target gas itself is highly important in practical applications, as poor selectivity can lead to misleading conclusions. However, it is highly difficult to synthesize channel materials that are able to detect only a single target molecule, as the chemical and physical properties of a gas molecules typically overlaps with another molecule to some degree, rather than being entirely independent. Therefore, most sensing systems utilize sensing arrays where the gas response of slightly modified sensing channels with similar structures are analyzed via pattern recognition. Third, fast response speed and fast recovery rate is another requirement for gas sensors. As gas response analysis can be reliably performed at saturated response values, a fast response speed toward early saturation is important to quickly obtain results. Also, fast response speeds are especially important in the case of gas leaks, where a small amount of delayed response can result in a critical situation for the exposed person. Fast recovery back to the baseline is also important as a constant baseline guarantees the same gas response over several sensing cycles. Finally, the stability of a gas sensing channel\n460 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\nis important as it determines the sensor’s lifetime. Degradation of the gas sensing channel over time may result in the change of the baseline conductivity or the change in gas response to target molecules, leading to unreliable results. Although it is nearly impossible to develop sensing channels that are permanently stable, a higher stability will definitely enhance the accessibility of a gas sensor.\nAside from performance requirements, a few practical requirements may also be taken into consideration such as energy consumption and material cost. Energy consumption is especially more important for portable/wearable devices that operate on batteries. For efficient energy use, sensors that require minimum current and those operating at room temperature are favored. Depending on the specific device application of gas sensors, development may be focused on specific factors compared to other factors listed above (Table 24.1)."

      "heading" : "Types of Gas Sensors",
      "text" : "Types of gas sensors can be classified by the mechanism in which they detect gas molecules. The most widely used type is electrical sensors (resistive sensors) where the adsorption of gas molecules on the channel surface induces a change in electrical conductivity. Electrical sensors are highly favored among various types of gas sensors due to compatibility with conventional device processing techniques. Their structure (active channel layer, source/drain/gate electrodes) can be entirely designed by lithographic techniques, and can be placed on substrates typically used in the industry. Also, as circuits can be designed at a nanometer-scale thickness, sensors can be miniaturized to fit small areas. Moreover, the very wide range of materials applicable to electrical sensors give a lot of room for development. Another widely used method is the colorimetric method where the color of a sensing channel changes upon gas reaction. Since no other components expect the gas inlet/out and active channel are required, colorimetric sensors can be made into small, hand-held sizes. Arrayed colorimetric sensors are typically used to recognize specific gases using pattern recognition. Gas chromatography methods are also used as gas sensors, sometimes coupled with sensors such as photoionization detectors\n24 MXenes for Sensors 461\n(PIDs). Chromatography methods show excellent selectivity and sensitivity, but they are highly expensive. Also, they require large spaces to operate, limiting their practicality. Other types of gas sensors include optical sensors, calorimetric sensors, and mass sensors (e.g., quartz crystal microbalances). The major advantages and disadvantages of various gas sensor types are shown in Table 24.2. In this chapter, we will focus on electrical sensors such as chemiresistors."

      "heading" : "Metal Oxide Semiconductors",
      "text" : "One of the earliest materials to be used as gas sensing channels in traditional gas sensors were metal oxide semiconductors. Many types of metal oxide semiconductors, such as SnO2, WO3, In2O3, TeO2, CuO, ZnO, and V2O5, have been reported to possess gas sensing abilities for various types of gases [5]. Among various channel materials, metal oxides have been widely utilized due to good chemical, thermal stability, low cost, and very high sensitivity.\nThe gas sensing mechanism of metal oxide sensors is through the change of electrical conductivity induced by the charge depletion layer near the surface [6]. At high temperatures, oxygen molecules in the surrounding air environment adsorb onto metal oxide particles and then ionize into molecular species (O2−) or atomic species (O−, O2−). During ionization, oxygen molecules pull electrons from metal oxide channels, resulting in a charge depletion layer near the surface. As these depletion layers create a conduction barrier, the expansion or contraction of the\n462 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\ndepletion layer will result in a change in electrical conductivity. Depending on the reducing or oxidizing property of adsorbing gases, and the p-type or n-type majority carrier of the sensing channel, gases will either pull even more electrons from the channel, or push electrons back in upon adsorption. Therefore, gas responses will occur in opposite directions according to the shifting behavior of the charge depletion layer.\nThe size of individual metal oxide nanoparticles plays a major role in determining the gas sensing performance [7], as shown in Fig. 24.2. When the size of metal oxide nanoparticles becomes very small, close to the double thickness of the charge depletion layer, charge depletion occurs in most of the bulk particle volume to greatly enhance sensitivity. In this manner, numerous efforts were devoted to enhance the performance of metal oxide gas sensors by manipulating their morphology into structures such as nanoparticles and nanowires. Optimized metal oxide gas sensors show very high sensitivity, easily detecting various gases in the ppb level. Also, the response speed and recovery rate are very fast due to high temperatures.\nFor the optimal performance of metal oxide semiconductor sensors, high operating temperatures typically above 200 ◦C are necessary. Due to the high operating temperature, a few drawbacks exist. Continued operation at high temperatures induce the growth of metal oxide grains, potentially degrading the sensing performance due to decreased percentage of the depletion layer. Also, high temperatures may be dangerous when detecting potentially explosive gases. Finally, high temperature operation requires large power consumption, which is a critical disadvantage for the growing field of portable devices. Reports have also shown that metal oxide gas sensors and their composites can operate at room temperature to evade the\n24 MXenes for Sensors 463\nproblems above; however, the sensitivity is greatly decreased, showing a limit of detection at ppm concentrations [8]."

      "text" : "Only a few metals are known to have sensing properties in their pristine. Pt and Pd nanoparticles show a gas response to hydrogen gas (H2) based on a catalytic mechanism. Upon exposure to H2, hydrides (PtH2, PdH2) are formed on the metal nanochannels to induce a change in electrical conductivity. Reports have shown that the electrical conductivity changes by a larger amount for a thinner metal channel, leading to higher sensitivity [9]. Besides H2 detection, Ag nanostructures are known to selectively detect NH3 gases. However, as there is very little variability in the type of metals and also in the type of gases that are detectable, pristine metals have very limited uses as a gas sensing channel. Metal nanoparticles coupled with organic ligands were also utilized as sensing channels to detect VOC gases. Kahn et al. demonstrated sensors based on Au nanoparticles attached with various types of thiol-based ligands forming an interconnected Au nanoparticle matrix [10]. Pristine Au nanoparticles do not typically show sensing responses, while ligand-attached nanoparticles showed different gas response behavior upon bending, depending on the type of the attached ligand."

CNT sensors are able to detect dilute gases at room temperature, which is an advantage over high-temperature operating materials such as metal oxide semiconductors. However, as the electrical properties of CNTs differ greatly depending on the metallic/semiconducting property of each nanotube, it is rather difficult to reproduce similar electrical performance. Also, the functionalization of surfaces to some degree is necessary to activate the surface for gas detection.\nAnother type of 1D nanostructures widely used is Si nanowires. Silicon in its bulk form (film type) has barely any response to gases, but their nanowires in about few tens of nm in diameter have shown good sensitivity toward various gases [11]."

      "text" : "Recently, 2D materials have shown great promise as gas sensing channels to overcome challenges faced with previously utilized materials. The surface-tovolume ratio of 2D materials is the largest among nanomaterials, due to the atomic scale thickness, which may lead to high sensitivity in gas sensors. One of the greatest merits of 2D material gas sensors is their ability to efficiently operate at room\n464 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\ntemperature. Also, as 2D films can be assembled into lithographically patternable thin films, they are one of the most optimal materials to be employed in micro-scale portable devices.\nThe operating mechanism of 2D sensors is based on a charge transfer process, originating from the adsorption of various gas molecules on the surface [12]. The gas response of a 2D sensor therefore relies on the amount and direction of charge transfer. The intensity of charge transfer typically shows a similar correlation with the binding energy of molecules to the channel; a larger amount of charge transfer for a stronger binding. Although not universal, polar molecules with specific functional groups tend to chemisorb on surfaces toward a strong binding, while nonpolar molecules tend to physisorb on surfaces toward a weak binding [13]. With regard to the direction of charge transfer, electrons can either move from the molecule to the channel (reducing molecule) or vice versa (oxidizing molecule) upon gas adsorption. Therefore, the electrical conductivity may increase or decrease depending on the gas molecule and the major carrier type of each 2D channel.\nGas adsorption properties can be controlled by altering the chemical properties of 2D materials, which can be easily manipulated by surface engineering or chemical doping. The active binding sites can be changed by attaching ligands to the surface, which can change the gas selectivity. Also, channels can be either p-doped or ndoped using electrical or molecular doping to change the gas response behavior. Such tunability leaves much room for the selective detection of target gases with 2D channel materials when optimally utilized.\nSimilar to metal oxide semiconductors, semiconducting/semimetal 2D materials such as MoS2, black phosphorus (BP), and graphene have so far been utilized as gas sensing channels. However, a trade-off between gas response signal and electrical noise has always existed in 2D gas sensing channels, as shown in Fig. 24.3. Semiconducting channels with a relative high bandgap, such as MoS2 or BP, tend to show a larger change in electrical resistivity (equal to gas response) due to high surface reactivity. For example, the electrical resistivity of semiconducting 2D channels can change over 20% upon adsorption of 100 ppm ethanol. However, the electrical noise of such channels is also high due to their relatively high electrical resistivity. As a result, there are limitations in achieving high signal-to-noise ratio. On the other hand, channels with a very small bandgap, such as graphene, show low electrical noise due to high electrical conductivity [14]. However, they show a rather small change in electrical resistivity as there are not many reactive/adsorption sites on the surface, also resulting in a limited signal-to-noise ratio. The introduction of adsorption sites, such as functional groups or defects, can enhance the gas response of graphene, however at the cost of degraded electrical conductivity due to the atomically thin nature of 2D materials. Due to these issues, conventional 2D material channel sensors have focused on optimizing the trade-off relation rather than overcoming it.\n24 MXenes for Sensors 465"

Also, the conductivity of MXenes can reach as high as 6500 S/cm, in the case of Ti3C2, which can lead to a very low electrical noise. Both of these features may lead to an ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature toward unprecedented sensitivity.\nMoreover, another large advantage is that there are currently about 20 types of MXenes experimentally realized, even more to be synthesized [15].

      "text" : "As previously mentioned, the operating mechanism of gas sensors based on twodimensional channel materials is the physical/chemical adsorption of gases on the surface. In this operation, the strength of adsorption plays a major role in the gas response behavior of two-dimensional channel materials. Thus, the adsorption mechanism is relatively simple compared to other materials such as metal oxide semiconductors and porous structures, allowing a rather easy estimation by simulations. Among various simulations, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been widely used to calculate the adsorption between target gases and 2D channel materials in a local area. The binding energies are typically calculated by the following equation:\nEbinding = Egas adsorbed channel − ( Echannel + Egas )\nMolecular binding energies calculated by DFT are typically correlated to the adsorption strength where a stronger binding energy was related to a higher gas response. Additionally, charge transfer values can be calculated to support simulated results.\n24 MXenes for Sensors 467\nYu et al. first investigated the potential of MXenes to be employed as gas sensing channels by DFT calculations [16]. In their study, monolayer Ti2CO2 was mainly investigated, while the adsorption energies of other surface functionalities (Ti2C(OH)2) and other MXenes (Ti3C2O2, V2CO2) were also studied as well. Here, the adsorption energy and charge transfer calculations of various gases such as H2, CO2, O2, NH3, CO, and CH4 to Ti2CO2 were performed using DFT. The strongest adsorption was observed for NH3 on Ti2CO2 where the density of states of the solid channel and those of the gas molecules strongly overlapped. The calculated binding energy and charge transfer of NH3 to Ti2CO2 was −0.37 eV and 0.174 e, respectively, while the binding energy of all other studied gases did not exceed −0.01 eV. These results indicate that Ti2CO2 may have a very high selectivity detecting NH3 gases.\nTo demonstrate the outstanding potential of MXene gas sensors over previous channel materials, the performance of MoS2 and phosphorene as NH3 sensors were also compared. Both 2D materials are known to have a rather high binding energy to gases due to their abundant active sites and high surface reactivity. Similarly, the adsorption energy and charge transfer from NH3 to the 2D channel material was calculated. The adsorption energy of NH3 on MoS2 and phosphorene were −0.16 and −0.21 eV, respectively, which are both lower than that on Ti2CO2, showing the superior binding energy of MXenes.\nXiao et al. further investigated in detail the adsorption of NH3 on various oxygenterminated MXenes such as Zr2CO2, Sc2CO2, and Hf2CO2 under various conditions [17]. Moreover, they studied the possibility of not only the strong adsorption of gases, but also fast recovery. Achieving fast recovery is highly important for practical gas sensors, since retaining a constant baseline is critical in obtaining reproducible results over multiple detection cycles. In this manner, the adsorption behavior of gases onto two-dimensional channel materials is a two-sided coin: the strong adsorption can give a high gas response toward high sensitivity, but the relatively difficult desorption can result in a long recovery time or a higher release temperature.\nThis study showed that external charge injection can solve the issue of poor desorption and long recovery time originating from strong adsorption on MXenes. The adsorption of NH3 to a pristine Zr2CO2 surface was calculated to be −0.81 eV, which is a relatively high value, typically corresponding to chemisorption. On the other hand, the injection of charge (e−) to the outermost Zr atoms increased the adsorption energy of NH3 to be −0.20 eV, indicating a shift from chemical adsorption to physical adsorption. Such a shift to physical adsorption allows much faster desorption compared to chemisorption. Therefore, it is suggested that both a strong adsorption and fast desorption can be achieved upon charge injection, toward a highly reversible NH3 gas sensor.\nAdditional to the adsorption of ammonia gases, Kim et al. further investigated the adsorption of a representative VOC gas (ethanol) onto Ti3C2 MXene and also studied the influence of surface functional groups on their binding strength, as shown in Fig. 24.4 [18]. Results indicate that acetone adsorbed onto hydroxylterminated Ti3C2 (Ti3C2(OH)2) showed the highest binding energy, about −0.77 eV.\n468 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\nThis value was more than twice higher than the binding energy of acetone onto other 2D channel materials such as graphene, MoS2, and BP. On the other hand, the binding energy onto oxygen-terminated (Ti3C2O2) and fluorine-terminated (Ti3C2F2) was similar to other 2D materials such as graphene, MoS2, and BP. This implies that the high coverage of –OH surface functionalities may be crucial in achieving a high gas response toward VOC gases such as acetone.\nIt is relatively easier to study the properties of MXenes through theoretical methods than by experimental methods, as the molecular structure can be precisely controlled in computations. This is shown by the fact that out of over 50 MXenes reported so far, only about 20 types have been experimentally synthesized, while over 40 types have been studied by theoretical methods [15]. By using tools such as DFT, the gas adsorption or sensing properties of other MXenes will be continued to be predicted, paving the way for MXene sensors with ground-breaking performances."

      "heading" : "Experimental Studies on MXene Gas Sensors",
      "text" : "Compared to MXene models employed in theoretical studies, the situation for an actual MXene film is largely different in actually synthesized MXene gas sensors. First, surface terminations in synthesized MXenes are typically a mixture of –O, – OH, and –F functional groups, while metal atom exposed defect sites are also present. There are no techniques currently available to precisely control the spatial arrangement and composition of each surface functional group mentioned above. In simulations, the majority of MXene molecular simulations only consider one type of surface terminations at a time. Second, practical MXene films are typically synthesized as multilayered structures, rather than being monolayer flakes as in theoretical studies. Unlike monolayer flakes, the diffusion of gases through the interlayer spacing of stacked flakes may influence the gas sensing performance. Also, the presence of internal water layers between stacked MXene flakes may play a role in determining the selectivity of gas sensors.\n24 MXenes for Sensors 469\nKim et al. conducted a thorough experimental investigation on Ti3C2Tx gas sensors [18], fully exploiting the unique combination of high electrical conductivity and abundant surface functionalities in MXenes. As previously mentioned, using a material with the highest intrinsic electrical conductivity would have the chance to yield the lowest noise. Therefore, Ti3C2Tx is one of the best choices in this manner as Ti3C2Tx shows a very high, metallic conductivity. It is also noteworthy that this is the first report on a pristine metallic channel for universal VOC gas detection.\nIn this study, Ti3C2Tx was prepared by LiF-HCl etching of Ti3AlC2 MAX phases, which were then delaminated into single flakes by sonication. The types of surface functionalities were investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, in which they showed that oxygen and hydroxyl groups are abundantly present, similar to previous reports on MXene surface functionalities. Elemental analysis via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was additionally utilized to show that abundant surface groups were present on the surface. To obtain the lowest electrical noise as possible, it is very important to synthesize MXene films with high electrical conductivity. For this, Kim et al. synthesized Ti3C2Tx films by vacuum filtration, which allows the thickness-controlled fabrication of highly uniform films down to 10 nm scale. Thin Ti3C2Tx films of 70 nm thickness fabricated by vacuum filtration showed a low electrical resistivity, below 100 ohm, due to their intrinsic metallic conductivity. Also, films were subjected to postheating treatments in vacuum to remove residual water layers on the Ti3C2Tx films, which is also highly important in achieving low electrical resistivity. On the other hand, Lee et al. demonstrated Ti3C2Tx gas sensors synthesized by drop casting, which showed a much higher electrical resistivity around 10,000 ohm [19], which is a considerably high value regarding the fact that the typical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx films is usually about 4000–8000 S/cm. This is due to the fact that it is relatively difficult to achieve film uniformity in drop-casted films. Moreover, heat-drying methods were not employed in their study, also leading to a higher electrical resistivity.\nThe Ti3C2Tx films were then immersed in a sodium hydroxide solution to dissolve the sacrificial filter and promote the formation of –OH functional groups on the surface of individual flakes prior to the transfer onto sensing electrodes. The gas sensing performance of Ti3C2Tx sensors were evaluated for various VOCs such as acetone (ketone), ethanol (alcohol), propanal (aldehyde), and ammonia (amine) and acidic gases such as NO2, CO2, and SO2. Here, the gas response was calculated by relative change of resistance from the baseline, as shown in the equation below, which is a calculation method typically employed for chemiresistors based on 2D materials.\nGas response (%) = Rgas − Rbaseline Rbaseline × 100%\nA positive response indicates an increase in the resistance and a negative response indicates a decrease in the resistance. In conventional semiconducting channels, the gas response behavior of VOC gases and acidic gases typically occur in opposite directions (positive/negative) [20, 21]. This is because the electron\n470 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\ndonating/accepting behavior is the opposite for the two groups. However, Ti3C2Tx sensors displayed an interesting behavior where the gas response for all species showed a positive response, which has been never observed. Such a phenomenon can be attributed to the metallic conductivity of Ti3C2Tx [22]. In a metallic channel, all types of adsorbed species act as scattering sites to degrade the electron transport property [23].\nFor an exposure to 100 ppm of each gas species, Ti3C2Tx films showed a much higher response to VOC gases compared to that of acidic gases, which is in accord to simulation results. The absolute gas response value itself was low, as the highest gas response (ethanol) was only 1.8%. The low gas response value is commonly observed in sensing channels with high electrical conductivity, whereas semiconducting channels such as MoS2 tend to show values around 20–40%. The high selectivity toward polar VOC gases may be also due to the gas molecules intercalating into the MXene interlayers. It is well known that polar molecules, especially amine-type molecules, readily intercalate due to the interlayer water layers, eventually expanding the interlayer distance by a considerable amount. This expansion of interlayer distance may lead to increased electrical resistivity, which can also partially explain the universal positive response. On the other hand, the intercalation of acidic gases is difficult compared to polar species.\nImportantly, Ti3C2Tx sensors were also able to show very clear and significant gas responses in the ppb concentration regime at room temperature, one of the most important requisites for therapeutic diagnosis. As shown in Fig. 24.5, clear gas responses of VOCs were easily observed at room temperature even for very low gas concentrations of 50 ppb. Ti3C2Tx gas sensors are the first of room-temperature 2D sensors that are able to detect VOCs below 100 ppb concentration, as shown in Fig. 24.6. Although the detection of VOC gases below 100 ppb has been widely\nachieved for gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors, all of these results were obtained at high operating temperature above 200 ◦C. The limit of detection for a gas sensor is widely accepted as the concentration point at which the signalto-noise ratio reaches 3 [4]. In certain setups where this point is difficult to be experimentally reached due to limits in synthesizing highly diluted gas mixtures, the limit of detection can be mathematically estimated based on a trend line (linear or power-law depending on the system). Based on this, the limit of detection for acetone and ammonia was calculated to be 0.011 and 0.13 ppb, respectively, which is one of the lowest values ever reported, also comparable to the best performing room temperature sensors such as Au nanoparticles or Si nanowires. This also indicates that Ti3C2Tx sensors will be able to detect VOC gases in the entire ppb\n472 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\nrange in ideal sensing platforms, demonstrating their potential to be utilized in therapeutic applications.\nTi3C2Tx MXene was also shown to greatly outperform other 2D materials in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. On a two-electrode sensing electrode, Ti3C2Tx displayed a very low noise of around 0.005%, lower than that of reduced graphene oxide, known to be one of the most conducting channels, which displayed an electrical noise of around 0.02%. In low-frequency noise measurements, the noise of Ti3C2Tx was even 10 times lower than that of reduced graphene oxide and 10,000 times lower than that of semiconducting MoS2 channels. Due to this low noise, the signal-to-noise ratio of Ti3C2Tx upon exposure to 100 ppm VOC gases was as high as 351 (ethanol) whereas the maximum was only about 11 for other 2D materials. Also, the signal-to-noise ratio still showed a relatively high value at very dilute gas concentrations (25.6 for 50 ppb of acetone). These results clearly show that the sensitivity of MXene greatly surpasses its counterparts, attributed to its unique combination of abundant surface functional groups and high electrical conductivity."

However, there are several important issues to overcome for the efficient utilization of MXenes for gas sensors. Although MXene gas sensors have shown a high selectivity for VOC gases over traditionally responsive acidic gases, the selectivity between individual VOC gases has not been achieved. Therefore, arrays of several surface-modified MXenes need to be utilized in order to achieve high resolution selectivity. In this manner, two factors need to be taken into consideration. First, surfaces of channel materials should be able to be easily modified by physical/chemical treatments as surface property plays a major role in determining the selectivity of 2D channel materials. Fortunately, the very high coverage of surface functionalities on MXenes leaves much room for the modification of terminal groups. Under appropriate chemical reactions, ligands can be attached to these functional groups via crosslinking, etc. By this method, MXene films with different terminal groups can be synthesized. Second, the gas sensing performance of other MXenes besides Ti3C2 needs to be further investigated.\nA large obstacle that needs to be overcome for practical application is the stability of MXene gas sensors. Achieving a constant device performance over elongated periods of time is crucial in determining the cost and efficiency of a gas sensor. MXene is known to be prone to oxidation when air or water is in the surrounding environment. Short exposures may simply result in water adsorbing to the surface, but longer exposures will oxidize MXenes to create transition metal oxide nanocrystals, which is an irreversible reaction leading to permanent degradation. In completely sealed devices such as coin cell batteries, additional water and air is blocked, so the initial device performance may be largely preserved.\n24 MXenes for Sensors 473\nHowever, regarding the operating mechanism of gas sensors, especially those dealing with breath analysis, it is hard to completely seal MXene films from oxidants as the gas adsorption sites are identical to those prone to oxidation."

First, they can be used to correct posture of people for better health. For example, sensors can also be placed on the back or on each foot to figure out the postural balance during sitting or walking. This technology can be intensively used for sport athletes. As athletes are involved in much intense body movement compared to the average person, they are prone to short-term and long-term injuries. By employing sensor-based training, an athlete can monitor their motion and weak points toward better performance. Second, sensitive sensors can used to detect signals such as heart rate and respiratory rates. One can personally monitor such health indicators over a long period of time, or give aid in monitoring realtime indicators of ill or older people that have difficulties moving around. Third, advanced tactile sensors can be used in robotic arms for remote surgery, or even in full robotic surgery in the future. In remote surgery, the motion of a human surgeon is copied onto the robotic arm that is directly acting on the patient. As the motions in a surgery need to be highly elaborate, it is critical that the robotic arm follows the motion of the human as precisely as possible. In these cases, the sensitivity and reproducible operation of sensors is of paramount importance. The most renowned application of tactile sensors nowadays is the “electronic skin,” which refers to an artificial surface able to highly mimic the mechanoreceptors of the human skin. This technology is highly important for allowing humanoid robots to follow human activities such as grabbing/holding objects, recognizing surface texture, or using writing instruments. Although these activities look simple to us, these require very high sensitivity in wide stimuli ranges and fast responses in order to implement in a robot."

      "text" : "The main requirements for a high-performance tactile sensor can be summarized into sensitivity, range, linearity and reproducibility, and speed. First, sensitivity to very small force is highly important. For example, the high sensitivity of the human finger allows us to do elaborate behavior such as using tweezers or chopsticks to pick up small items. In order for artificial machines to mimic such elaborate behavior, they need to be able to detect very small stimuli. Sensitivity of a tactile\n474 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\nsensor is typically demonstrated as the “gauge factor,” which indicates the relative response per unit stimuli. For example, in a resistive-type strain sensor, the gauge factor represents the relative change in electrical resistivity per strain. Sensors with low sensitivity may have a gauge factor below 10, while highly sensitive sensors may show gauge factors above 500. Besides force sensitivity, a high spatial resolution is necessary. In artificial devices, this is usually dependent on the size of individual receptors and the circuitry resolution of the device. The smaller the receptors and the denser the circuits are, the sensitivity will be higher. Second, the range of detection is important. Among various activities throughout a day, the applied external force can be very small in some cases, such as a bee sitting on a surface, or a finger touching a very soft object. On the other hand, the external force can be very large, such as in the case of weighing cargo or during collision. As future machines/robots many deal with numerous types of operations, sensors with a wide range of detection are highly desired. However, many conventional materials show a trade-off between sensitivity and detecting range, and fabricating sensors that have both high sensitivity and a wide detecting range is a challenge. Third, linearity and reproducibility are important for the reliable operation of a tactile sensor. Depending on the channel material and sensing system, electrical resistivity may not linearly correlate to external force. Such nonlinearity of the sensor makes calibration and reverse calculation highly difficult, leading to a lower resolution toward lower sensitivity. Moreover, extreme deformation in channels such as cracks or disconnections can break the original correlation curve to create nonlinearity in previously linear systems. This will greatly degrade the reproducibility of a sensor, limiting its use. Finally, the response speed of a sensor is important to catch small variations in external stimuli toward performing elaborate actions."

      "heading" : "Types of Tactile Sensors",
      "text" : "Tactile sensors can be classified by the specific mechanism of how the mechanical deformations are transduced into signals. Examples of sensors by this classification are resistive (piezoresistive), capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, optical, and magnetic sensors. Due to practicality, easiness of fabrication, and the capability to be utilized into flexible/wearable devices, resistive sensors and capacitive sensors are mainly used over other types.\nThese two sensors can be further classified by the behavior of nanomaterials upon mechanical strain or pressure: piezoresistive, geometrical, and percolationbased sensors. In piezoresistive sensors, change in electrical resistance is caused by the structural deformation of the material itself in the atomic/molecular scale. Piezoresistors are highly sensitive and are able to function in small working areas. Semiconducting piezoresistors tend to show a larger sensitivity over metallic piezoresistors due to the fact that the change of bandgap upon atomic deformation can greatly change electrical resistance. However, piezoresistors made of a single material/component are typically fragile, as the intrinsic stretchability of materials\n24 MXenes for Sensors 475\nare not high. In geometrical sensors, change in electrical resistance is caused by the geometry change of films or structures, due to the fact that electrical resistance is not only dependent on the material’s resistivity, but also dependent on the length and cross-sectional area of a channel. In strain gauge sensors, very high levels of strain can not only deform the original geometry, but also disconnect films by forming cracks. This may lead to dramatically enhanced sensitivity, but may also result in irreversible and nonlinear performance. As the materials’ fragility can limit its use as a strain gauge sensor, many studies have embedded them into polymeric substrates. In percolation-based sensors, the change in electrical resistance is dependent on the junction density of conducting channels. By using fiber-like materials, such as carbon nanotubes or silver nanowires, matrix-like conducting channels can be created. In such channels, electrons are conducted through inter-fiber junctions, unlike in films where electrons are conducted through the entire plane. Stretching the sensor decreases the junction density per area, leading to increased electrical resistance. Percolation-based sensors are highly stretchable compared to other types, but typically show lower sensitivity (Table 24.4)."

Sensing channels were prepared by pressing a drop of multilayered Ti3C2Tx with two polyimide tapes that function as the flexible substrate. This results in a roughly stacked Ti3C2Tx film with empty spaces of 3–12 nm thickness due to the irregular morphology of individual flakes. Due to such morphology, piezoresistivity occurred due to two major reasons.\nIn the first phase, initial pressure on the multilayer Ti3C2Tx film compresses the film in an out-of-plane direction, which gradually removes the originally present empty inter-flake spaces. This results in more Ti3C2Tx flakes being in direct contact with one another leading to a decreased electrical resistivity. Continually applying\n476 S. J. Kim and H.-T. Jung\npressure in this stage will eventually reach a point when empty spaces are no longer present in the film, ending the first phase. In the second phase, higher pressure compresses the Ti3C2Tx film at a molecular scale. The interlayer distance of MXenes are typically larger compared to that of other layer-stacked materials, which is due to the presence of a water layer. These water layers are not in the bulk phase, and they are removable or compressible to some amount. Applying pressure decreases interlayer distance, which brings each Ti3C2Tx unit layer closer to each other, resulting in a decreased electrical resistivity.\nAs the conductivity change can be expected to be much larger in the first phase compared to the second phase, we can expect a higher sensitivity in a low strain regime. This is shown in actual results where demonstrated Ti3C2Tx tactile sensors show a high gauge factor of 94.8–180.1 for low strains below 1.0%, while the gauge factor was lower at 45.9–94.8 for strain values larger than 1.0%. The piezoresistive sensor was able to detect various human motions: eye blinking, cheek bulging, throat swallowing, and bending-release movement of the elbow, finger, ankle, and knee. Each motion resulted in an increase in electrical current due to the vertical contraction of MXene layers, demonstrating the practical use of MXene piezoresistive tactile sensors (Fig. 24.7).\n24 MXenes for Sensors 477"

Cai et al. repeatedly spray-coated MXene and CNT solutions by layer-by-layer assembly to form sandwich-like MXene-CNT layers on elastic substrates [25]. The fiber-like CNTs knitted the Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets to give elasticity in the composite film itself.\nThe sensing mechanism of the MXene-CNT composite mainly arose from the cracking of MXene flakes from external strain. Upon a small amount of strain, cracks begin to form in the MXene sheets connected by fibrous CNT, resulting in an increased electrical resistivity. Unless the film does not disconnect entirely, the cracking behavior may be reversible to yield stable performance over numerous cycles. Upon a very large strain, cracks can severely propagate to create islands that are completely disconnected from each other. This results in a dramatic change in electrical conductivity. However, the complete disconnection may not allow full reversibility to the film’s original morphology, resulting in an altered sensing performance.\nFollowing the sensing mechanism of MXene-CNT strain gauge sensors, results show that the gauge factor dramatically increased as the strain intensity became larger. For a very small strain up to 0.6%, the gauge factor was only 4.35 while for a larger strain up to 30%, the gauge factor increased to about 64.60. In these strain regimes, identical sensitivity was demonstrated for up to 1000 cycles indicating the reversible operation of tactile sensors. Therefore, we can expect that the film does not fully disconnect at a strain of 30%. At strain values higher than 40%, the gauge factor rapidly increased to a value of 772.60 that can be expected to be due to the complete cracking of MXene-CNT films. The limited reversibility was also shown in the strain response at different cycles where the change in electrical resistivity became smaller for identical strains in latter stretching cycles. Compared to the piezoresistive case, the MXene composite strain sensor were demonstrated up to much larger strain values with greater gauge factors. The strain sensor was able to detect verbal patterns, responding to each syllable of a word, and human motions such as walking, running, and jumping. Each motion resulted in a decrease in electrical current due to disconnected junctions, showing opposite behavior to the previously introduced MXene piezoresistive sensors."

As MXenes have a very unique property among nanomaterials, and also due to the fact that there are over 50 types of possible MXenes, it is expected that MXene sensors will continue to show groundbreaking results in the near future. A major challenge to consider in the future direction of MXene sensors lies in the tunability of MXene morphology and its surface functionalities. So far, MXenes are synthesized by a top-down etching method in aqueous solutions. Therefore, their flake size and surface functionalities are in a large part predetermined by the etching environment. If further techniques to control such factors are developed, such as bottom-up chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis or post-synthesis surface treatments, we can expect that large opportunities in tunable sensing applications will emerge."

      "text" : "Future personal electronics will be the shift toward optically transparent, touchable, flexible devices [1, 2]. Central to these devices is the development of transparent, conductive ultrathin films, also termed as transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs). Developing high-performance TCEs is crucial in many applications such as touch screens, displays, solar cells, and others [3]. Importantly, incorporating TCEs into energy storage devices, such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors, is a crucial technology for the next-generation portable, wearable electronics. Transparent energy storage systems will require the material of choice that can simultaneously act as current collectors to transport electrons and active material to store charge. This is quite challenging as dramatically increased sheet resistance is typically experienced when approaching high transparency of the TCEs. Consequently, the device charge storage properties become unsatisfactory.\nCurrently, the TCEs market is dominated by indium tin oxide (ITO). Although ITO possesses excellent optoelectronic properties, it showcases brittleness and needs high-temperature treatment during thin-film processing, adding high cost to manufacturing. This means that for future transparent energy storage devices, ITO is unlikely to be the material of choice. Instead, advanced alternative ultrathin films\nC. J.

Nicolosi\nneed to be developed with good mechanical properties and excellent charge storage performance in order to enable the production of flexible, robust TCEs and their transparent energy storage devices.\nRecently, a large class of two-dimensional (2D) metal carbide and nitrides, known as MXenes, have emerged. Selectively etching the A layer (typically Al or Ga) from the MAX phase (where M represents an early transition metal, X is C and/or N) in the hydrofluoric acid (HF)-containing solution, MXenes are obtained with a general formula of Mn+1XnTx (Tx stands for various surface functionalities such as –OH, –O, and/or –F, and n = 1, 2, or 3) [4–6]. Upon solvent intercalation and/or cation exchange followed by sonication or mechanical vibration, the multilayered (m-) MXene powders were delaminated into MXene nanosheets with lateral size typically less than one micrometers (μm). It is noteworthy that once the delamination is performed in water, an aqueous colloidal solution of single- and few-layer MXenes is obtained. This enables a facile and environmentally friendly processing of the MXene solution into any items, such as composites, coatings, and devices. Despite the presence of terminal surface groups, MXenes, especially the most intensively studied titanium carbide MXene, showcase a metallic conductivity [7–9]. The excellent electronic conductivity coupled with fast faradaic reactions results in impressive charge storage property, so-called pseudocapacitance [10], in the MXenes. In addition, monolayer MXene nanosheet is optically transparent, similar to the analogue graphene. Collectively, MXenes are quite promising for the high-performance transparent conductive coatings and transparent energy storage systems.\nThis chapter describes the electrode materials used for the transparent conductive films and transparent supercapacitors. Specifically, we highlight the fabrication of MXene transparent films and devices. Fundamentals and limitations of TCEs are also included. Considering that the number of publications on the TCEs grows enormously, this chapter is not attempting to include all the TCEs exhaustively; rather, it shows the important examples using MXenes to shed light on the main trends."

      "text" : "Transparent conductive films play a significant role in modern consumer electronics such as liquid crystal displays, flat panel displays, organic light-emitting diode (OLED), plasma displays, touch panels, video and still-image recorders, solar cells, lasers, and optical communication devices, [11] as shown in Fig. 25.1. Developing high-performance TCEs is the key to boost next-generation portable electronics.\nIdeally, the TCE should possess both high transmittance across the UV-vis-NIR spectrum and low sheet resistance (Rs). In practical, we measure the transmittance spectrum of the TCE in a range of 350–800 nm (UV-vis wavelength range) and define the absorbance at 550 nm as the transmittance (T). The sheet resistance can be obtained by a four-point (or two-point) probe. Decreasing the film thickness will improve T but also inevitably increases Rs. For example, when carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used to fabricate TCEs, a higher CNTs density results in more light\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 483\nabsorption; thus the transmittance is decreased. At the same time, due to a more developed charge percolation enabled by CNTs network, the Rs decreases [3, 12]. In other words, there is a trade-off between these two parameters. To facilitate the direct comparison among TCEs, some variations have been proposed with the most common one being the ratio of dc electrical conductivity (σ dc) to optical conductivity (σ op) [13]. Such a ratio is also defined as figure of merit (FoMe = σ dc/σ op), which can be obtained through Eq. (25.1):\nT = (\n1 + 188.5 Rs σop σdc\n)−2 (25.1)\nActually the above formula is correct provided that (1) the wavelength of the incident light is larger than the film thickness and (2) the fraction of reflected light is much less than the absorbance [11]. For most of the TCEs, these two conditions are usually met; thus Eq. (25.1) is frequently employed to estimate the optoelectronic properties of the TCEs. For a given film with a specific thickness (t), the FoMe is calculated based on the measured T and Rs. According to t and Rs, the electrical conductivity of this film can be obtained through Eq. (25.2):\nσdc = 1 Rst\n(25.2)\nApplication T (%) Rs ( /sq) σ dc/σ op (FoMe) Touch panel 85 500 4.5 LCD screen 85 100 22.3 OLED display 90 50 69.7 Photovoltaic electrode 90 10 348\nReprinted with permission from Ref. [11]. Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society\nA higher FoMe indicates better optoelectronic properties and maintains good electrical conductivity even at a high transparency (low thickness). On the other hand, TCEs with tailored optoelectronic properties can be used in different applications. For example, the touch panel requires T > 85% and Rs < 500 /sq., while liquid crystal display (LCD) screen T > 85% and Rs < 100 /sq. [11, 14–16] According to Eq. (25.1), the FoMe is calculated to be 4.5 in touch panel and 22.3 in LCD, respectively. Table 25.1 lists the minimum requirements of TCEs in different applications.\nGenerally, fabricating films with a higher FoMe is the ultimate goal in the TCE field. Although doped transition metal oxides, most commonly ITO showcases impressively high FoMe, its brittleness and high cost limit the future application in the portable electronics [17]. Therefore, questing advanced films with excellent mechanical and optoelectronic properties is the key to the next-generation touchable electronics. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, silver nanowires, and other nanomaterials possess a quite high aspect ratio, rendering their TCEs mechanically flexible with high σ dc. For CNT-based TCEs, their optoelectronic properties are influenced by many factors such as type, diameter, and bundle length of CNT, film fabrication method, etc. [11] By controlling the film thickness made of single-, double-, or multi-walled CNT, effect of the number of walls of the CNT on the sheet resistance can be thus revealed. As shown in Fig. 25.2, less number of CNT walls results in lower Rs; this is because more walls inevitably increase the diameter of the nanotubes and increase the light absorption instead of conductivity. In addition, the methods to produce TCEs are also important to control the optoelectronic properties. Using roll-to-roll process give CNT TCEs with a very high FoMe (82.7) from the aligned CNT forest [18], and opening up vast opportunities in LCD and OLED displays, while spraying the SWCNT solution onto the substrate generally results in a lower FoMe (1.9) [3]. Despite that, the wet methods, such as spray/spin/dip coating, brush painting, vacuum filtration, etc., bring immediate advantages such as high production efficiency and compatibility with industrial scale.\nActually, in the CNT-based TCEs, the thickness of the film is typically tens of nanometer. For a uniform, homogeneous TCE made of SWCNT, the thickness is usually lower than 50 nm in the high transparency region (T > 70%). Thus, the film can be viewed as two-dimensional (2D) consisted of one-dimensional (1D) CNTbased networks. The charge carriers flow along a tube and then jump to another tube at the junction. Therefore, the model can be simplified and the sheet resistance is a sum of contact resistance on the junctions due to the overlapping of nanotubes\nand the intrinsic resistance from the tube [11]. This simplified model can also be applied to graphene [14, 15, 19]. The highly conductive nature of these two kinds of sp2 carbons renders the intrinsic resistance negligible. Said otherwise, the junction resistance largely determines the optoelectronic performance in the CNT or graphene-based TCEs. According to the 2D percolation theory, the percolation threshold (Nc) can be described through Eq. (25.3):\nNc = 4.2362πLs2 ≈ 1/L (25.3)\nwhere Ls and L are the individual length and the aspect ratio of the CNT, respectively [20]. For typical SWCNTs, the L is up to ~1000 which results in a quite low percolation threshold. This means that the surface coverage to form a path and conduct the charge carriers is low, leading to a high transmittance in the CNT-based TCEs. Actually, comparing to graphene TCEs, the surface coverage in CNT ones is lower, thus TCEs fabricated using SWCNT usually showcase higher transparency and demonstrate better optoelectronic properties than the graphene ones [3, 21, 22].\nDe and Coleman compared the optoelectronic properties of graphene-based TCEs from various published papers in detail, as shown in Fig. 25.3 [23]. For the CVD-grown graphene films, a highest FoMe (11) is observed. For the TCEs fabricated using RGO or CMG or liquid phase-exfoliated graphene flakes, the FoMe is much lower (<0.7, as shown in Fig. 25.3b). This can be explained that the interflake tunneling barriers, similar to junctions in the CNT networks, are much less in the quasi-continuous CVD-grown films than the solution processed films [23]. However, by doping the graphene films through chemical treatments, the FoMe can be substantially improved. This is highlighted by Ahn et al., who produced transparent graphene films using a roll-to-roll strategy followed by wetchemical doping of monolayer CVD-grown flakes (shown in Fig. 25.4) [2]. Notably, the films showcase excellent optoelectronic properties even superior to commercial\n486 C. J. Zhang and V. Nicolosi\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 487\ntransparent ITO electrode. For example, the films demonstrate a T = 90% and a Rs = 30 /sq., indicating a FoMe as high as 116 according to Eq. (25.1).\nApart from the generally low FoMe in most CNT or graphene-based TCEs, there is another limitation. When thinning down the film thickness, the transmittance becomes higher and thus the TCE is more desirable. However, in the highly transparent region, the surface coverage is typically below Nc, which results in a dramatically increased sheet resistance. This issue is known as percolation effect, which is reflected by the deviation of bulk-like behavior in the T vs Rs and Rs vs t plot. Figure 25.5a–c shows the optoelectronic properties of P3-SWCNT TCEs [3]. As expected for bulk-like materials, for the thicker films, Rs scales inversely with film thickness, as demonstrated by the dashed line in (b). When the thickness\n488 C. J. Zhang and V. Nicolosi\ndecreases further and below a critical value, tmin, dc, the deviation evolves with dramatically increased Rs, as percolation effects become important. We note such an effect can be encountered not only in the CNT or graphene-based TCEs [24], but also found in the CNT/polymer composite [25] and silver nanowire networks [13]. Despite an extremely high FoMe (~500) achieved in the silver nanowire TCE with film thickness > 300 nm (corresponding to T < 50%), in the highly transparent region (T > 90%), FoMe dramatically reduces to 30, as shown in Fig. 25.5e–i. Recently, formic acid-treated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene-4sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was reported with an extremely low σ op (24 S/cm) coupled with high σ dc (936 S/cm), indicative of FoMe = 39. Most importantly, no percolation problems are encountered (shown in Fig. 25.6), suggesting exceptional uniformity for the highly transparent films (T = 99%) [26]."

      "text" : "As previously discussed, the technologically viable devices should operate in the bulk-like regime, where the σ dc is roughly independent of T. Said otherwise, the notorious percolation problems should be avoided as much as possible. This is quite challenging, as the percolative conductive network is usually interrupted when thinning down the transparent films. Solution to this issue lies in developing novel materials that possess excellent electronic conductivity and a high aspect ratio, the latter endows less interflake tunneling barriers or junctions coupled with good mechanical flexibility.\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 489\nTwo-dimensional transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, also known as MXenes, have emerged and quickly become attractive since 2011 [4, 6]. To date, Ti3C2Tx is the most widely studied one with applications in energy storage devices [27–30], electromagnetic-interference shielding [31–33], water desalination [34], etc. Despite the existence of these surface functionalities, Ti3C2Tx showcases a metallic electronic conductivity with measured value even higher than that of graphene, rendering a great promise of this new 2D material in the TCE field [35]."

      "text" : "Pioneer work on the Ti3C2Tx transparent films was performed by Halim et al., who sputter deposited epitaxial Ti3AlC2 films followed by selective etching of the Al element [36]. The as-obtained epitaxial thin films were about 19 nm thick, corresponding to a T = 90% in the visible-to-infrared range. Despite that, MXene films fabricated by such a method raises up cost and scale-up concerns. For potentially large-scale production of TCEs, the film fabrication method must be scalable and low cost.\nWhen multilayered Ti3C2Tx is sonicated under the inert gas, delaminated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with a predominant monolayer distribution are obtained. Unlike the analogue graphene, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets possess a hydrophilic surface and thus can be easily dispersed in water, forming aqueous dispersions. Through a solution processing strategy, Ti3C2Tx-based TCEs can be fabricated with controllable thickness and, thus, tunable optoelectronic properties. It is important to point out that the aqueous solution processing immediately brings advantages to the thin film fabrication, composite formation, and device manufacturing. Compared to the ITO production which requires high-temperature treatment, solution processing of Ti3C2Tx aqueous solution at room temperature greatly simplifies the procedure and reduces the cost. In addition, the high aspect ratio of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets renders the resultant TCE with a high mechanical flexibility, in sharp contrast to the brittleness in the ITO-based films.\nSpraying the Ti3C2Tx aqueous solution can produce transparent homogeneous films with thickness ranging from 5 to 70 nm, corresponding to 40–91% of transmittance. At T = 40% (thickness, t~70 nm), Rs = 500 /sq. Decreasing the thickness to 5 nm leads to T = 91%; as expected, however, Rs boosts to 8 k /sq. Taking this values together, FoMe in these Ti3C2Tx TCEs by spray coating is around 0.5–0.7 [37]. Despite the FoMe being far below to that of ITO, it is comparable to the analogue graphene [23, 24]. In another trial of spray coating of Ti3C2Tx, the resistivity reaches 3.4 × 104 /cm at a T = 86.7%, leading to a somewhat low FoMe [38]. We propose the undesirable FoMe in the highly conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene could be attributed to the thin film fabrication method. In the spray coating setup, the droplets are purged by the gas and sprayed onto the hot substrate, where the solvent (ethanol [37] or water [38]) gets quickly evaporated. The as-generated vapor bubbles and the nanosheets create plenty of voids/pores that negatively hinder the\n490 C. J. Zhang and V. Nicolosi\nsmooth transport of charge carriers among the randomly stacked network. Another possible reason is that, despite a high σ dc observed in Ti3C2Tx, its σ op is also quite high, leading to a relatively low FoMe.\nTo further check the abovementioned hypothesis, we compared the optoelectronic properties of Ti3C2Tx-based TCEs using spray-coating and spin-casting methods, respectively. Figure 25.7 shows basic characterizations of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and T vs Rs curves of two kinds of TCEs. The spray-coated films showcase an uneven surface with corners clearly seen, which should be a result of quick water evaporation. By adjusting the sprayed volume, a series of TCEs with different transmittance were obtained (Fig. 25.7d–e). Through fitting the T vs Rs data, we found the FoMe to be 1.7 in the spin-casted films while 0.6 in the spray-coated ones. The FoMe = 0.6 in our case falls exactly in the range of 0.5–0.7 in the first report on the MXene spray coating as discussed above [37]. The higher FoMe in the spin-casted films should be attributed to the highly ordered nanosheets forming compacted conductive network and the absence of randomly stacked sheets or voids, which will be discussed below.\nTaylor et al. prepared a range of Ti3C2Tx TCEs using the spin coating method [39]. By tuning the spin speed from 400 to 1600 rpm, TCEs with different film thickness are thus obtained. The slower the spin rate is, the greater the overlap of the nanosheets is observed. For example, decreasing the spin rate from 1000 rpm\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 491\nto 800, 600, and 400 rpm leads to a mean overlap of two, three, four, and five nanosheets on the TCEs, respectively. At 400 rpm, the TCE demonstrates a T of 77% and Rs of 437 /sq. However, at 1000 rpm, T improves to 85% at the cost of Rs, which dramatically boosts to 10 k /sq. due to the less amount of interconnected flakes [39]. In other words, the grain boundaries play a significant role in forming the continuous network. Taking these data together, the spin-cast Ti3C2Tx TCEs possess a high conductivity of 3092 S/cm and a FoMe of 3.1. Importantly, by vacuum annealing these wet films at 175 ◦C, Rs can be reduced substantially, which is a result of elimination of adsorbed water on the surface and between the nanosheets [39]. This also highlights the importance of films storage, as water gradually oxidizes the films, especially for the highly transparent ones. Using a similar method, Barsoum et al. fabricated Ti3C2Tx TCEs with an even higher conductivity, 6500 S/cm. The FoMe reaches 5 from the fitting of the bulk regime [40]. Unfortunately, percolation problems are still encountered in these spin-cast films.\nBy controlling the flake alignment using the spin coating approach, followed by vacuum annealing at 200 ◦C, we achieved various Ti3C2Tx TCEs with thickness ranging from 1.4 nm (T = 97.3%) to 189 nm (T = 12.3%) [9]. Under the effect of shear force, the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, with several micrometers in lateral size (Fig. 25.8a), aligned parallel to the substrate and interconnected into a continuous film without protruding corners of flakes (Fig. 25.8b–c).\n492 C. J. Zhang and V. Nicolosi\nAs previously discussed, percolation effects are typically found in the regime with a high transmittance. Due to the insufficient interflake tunneling barriers in the highly transparent Ti3C2Tx TCEs (T > 90%), the conductivity of the film switches from the bulk-type DC conductivity behavior in the single flakes to the percolation behavior. This is verified through the T vs Rs plot as the points fall below the dashed line (bulk-like conductivity), as seen in the spray-coated film in Fig. 25.7f.\nTo see the percolation effects clearly, Eq. (25.1) can be rearranged as\nT −0.5 − 1 = 188.5 FoMe × Rs (25.4)\nBy plotting the T−0.5–1 as a function of Rs, we can determine the bulk-like conductivity behavior regime, the percolation regime, and the FoMe based on the slope of the fitted line [25]. Figure 25.8d shows that all measured data are roughly on the fitted bulk-type DC conductivity curve. The FoMe obtained by fitting the data in Fig. 25.8d is 15, surpassing almost all the carbon-based TCEs (Fig. 25.8e). By correlating Rs with film thickness, we found that, in general, Rs scales inversely with t (Fig. 25.8f), typically seen in the bulk-like materials. In other words, no apparent percolation problems are encountered in our Ti3C2Tx TCEs. This is further verified by the almost constant FoMe values in a range of thickness (or T, Fig. 25.9c). Impressively, our Ti3C2Tx TCEs demonstrate a σ dc = 5736 S/cm at T = 93% (t = 4 nm) and increase to 9880 S/cm at the cost of transmittance (T = 29%, t = 88 nm; Fig. 25.9b). The mean σ dc obtained from fitting the sheet conductance data in Fig. 25.9a, reaches 7350 S/cm.\nIn addition, the optoelectronic properties of TCEs are also influenced by the flake size and MXene type. As mentioned in Fig. 25.7f, the smaller flakes greatly reduce the FoMe from 15 to 1.7 when the size decreases from 3.2 μm to 268 nm. When small Ti2CTx flakes (~300 nm) are employed, the corresponding TCEs exhibit a FoMe of 0.5. Despite that, all MXene TCEs demonstrate a bulk-type conductivity, as all the measured points are on the dashed line showing in the inset of Fig. 25.9e. We note this is quite significant, which allows the TCEs to be more transparent without compromising the conductivity. In other words, the technologically viable devices based on the Ti3C2Tx thin films would render the DC conductivity roughly independent of T [9]. This unique property implies that for the highly transparent TCEs, the continuous Ti3C2Tx film could act as the efficient transparent current collector to transport electrons, as well as the active material to store charge at the same time. Namely, transparent supercapacitor can be thus built based on the Ti3C2Tx TCEs without the need of extra metals as current collectors."

      "text" : "Inside the broad MXene family, there is certainly a need to investigate the optoelectronic and electrochemical properties of other MXenes and further explore their applications. Vanadium carbide (V2CTx) films were shown to have a conductivity up\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 493\nto 1560 S cm-1 [41]. The challenging lies in the delamination of the m-V2CTx into d-V2CTx. Ying et al. delaminated the V2CTx in the 10 wt% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) solution [42]. The as-obtained V2CTx TCEs display a higher FoMe (6.5) than the Ti3C2Tx counterpart [40, 42]. It’s observed that annealing temperature plays an important role in achieving a high conductivity. For instance, the σ dc in the as-obtained films is 10 S cm−1, which dramatically increases to 3300 S cm−1 after annealing, an indicative of 300-fold increase [42]. The annealing process eliminates the trapped water molecules and thus improves the conductivity as a result. By further optimizing the synthesis recipe, such as employing less destructive etchant instead of HF, larger, cleaner sheets can be expected with less defects, thus higher DC conductivity. Consequently, the FoMe in the V2CTx TCEs can be pushed further.\n494 C. J. Zhang and V. Nicolosi\nAnother example is Ti2CTx TCEs. Ying et al. prepared a concentrated Ti2CTx colloidal solution (25 mg ml−1) and thus a series of Ti2CTx TCEs. For the first time, a very high sheet conductivity has been achieved (5250 S cm−1) [43]. This is because the density of charge carriers is high [40, 44]. Benefiting from this, a high FoMe of 5 is obtained. It is reasonable to assume that the Ti2CTx TCEs have more advantages than the Ti3C2Tx counterpart, such as non-toxic, less expensive, and even better optoelectronic properties [43]. However, the stability of Ti2CTx aqueous colloidal solution as well as the TCEs should be addressed before the scalable production."

      "text" : "The fast growth of smart portable electronics requires the future products with exotic properties such as being flexible, stretchable, and transparent. To match with this trend, highly flexible and transparent power sources, most likely batteries and supercapacitors (SCs), should be developed [45]. In the past few years, significant efforts have been paid on building transparent solid-state SCs. For instances, through sandwiching the TCEs based on CNTs [46–48], graphene [49–52], metallic mesh and metal oxides [53–56], conducting polymers [57, 58], etc., with solid gel electrolyte as the separator, transparent SCs are thus developed. However, in some transparent SC reports, either complex procedures during the TCE fabrication were encountered [57, 58], or rigid substrates (such as ITO [55] or FTO [58]) were employed to provide efficient current collection, which limit the future of transparent SCs. Rather, by depositing the ultrathin films onto a robust plastic substrate in a scalable, simple strategy should be the option in building the nextgeneration transparent SCs. This requires the film as both efficient transparent current collector and high-performance transparent active material for capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) charge storage.\nFor any SC, the performance metrics are the stored energy (E) and power output (P):\nE = 1 2 CV 2 (25.5)\nP = V 2\n4RESR (25.6)\nIn the perspective of materials, the electrode capacitance (C) should be maximized while the equivalent series resistance (RESR) be minimized. For the device, the operated voltage window (V) is limited by the aqueous electrolyte (1.2 V) and can be overcome by building the asymmetric configuration [59]. Consequently, both E and P of the transparent SCs are maximized. Other properties, such as excellent rate handling, long-term cycling, and reversible charge-discharge processes, are also desired for the as-fabricated transparent SCs.\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 495\nIn practical, for a given TCE, areal capacitance (CA) and volumetric capacitance (CV) are two most relevant measures and are related via CA = CVt. Both CA and CV are independent quantities and achieved in the absence of electron or ion transport limitations [26]. Although a TCE can be engineered with an ultrahigh T by making it sufficiently thin, the percolation problems become dominant, which results in a dramatically boosted Rs and thus negatively affect power. On the other hand, high T leads to much compromised CA and hence energy [3]. To quantify these trade-offs, CA is correlated with T for a set of TCEs through the expression: [3]\nT = [\n1 + 188.5 CV σopCA\n]−2 (25.7)\nFor a given T, the ratio CV/σ op must be maximized to optimize the areal capacitance. Therefore, CV/σ op can be considered as a figure of merit (FoMc) for transparent capacitive films. Once FoMc is known, CV of the TCEs can be thus calculated by CV = FoMc × σ op. The higher this value is, the better the charge storage properties in the TCEs. Although ultrahigh FoMe values are achieved in the silver nanowire-based TCEs [13] and metallic mesh electrode [53], these metals do not possess a good charge storage capability. Alternatively, guest materials, such as conductive polymer and metal oxide, are deposited onto the highly conductive host [53, 59]. Again, this complicates the procedure in constructing high-performance transparent SCs.\nTi3C2Tx MXene is known for its ultrahigh electronic conductivity (up to 9880 S/cm) [9] and excellent electrochemical performance [7, 27], being the ideal candidate for transparent SCs. As previously stated, no percolation problems are encountered in the Ti3C2Tx TCEs which were fabricated through spin-casting the nanosheets solution followed by vacuum annealing [9]. This allows the device to be highly transparent since the metal or metallic mesh current collector is absent. In the three-electrode setup, the CV curves of T = 98% sample severely deviates from the quasi-rectangular shape, while electrodes with a lower T (such as T = 40%) well maintains the broad redox peak couple (Fig. 25.10a–c). Consequently, the measured areal capacitance as well as the rate capability is controlled by the film thickness. For instances, the T = 98% exhibits 0.13 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s, a value that is close to PEDOT:PSS film [26] but substantially higher than that of graphene quantum dot-based TCE [50]. Increasing the film thickness to 60 nm (T = 40%) results in 3.4 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s and maintains 3.0 mF/cm2 at 200 mV/s, as shown in Fig. 25.10d [9].\nTo reveal the intrinsic areal capacitance (CA) in the Ti3C2Tx electrodes, the data in Fig. 25.10d is fitted using Eq. (25.8):\nC A = CA\n[ 1 − ντ\nV\n( 1 − e− Vντ )] (25.8)\nwhere τ = RESR C is the time constant, V is the voltage window (0.65 V), and ν is the sweep rate. Although Eq. (25.8) greatly simplifies the complex electrochemical\n496 C. J. Zhang and V. Nicolosi\nbehaviors, it still provides valuable insights for the TCE [26]. In general, CA is higher for the thicker TCE as expected. By correlating the CA with T, and further fitting these two parameters using Eq. (25.7), we are able to reveal the FoMc (CV/σ op) of the Ti3C2Tx as the transparent SC electrode. As demonstrated in Fig. 25.10e, a good fit is revealed with a FoMc of 1.3 F S cm−2, lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (1.9 F S cm−2) but substantially higher than the P3-SWCNT (0.3 F S cm−2) [3, 26]. Based on the FoMc and σ op, the CV of Ti3C2Tx films as transparent SC electrode was calculated to be 676 F/cm3, much higher than that achieved in the rest of all transparent SC electrodes, such as SWCNT [3, 60], graphene [61], or PEDOT:PSS [26], as shown in Fig. 25.10f.\nIt’s important to explore the device performance based on the Ti3C2Tx TCEs. By sandwiching two robust TCEs with gel electrolyte as the separator, transparent, flexible, solid-state SCs can be easily produced [9, 59]. Using the T = 91% as the electrode, the Ti3C2Tx-based symmetric SC reaches a transmittance of 80%. The as-fabricated device showcases highly capacitive behavior, including rectangular CV shape up to 200 mV/s, rapid current response upon voltage reversal, and linear galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves. The transparent, symmetric SC demonstrates an areal capacitance of 0.86 mF/cm2, slightly higher than the ruthenium oxide/PEDOT:PSS system [59] but much higher than the rest transparent devices, as shown in Fig. 25.11c.\n25 MXenes for Transparent Conductive Electrodes and Transparent Energy. . . 497\nBy pairing two electrodes with different potential ranges and building asymmetric, transparent SC, the voltage window of the device can be further broadened, thus enhancing the energy density of the device. Figure 25.12a shows the CV curves of an asymmetric SC based on Ti3C2Tx//SWCNT TCEs. The transparent asymmetric device possesses a T of 72% and a wider voltage window (1 V), in contrast to 0.65 V in the symmetric device. As a result, the energy density has been improved by ~five-fold, reaching 0.05 μWh/cm2 at a power density of 2.4 μW/cm2. The ascalculated energy density based on the asymmetric device has surpassed any other transparent SCs. Moreover, no capacitance decay is observed after 20,000 cycles; the high Coulombic efficiency (100%) indicates the excellent performances are not due to other parasitic reactions [27]."

Although the FoMe in the current Ti3C2Tx TCEs reaches 15, a relatively ordinary value and could not meet the requirement in the display field. However, there is still much room to further push the limits.\nWhile the optimization of the MXene synthesis and composition should be effective, understanding the influence of surface functionalities on the MXene electronic properties may be more effective. This includes the selectively removal of undesirable terminations for the sake of higher conductivity. Second, understanding the movement of charge carriers along the tunneling barriers is also crucial. Finally, building the nanosheet mesh on the flexible PET can substantially improves the transmittance of Ti3C2Tx TCEs. This requires a delicate design of thin film fabrication.\nOn the side of charge storage, the Ti3C2Tx films are proved as an efficiently transparent conductor and active material for high-performance capacitive charge storage, including high areal and volumetric capacitances in the supercapacitor electrode, with long lifetime, high energy density, and power handing in the prototype transparent solid-state device. Through optimizing the electrolyte/electrode interface, the voltage window of MXene can be extended to a more negative potential, leading to a broadened voltage window for the device and, consequently, much improved energy density and power density.\nThe achieved optoelectronic properties coupled with excellent volumetric capacitance and prototype performance show that the flexible Ti3C2Tx TCEs hold great promise in many areas, such as touch panel, displays, organic solar cells, transparent energy storage devices, wearable electronics, etc., to name just a few."

Fueled by the progress in nanomaterial synthesis and characterization, clinical care is transitioning from the era of biomedical devices implanted in the human body to support, restore, or replace functions at the organ or system level to the era of nano-biotechnologies that act at the cellular or subcellular scale to deliver therapeutic interventions.

Vitale et al.\nexcretion, and cellular uptake of the nanomaterials are of paramount importance and must be taken into account to ensure the feasibility for clinical translation. Over the past few decades, several classes of nanomaterials with a wide range of topologies such as nanospheres, nanowires, nanoribbons, and cages have been successfully engineered for application in drug delivery, tissue engineering, molecular and DNA sensing, neuromodulation, and cancer treatment platforms.\nSince the discovery of graphene and the recognition of its unique electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties compared to the 1D, 3D, and bulk forms of carbons, dimensionality has emerged as one of the most relevant material parameters for nanomaterials and one of the most influential factors in determining its performance in biomedicine. 2D nanomaterials possess extremely high surface area, which makes them uniquely suited for applications based on surface interactions at the microscale, such as drug delivery, biosensing, and anti-biofouling membranes. Furthermore, the surface-to-volume ratio and the high elastic modulus of many 2D nanomaterials make them particularly attractive as reinforcements for biocomposites or mechanically tunable scaffolds for stem-cell and tissue engineering. Finally, the extreme thinness and controllable size of 2D nanomaterials allow them to be easily internalized by the cells via physiological processes (i.e., endocytosis) and to rapidly respond to external stimuli, making them particularly useful for localized photothermal and photodynamic cancer treatments, or as nanocontrast agents for diagnostic imaging. Fueled by the excitement sparked by graphene discovery and extensive characterization, a number of 2D nanomaterials have been now explored in several areas of biomedicine (Fig. 26.1) [1, 2].\nIn light of these considerations, it is no surprise that in recent years, MXenes have also emerged as candidate 2D nanomaterials to interface with biological systems and to serve as building blocks in nano-biotechnology platforms. From the topological perspective, MXenes share all the advantageous properties of other classes of 2D nanomaterials stemming from their extreme thinness, high surface area, high surface-to-volume ratio, and mechanical toughness. However, there are several other features that are unique to MXenes and make them particularly attractive for biomedical applications. First, the rich chemistry on the surface of MXenes provides abundant reactive sites for enzyme or drug functionalization. The hydrophilic surface of MXenes makes them soluble in aqueous solutions, which avoids the need for potentially toxic organic solvents and enables facile solution processing and integration within high-throughput microfabrication schemes. Finally, the high surface area, volumetric capacitance, and metallic conductivity are highly desirable for low-noise, high fidelity biosensors.\nSince 2016, MXenes have attracted significant attention in the biotechnology community, and an increasing number of studies have been dedicated to exploring the potential of MXenes in the biomedicine arena. As of March 2018, the published works on this topic have been focused on three main areas: (1) biosensors for biomarker detection, bioelectronic sensing, and wearable technologies, (2) localized multimodal therapy and diagnostic imaging for cancer theranostics, and (3) antimicrobial and anti-biofouling treatments (Fig. 26.1). In this chapter, we will first review and discuss the processing, fabrication, and characterization of\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 505\nMXene-based biomedical technologies and compare their performance with other classes of 2D nanomaterials. Then in the last section, we will discuss the preliminary indications on biosafety and biocompatibility of MXenes when interfaced with biological systems, both in vitro and in vivo."

In recent years, several classes of 2D nanomaterials have been at the forefront of biosensor technology development, thanks to their unique geometries, physicochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Since their introduction in 2011, MXenes have gained significant attention for their excellent electronic and physicochemical properties, with Ti3C2 in particular as the most widely studied MXene constituent [3, 4].

      "text" : "At the molecular level, electrochemical biosensors can be used to detect a variety of analytes and metabolites such as nitrides, hydrogen peroxides, and glucose. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are important groups of free radicals that can induce oxidative and nitrosative stress leading to protein and cell damage and a range of severe functional consequences [5]. To understand the effect of these species on cell functions and their contributions to disease, it is essential to reliably detect and measure their concentrations in biological media. Mediator-free electrochemical biosensors rely on direct electron transfer (DET) between immobilized electroactive enzymes and the electrode surface after these enzymes facilitate redox reactions with the analyte of interest. However, the electroactive centers of most enzymes are located deep within the protein structure, and enzymes often denature and lose bioactivity when immobilized on an electrode [6]. Thus, it is crucial to design electrodes that provide a favorable microenvironment for enzymes to adsorb and retain their electroactivity. Several 2D nanomaterials, including graphene, layered MoS2, and titanate nanosheets, have been used to build efficient, mediator-free biosensors on account of their biocompatibility, high electrical conductivity, and high specific surface areas [7– 9]. More recently, Ti3C2 MXene has been demonstrated as another, extremely promising electrode material for mediator-free biosensors for a range of molecules.\nWang et al. proposed a scheme to immobilize hemoglobin (Hb) onto Ti3C2 MXene electrodes to perform highly sensitive detection of H2O2 with a wide linear detection range [10]. This scheme relies on multilayer Ti3C2 MXene processed into an accordion—or organ-like structure—with very large specific surface area to support enzyme immobilization. The organ-like structure funnels enzymes toward the interior of the nanolayers, and surface terminations (such as hydroxyl groups) support adsorption of enzymes onto the surface, thus promoting immobilization. This unique MXene structure provides a favorable microenvironment for enzyme entrapment while also increasing the chance of effective collisions between the substrate and redox protein; furthermore, it decreases the likelihood of enzyme detachment during reaction with the substrate. The performance of this MXene-based biosensor was investigated by amperometry and showed significant improvements in H2O2 sensing, with both a lower detection limit (20 nM) and a wider linear detection range (0.1–260 μM) than previously reported sensors (Fig. 26.2).\nElectrochemical biosensing of metabolites also has clinical applications for chronic disorders such as diabetes, where blood glucose monitoring is a valuable tool in the management of the disease. Enzymatic glucose biosensors typically take advantage of glucose oxidase (GOx) for detection because of its high selectivity\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 507\nfor glucose. In this type of biosensor, immobilized GOx catalyzes the oxidation of β-D-glucose by molecular oxygen, producing gluconic acid and H2O2 [11]. Glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) are commonly used as the electrode material on which GOx is immobilized. However, the redox potential of H2O2 over the GCE is relatively high. Recently, Rakhi et al. demonstrated a novel glucose biosensor based on a composite of Ti3C2 MXene and gold (Au) nanoparticles [12]. The high specific surface area, metallic conductivity, and hydrophilic surface of Ti3C2 MXene make it\n508 F. Vitale et al.\nan excellent material for the transducing matrix of a glucose biosensor. The addition of Au nanoparticles into this matrix increased the activity of GOx and improved the electrical conductivity and enzyme immobilization characteristics of the electrode structure. A comparison between the performances of this MXene/Au glucose sensor to previously reported biosensors—many of which were based on composites of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)—showed comparable performance with regard to detection limit, sensitivity, and linear detection range. Furthermore, the MXene/Au glucose sensor showed excellent stability, reproducibility, and repeatability over time, retaining 93% of its initial response current after 2 months of storage."

      "text" : "In addition to enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors, MXene has also been incorporated into field effect transistor (FET) sensors for measuring the activity of neurons in culture. In their 2016 work, Xu et al. demonstrated a Ti3C2 MXene FET that could both measure dopamine concentrations and record the electrical activity of neurons cultured on the FET [13]. Taking advantage of MXene’s hydrophilic nature, the authors developed a microcontact printing method for micropatterning very thin layers of MXene, which enabled simple, high-throughput device fabrication. In contrast, micropatterning methods for other carbon-based nanomaterials are typically low-throughput, complicated, and time-consuming and thus preclude scale-up to large-scale manufacturing. Similar to the other electrochemical biosensors discussed above, the MXene FET could be used to detect small biological molecules, particularly the neurotransmitter dopamine. In this case, the method of detection relies on interactions between dopamine molecules and free electrons in the functional terminals on the MXene surface that increase the number of electron holes, resulting in increased conductance of the FET. The MXene FET offered detection limits as low as 100 nM and exhibited highly linear conductance modulation for concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 50 μM. This dopamine detection limit is significantly lower than previously reported values for graphenebased dopamine biosensors [14, 15]. Additionally, when neurons on the device fired action potentials, neurotransmitters were released and bound to the MXene surface, inducing a fluctuation of electrical signals. Thus, the MXene FET could also record the electrical activity of the neurons cultured on the device with high sensitivity. Furthermore, because the MXene patterns were ~5 nm in thickness, the device was nearly transparent, allowing for simultaneous calcium imaging microscopy to visualize neuron activity and confirm the correlation between FET current fluctuations and spiking events. This demonstration revealed that the MXene FET achieved far better temporal resolution than the widely used calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4, because the FET captured action potentials that could not be resolved by calcium imaging alone, due to the slow dynamics of calcium signaling in neurons.\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 509"

      "text" : "Recently, stretchable, wearable electronics to monitor human motion and activity have attracted tremendous attention for personalized health monitoring, human motion detection, and closed-loop control of prosthetic devices [16–18]. Conventional strain gauge sensors based on metal and semiconductor materials can detect only a narrow range of strain (<5%) and exhibit low gauge factors (GF ≈ 2) due to their rigid nature. The GF is the ratio of relative change in electrical resistance to mechanical strain and is often used as a figure of merit for strain gauge sensors. Because of the limitations of brittle metals and semiconductors, a variety of alternative nanomaterials, including graphene, carbon black, CNTs, metal nanoparticles, and nanowires, have been used to design skin-like strain sensors with stretchabilities of up to 800% strain, GF as large as 3000, and sensing strain limits as low as 0.008% [19]. Despite these impressive advances, integrating a broad range of capabilities into a single, highly sensitive, tunable, microscale sensor to detect deflections as small as artery pulses and as large as entire body motions remains a challenge. In 2018, Cai et al. demonstrated a versatile Ti3C2 MXene/CNT composite-based strain sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity and a tunable sensing range [19]. Ti3C2 MXene and CNT layers were assembled in a “sandwich-like” structure created by using delaminated MXene flakes and hydrophilic single-walled CNTs assembled through a layer-by-layer spray coating technique. This composite structure allowed MXene and interconnected CNT layers to readily change their overlapping areas and interconnecting pathways through reversible slipping, allowing the network to maintain high conductivity during large strains. This skin-attachable strain sensor could reliably detect and differentiate small deformations of the throat during speaking of different words, as well as large deformations of the knee associated with walking, running, and jumping. The sensor could detect strains as low as 0.1% and as high as 130%, showed high sensitivity (GF as high as 772.6) and ultrathin dimensions (<2 μm in thickness), and could maintain reliable sensing performance through >5000 bending cycles. This MXene/CNT-based strain sensor, whose performance could in large part be attributed to MXene’s excellent electronic and mechanical properties, represents a significant improvement in the development of a wearable sensor for tracking physiological signals for health, robotics, and sporting applications.\nLike strain gauge sensors, skin-wearable or implantable piezoresistive pressure sensors can also be used to monitor a range of human motions and physiologic phenomenon. Ma et al. took advantage of the unique multilayer structure of Ti3C2 MXene that results after selective etching of the Al layer in the precursor Ti3AlC2 MAX phase to develop a piezoresistive sensor that could detect human motions ranging from subtle changes in facial expression to the large knee, elbow, and ankle flexion/extension [20]. As pressure was applied, the distance between adjacent MXene layers changed and resulted in electric current that monotonically increased with pressure. This MXene pressure sensor, which was discussed in detail in Chap. 24, represents another biosensor application for which MXene has proven to be a very promising material.\n510 F. Vitale et al."

      "text" : "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with the number of deaths projected to increase by more than 60% within the next two decades [21]. The fundamental mechanisms behind the cancer tumorigenesis, metastasis, and angiogenesis are still not well understood, and there is also a significant variability between the different forms of cancer. As a result, the outcomes of traditional treatments such as surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are still far from satisfactory. Furthermore, all these therapeutic approaches are highly nonspecific, invasive, and are often associated with increased risk of side effects and cancer recurrence.\nHyperthermia is attracting increasing attention as a cancer treatment option, and, when used in association with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can improve therapeutic outcomes [22]. Among the various modalities that have been proposed to induce localized heating of the tumor tissue, such as focused ultrasound, magnetic field, and microwaves, photothermal therapy (PTT) with near infrared (NIR) radiation has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional treatments, because of the high site specificity, minimal damage to normal tissue, and high ablation efficiency. PTT platforms rely on the introduction of photothermal conversion agents (PTAs) inside tumor cells, which can be activated via NIR irradiation at low intensity/power density and wavelength in the first (650–950 nm) or second biological window (1000–1350 nm), where the low scattering and energy absorption allow maximum penetration of the radiation through the tissue [23, 24]. In the past few decades, a number of nanomaterials with different topologies have been explored as high-efficiency PTAs for PTT, including Au nanoparticles with different morphologies [24–26], nanoscale carbon allotropes [27–29], as well as other organic and inorganic nanomaterials like polypyrrole [30], PEDOT-PSS [31], CuS nanocrystals (NCs, [32]), iron oxide [33], and, more recently, several classes of layered 2D nanomaterials [34–36].\nThe first demonstration of a MXene PTT platform was based on Ti3C2 ultrathin nanosheets (NSs) [37]. To produce Ti3C2 NSs with lateral size compatible with cellular uptake (typically via endocytic pathways), the precursor MAX phase was subjected to prolonged chemical exfoliation with 40% HF for 3 days, followed by intercalation with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH). This process yielded ultrathin Ti3C2 NSs with thickness of 0.6 nm and average lateral size of 150 nm (Fig. 26.3a). UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectroscopy on aqueous Ti3C2 solutions revealed a characteristic spectrum with peak absorption at ~800 nm, right within the first NIR absorption window (Fig. 26.3b). This optical behavior is similar to metal nanoparticles, such as Au and Ag, which exhibit localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) effect, and it is different from that of other 2D nanomaterials with a broad absorption range from UV to NIR range. The favorable properties of Ti3C2 as a PTA were also confirmed by an extinction coefficient of\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 511\n25.2 L g−1 cm−1 at 808 nm, which is significantly higher than graphene oxide NSs (3.6 L g−1 cm−1), Au nanorods (3.9 L g−1 cm−1), black phosphorous (BP) quantum dots (14.8 L g−1 cm−1) [38], and comparable to that of WS2 and MoS2 NSs [2]. Also, the photothermal conversion efficiency was found to be 30.6%, which is higher than Au nanorods (21%) [39], BP quantum dots (28%) [38], CuS2 NCs (22%) [40], and MoS2 NSs (24.4%) [35]. The excellent photothermal performance and stability were confirmed when Ti3C2 NSs were dispersed in aqueous solutions at 32 ◦C and exposed to 5 minutes on-off cycles of 808 nm laser irradiation at low power density (1.0 W cm−2). At concentrations as a low as 72 ppm, the temperature in the solution increased by more than 20 ◦C, and no performance deterioration was found during heating cycles (Fig. 26.3c, d). Although MXenes are stable in aqueous solutions for several weeks, the stability in saline solutions like the physiological extracellular fluid is rather poor, and precipitation of MXene NSs can be observed after just a few hours. In this work, Ti3C2 NSs were functionalized with\n512 F. Vitale et al.\nsoybean phospholipids (SP), which significantly improved the colloidal stability in several physiological media without affecting the photothermal properties of Ti3C2. Analysis of Ti3C2-SP NSs performance as PTA for cancer ablation in vitro on 4T1 breast cancer cells revealed that after 4 hours of incubation, the cells that were exposed to NIR irradiation at 808 nm and 1.0 W cm−2 power density showed significant decrease in viability and evidence of apoptotic processes in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 26.3e, f). For comparison, no effect was observed on the control groups that were left untreated, only incubated with Ti3C2-SP NSs without NIR irradiation, or exposed to the NIR laser in absence of Ti3C2 NSs. When the Ti3C2-SP NSs were injected in vivo intravenously in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, they preferentially accumulated in the tumor due to the characteristic high permeability of tumor blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage, a process known as enhanced permeability and retention (EPR). Exposure to NIR laser irradiation at 808 nm focused on the tumor site for 10 minutes caused the temperature to increase from 30 ◦C to 58 ◦C and resulted in the complete ablation of cancer cells (Fig. 26.3g). The effectiveness of the treatment was confirmed by the complete disappearance of tumors, lack of recurrence at 16 days posttreatment, and significant increase in survival rates compared to the groups that were left untreated, treated with NIR or with Ti3C2-SP NSs only (Fig. 26.3h)."

      "text" : "In addition to PTT, the accurate localization of the tumor site is of high significance for early diagnosis, for guiding the NIR irradiation and minimizing the risk of damage to the surrounding healthy tissue and for monitoring posttreatment outcomes. Typical imaging modalities employed in cancer diagnostics are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and, more recently, photoacoustic imaging (PA). MRI is characterized by high sensitivity and soft-tissue contrast, CT offers very high spatial resolution, and PA allows higher penetration depths than optical modalities by detecting the ultrasound waves generated by the laser-irradiated tissue. The synthesis of novel contrast agents with concurrent multimodal imaging and therapeutic capabilities allows the development of theranostic platforms for synergistic imaging and treatment. MnOx NSs grown on Ti3C2 NSs via in situ redox reaction from a KMnO4 precursor followed by SP functionalization can act as contrast agents for a combined MRI, PA, and PTT theranostic platform [41]. The responsiveness of the surface MnOx NSs to pH results in a unique pHdependent increase in the MRI signal intensity in acidic conditions, which are characteristic of the tumor microenvironment (~pH 6.0 compared to pH 7.4 of healthy tissue). Additionally, Mn is an abundant element in the human body and has inherently higher biosafety than the clinically adopted Gd2+-based contrast agents for MRI, which have a long retention time in the body and have been\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 513\nassociated with potentially toxic side effects [42, 43]. Finally, the high photothermal conversion efficiency (22.9%) endows the MnOx/Ti3C2-SP with enhanced PA signal in the tumor post intravenous injection, which gradually increases with time due to the EPR effect, and high-efficacy in 4T1 breast cancer cell ablation and growth suppression, both in vitro and in vivo.\nTo realize a theranostic platform integrating the X-ray CT imaging together with MRI and PA modalities while retaining the high photothermal conversion efficiency and the abundant surface chemistry of MXenes, it is possible to substitute the Ti in the M-phase with Ta, a transition metal with a higher atomic number (Z = 73) and X-ray attenuation coefficient (4.3 cm2 g−1 at 100 keV) [44]. Ta4C3 MXene displays high, concentration-dependent light absorption in the broad UV-VIS-NIR wavelength range without the characteristic peak at ~800 nm of Ti3C2 [45, 46]. However, the photothermal conversion efficiency of Ta4C3 MXene (>30%) as well as the stability under on-off cycles of NIR irradiation is comparable to Ti3C2. Thus, Ta4C3 MXene functionalized with MnOx [45] or superparamagnetic ironoxide nanoparticles (IONP) [46] and stabilized with SP can realize a multimodal imaging and therapeutic platform for cancer theranostics, where the Ta component is employed for enhanced-contrast in situ CT imaging, the MnOx or IONP as contrast agents for MRI (Fig. 26.3i), and Ta4C3 as high-efficiency PTA for PA imaging for hyperthermia and ablation of cancer."

      "text" : "In addition to in situ growth of nanoscale contrast agents for enhanced tumor imaging, the high surface area and the rich surface chemistry of MXenes provide abundant anchoring sites for therapeutic drug molecules, thus offering the potential to integrate PTT, chemotherapy, and imaging within a single platform. For example, the surface-exposed (OH−) groups in Ti3C2-SP MXenes can electrostatically adsorb cationic molecules such as doxorubicin (Dox), a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used to treat cancer [47, 48]. Such functionalization scheme can result in drug loading capability as high as 211% [48]. Once the Ti3C2-SP-Dox NSs penetrate inside the cells, the release of the drug can be triggered endogenously, by the acidic tumor microenvironment through the interference of H+ ions with the electrostatic interaction between Dox and Ti3C2-SP, or exogenously via NIR irradiation. Compared to the individual therapeutic modalities, Ti3C2-SP-Dox for synergistic chemotherapy and PTT leads to enhanced inhibition of cancer cell viability in vitro and improves therapeutic and recurrence outcomes in vivo. Additionally, specific targeting, retention, and responsiveness can be improved by coating Ti3C2-Dox with molecules that can specifically target species that are abundant in the tumor microenvironment. For example, coating Ti3C2-Dox with hyaluronic acid increases colloidal stability and actively targets the surface protein CD44+ overexpressed in\n514 F. Vitale et al.\nbreast cancer cells [47]. This work also demonstrated the potential of Ti3C2 MXene as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT), an additional localized cancer treatment modality. PDT is based on the release of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) when a photosensitizer co-localized within the cancer cells is exposed to light radiation [49]. Upon NIR irradiation, the energy transfer of photoexcited electrons from Ti3C2 to triplet oxygen(3O2) generates singlet oxygen (1O2), similar to graphene quantum dots [50] and BP [51].\nThe schematic illustration in Fig. 26.4 summarizes the synthesis scheme and the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of MXene-based theranostic nanoplatforms against cancer, including PTT/PDT, drug delivery, and multimodal imaging."

While Ti3C2 and Ta4C3 MXenes display a marked optical absorbance and photothermal response only in the NIR I biowindow, Nb2C shows strong, broad, and almost constant optical\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 515\nabsorption encompassing the NIR I and NIR II biowindows [52]. The extinction coefficients of Nb2C stabilized with biocompatible polyvinylpyrrolidone are 37.6 and 35.4 L g−1 cm−1 at 808 nm and 1064 nm, respectively, while the reported photothermal conversion efficiencies are 36.5% at 808 nm and 46.65% at 1064 nm, thus confirming the potential of Nb2C as PTA in the broad NIR I–II range.\nFinally, a very promising feature for enhancing the biocompatibility and translation potential of theranostic nanoplatforms is the possibility of controlling the lifetime of the nanoagents in the body and reducing the potential risks related to body retention of nanomaterials and their by-products. This could be achieved by designing active biodegradation schemes that leverage the natural clearance pathways of the body’s immune system. A first step in this direction is the biodegradation scheme for Nb2C NSs based on human myeloperoxidase (hMPO), a free-radical species generating enzyme expressed by neutrophils to carry out their antimicrobial activity [52]. In the presence of H2O2, hMPO generates hypochlorous acid and reactive radical intermediates, which degrade polymers and carbon-based materials. The incubation of Nb2C NSs in hMPO- and H2O2-enriched medium for 24 hours has been reported to cause the complete degradation and disappearance of NSs, thus demonstrating in vitro the feasibility of this enzyme-triggered degradation route for MXenes."

      "text" : "Wastewater treatment is a part of the broader field of sanitation and involves the conversion of wastewater (e.g., sewage or gray water) into a cleaner form, called “effluent,” which can be reused to satisfy human needs or else be returned to the environment with little-to-no adverse effects. Wastewater treatment remains an important challenge in the twenty-first century, motivated by factors like the increasing global population, higher standards of living, and climate change [53].\nTo improve current wastewater treatment processes, many noble metal nanoparticles, as well as CNTs, graphene oxide (GO), and other graphene-based nanomaterials, have been implemented as antibacterial coatings for wastewater treatment membranes. These nanomaterials share high specific surface areas, as well as the ability to generate ROS. A high specific surface area means that there are more sites for adsorption of contaminants onto the membrane, which facilitates large-scale removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from a wastewater environment [53]. Additionally, ROS can cause physiochemical damage to the structures of bacterial cells through the mechanisms of oxidative stress [53, 54], resulting in bacterial growth inhibition. Recent investigations into the antibacterial activity of MXenes have shown that they behave in ways unique and different from other nanomaterials that have been previously explored.\nThe high specific surface area and degree of hydrophilicity of MXenes promote the adhesion of particulates in the aqueous environment. This favorable adsorption behavior of MXene has been recently reported by Jastrzebska et al. [55], who\n516 F. Vitale et al.\nexplored the biosorption properties of expanded Ti2C MXene nanosheets against three model bacteria: Bacillus sp. (found in the human gastrointestinal tract), S. aureus (common to the respiratory system), and Sarcina (found in the large intestine). After successfully splitting Ti2AlC MXene into individual sheets of Ti2C, cultures of the three bacteria in 0.05 mg/200 μL of Ti2C were suspended in a drinking water environment and incubated at 37 ◦C for 30 mins. Scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed that all strains of bacteria readily adsorbed onto the Ti2C sheets, with some cells even attached to sites between the individual layers (Fig. 26.5). Another interesting finding was that the zeta potential for the Ti2C MXene after the adsorption of each type of bacterial cell changed to reflect the zeta potential of the bacteria itself. The zeta potential reflects the stability existing between electrically charged components in a colloidal dispersion, such that this adjustment of the Ti2C zeta potential to that of the bacterial cells indicates that when bacteria adsorb to the Ti2C, they become electrically stabilized, thus implying a more stable adsorption process.\nOne major concern that arises in the case of other nanomaterials with high adsorption rates in antibacterial coatings is the issue of biofouling. For example, although adding hydrophilic metal oxide nanoparticles to a membrane increases its adsorption properties, as more bacteria adhere to the membrane, there is increased possibility that these cells will form a biofilm that reduces the permeability of the membrane and decreases its overall effectiveness [53]. One possible solution to prevent biofouling relies on damaging the bacteria that adhere to the membrane, and MXenes have proven to be very effective in this regard.\nIn 2016, Rasool et al. were able to fine-tune the antibacterial activity of Ti3C2 MXene by adjusting its concentration in a colloidal suspension [56]. Aqueous solutions of Ti3C2 at various concentrations were formulated, and colonies of E. coli and B. subtilis were treated with the mixtures for 4 hours. E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine, while B. subtilis is a Grampositive bacterium in the same genus as Bacillus sp. At a concentration of 2 μg/mL of Ti3C2, 92.53% of E. coli and 93.96% of B. subtilis cells survived contact with the MXene solution. These survival rates dropped dramatically to 35.31% for E. coli and 28.21% for B. subtilis, when the concentration of Ti3C2 was increased tenfold\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 517\nto 20 μg/mL. At the maximum concentration of 200 μg/mL, bacterial inhibition reached 99% for both model strains. Comparatively, for bacterial cultures suspended in 200 μg/mL of GO in aqueous solution, roughly 90% of cells were inactivated (Fig. 26.6a, b). Thus, Rasool et al. demonstrated that the bacterial inactivation rate of Ti3C2 MXene could be fine-tuned to be higher than that of GO. More importantly, in the same report, it was found that the high antibacterial activity in Ti3C2 MXene was independent of the presence of ROS in the MXene nanoparticles themselves. This distinguishes MXenes from most of the nanomaterials explored for use in wastewater treatment processes, which are thought to inactivate bacterial cells through oxidative stress via ROS generation.\nIn a follow-up work, Rasool et al. investigated the mechanisms of antibacterial activity of MXenes in the form of coatings for water purification membranes [57]. A Ti3C2 coating was applied to a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and E. coli and B. subtilis cultures were suspended on the surface of the membrane for 24 hours. After this time, 33% of the E. coli culture and 27% of the B. subtilis culture remained on the MXene-PVDF surface. When MXene coatings were allowed to oxidize for 24 hours before bacterial exposure, their antibacterial activity increased further, to the point that they inhibited >99% growth for both bacterial types upon exposure (see Fig. 26.6c). The highly hydrophilic Ti3C2 coating displayed a very rough topography, as well as a high density of surface defects, which were observed to cause physical damage and even rupturing of the bacterial cell wall. This study concluded that the stresses induced on the bacteria when in contact with the MXene coatings were more physical than oxidative in nature. It was found that damage to the bacterial cells resulted in cytoplasmic release and subsequent cell death. By directly causing cell death, the MXene coating effectively prevented formation of a bacterial biofilm on the PVDF membrane, thus mitigating the risk of biofouling.\n518 F. Vitale et al."

      "text" : "Compared to their bulk counterparts, the biocompatibility of nanomaterials cannot be directly inferred from their constituting elements as the size, shape, dispersion, surface charge, and hydrophilicity play a significant role in determining the body response to the foreign material. The primary mechanisms of nanomaterial-induced toxicity are (1) oxidative damage to the cells from the nanostructures themselves, by-products, or contaminants, (2) slow clearance through the renal pathway and accumulation in the organs, (3) damage to blood cells (i.e., hemolysis) and trombogenicity, (4) genotoxicity, and (5) specific toxicity to the reproductive, neural, or embryonic system. Thus, a comprehensive biosafety evaluation requires a thorough investigation of all the possible interactions between the nanomaterial and the living system, taking into account not only the different mechanisms of toxicity but also the effects of shape, size, and physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials themselves.\nThough still in its infancy, the interest in MXenes for biomedicine has generated some preliminary data on the cytocompatibility and biocompatibility of MXenes, particularly in the field of cancer theranostics. To date, Ti3C2 is the most commonly investigated form of MXenes, and several recent reports [37, 41, 47, 48] evidence the lack of significant apoptosis or signs of cytotoxicity when cancer cells are exposed to few nanometer-thin Ti3C2 NSs with lateral size of ~150–250 nm, at concentrations ranging from 6 to 600 ppm (Fig. 26.3e, f). When Ti3C2 NSs are injected in the bloodstream, they are excreted in the urine via physiologic renal clearance pathways or are retained in the tumor tissue via the EPR effect, without accumulating in the major organs. The advantageous biodistribution and systemic biosafety of Ti3C2 appear to be confirmed even after intravenous injections of high doses (up to 20 mg/kg), with no evidence of body weight loss, alteration of blood indexes, or necrotic processes at the major organ level at acute (1 day), subacute (7 days), and chronic (30 days) time scales [37, 41, 48] (Fig. 26.7a, b). Additional preliminary work indicates no sign of hemolytic damage to red blood cells in presence of Ti3C2 NSs [47] (Fig. 26.7c). Similar findings have been reported for the cytocompatibility and systemic biocompatibility for Ta4C3 [45, 46] and Nb2C MXenes [52].\nIn addition to reports suggesting the biocompatibility of MXene NSs dispersed in saline solutions and injected in the bloodstream, there are preliminary indications of the safety of MXenes when micropatterned on electronic films. Primary hippocampal neurons cultured on the MXene FET show normal cell morphology and well-elaborated neurite outgrowth after 1 week of exposure [13], despite the higher sensitivity of primary neuronal cultures to material and surface properties compared to immortalized cancer cell lines.\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 519"

      "text" : "Nanomaterial-based platforms are emerging as promising alternatives to traditional therapies for the diagnosis and treatment of a broad range of diseases, thanks to their high-specificity, efficacy, minimal invasiveness, and reduced risk of side effects. MXenes hold great potential for application in biomedicine as they combine the topological advantages of 2D nanomaterials with unique physicochemical properties such as surface reactivity, hydrophilicity, and metallic conductivity. Since 2016 the potential of MXenes as novel biomaterials has been investigated in the areas of biosensing, cancer theranostics, and antimicrobial treatments.\nIn the context of biosensing, Ti3C2 MXene shows excellent performance as an electrode material for enzymatic, mediator-free biosensing of ROS and RNS, as well as for high-sensitivity glucose monitoring systems, which can find relevant application in diabetes diagnosis and monitoring. Furthermore, Ti3C2 MXene can be processed into FETs for monitoring the electrical and chemical activities of cultured neurons at high resolution. The modulation of the optoelectronic properties of the MXene films offers the possibility of performing simultaneous optical imaging, which could enable a number of applications in neuroscience studies. Finally, Ti3C2 MXene shows promising potential for versatile, stretchable strain and pressure sensors, which enables applications in human healthcare monitoring.\nMXene-based theranostic platforms for multimodal imaging and ablation of cancer cells are characterized by higher photothermal conversion efficiency and optical absorbance in the NIR range compared to other nanostructures. The synthesis of\n520 F. Vitale et al.\nultrathin MXene NSs with ~150–200 nm lateral size via prolonged chemical etching enables cell uptake via endocytic pathways and preferential retention within the highly vascularized tumor structure. Cancer hyperthermia treatments with NIR laser in presence of Ti3C2, Ti4C3, or Nb2C co-localized within the tumor cells result in complete ablation, necrosis, and improved survival and recurrence rates. Furthermore, thanks to their rich surface chemistry, MXenes can be engineered into nanocontrast agents for multimodal, localized diagnostic imaging as well as into drug delivery vectors via in situ functionalization with superparamagnetic nanoparticles and drug molecules.\nWhen investigated as antibacterial membranes for wastewater treatment, Ti3C2 MXene exhibits stable bacterial adsorption at high rates, due to the high effective surface area and hydrophilicity. Ti3C2 MXene is also more effective than other nanomaterials at inhibiting bacterial growth: Ti3C2 coatings on PVDF membrane caused cell death for both Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive B. subtilis, despite the thickness difference in the cell walls between the two species. This finding has important implications for MXene use in true wastewater environments, because it implies that a MXene coating may have a certain degree of selectivity to allow for targeting only bacterial cells, without affecting other living cells in the same environment.\nThe introduction of new nanomaterials in the field of biomedicine requires a thorough evaluation of their biosafety and toxicity, as these are of paramount importance in determining the true potential for clinical translation. Given their relatively recent discovery, the amount of data regarding the biocompatibility of MXenes is still very limited. However, some preliminary assessments suggest that MXenes are compatible with cellular viability and growth and do not induce hemolytic damage to red blood cells in vitro. Furthermore, when engineered in ultrathin NSs, they can be excreted through the physiological renal clearance pathway and do not appear to induce any toxic effect in the major organs. These results are certainly encouraging and support the promising potential of MXenes as novel biomaterials. However, in order to establish the biocompatibility of MXenes, future extensive investigations must be conducted to take into account all the possible mechanisms of interaction between MXenes and living systems at chronic time scales.\nThe era of MXenes in biomedicine has just begun. The exceptional physicochemical properties and the number of species available in the library of MXenes open the unprecedented opportunity to fine-tune the material properties to the specific application and cellular targets, many of which are yet to be explored. Examples of areas for future investigation include mechanically and electrically responsive scaffolds for regenerative medicine [58], separation membranes for artificial organs [59], fluorescent intracellular probes [60], and implantable bioelectronic interfaces for neurotransmitter [61, 62] and bioelectronic signal detection [63].\n26 Biomedical Applications of MXenes 521"
