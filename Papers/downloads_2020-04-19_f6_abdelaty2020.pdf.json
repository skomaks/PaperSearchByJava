Locally isolated Penicillium chrysogenum MF318506 free from mycotoxins was selected as candidate for bio-synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The response surface methodology (RSM) of central composite design (CCD) was applied to control the biosynthesis of silver nano-size and activity depending on the pH of the reaction mixture and AgNO3 concentration. Changing conditions in the design showed different nano-sizes with different antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The best conditions for biosynthesis of biologically active AgNPs could be attained using the low metal concentrations (0.172 and 1.0 mM) with high pH values (8, 12&10) after 6 h incubation in dark conditions. The controlled nanoparticles were studied and characterized by UV–visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From this study we have concluded that the statistically controlled silver nano-size from Penicillium chrysogenum MF318506 can be utilized as a novel good candidate in biomedical research."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Nano-technology is one of the most effective and novel area of research in modern material science. This field of science is making a valuable impact in the life science, specially biotechnology and biomedical science (Gan and Li, 2012). Metal nanoparticles (MNP) introduce unique physical, chemical, electronic, and antimicrobial properties which make them suitable for their application in many fields including biosensing (Habouti et al., 2010), photonics (Hu and Chan, 2004), electronics (Alshehri et al., 2012), antimicrobials, anticancer (Salata, 2004; Chen et al., 2014) and in the biomedical fields for drug delivery and targeting (Cole et al., 2011; Sakamoto et al., 2010; Seigneuric et al., 2010). Silver nanoparticles are seemed to be one of the most valuable nanoparticles, that have been applied widely in different biomedical fields such as, cancer therapy, antimicrobial agent, anti-inflammatory factor and the delivery of drugs (Moghaddam et al., 2015; Vijayakumara et al., 2019).\nMetal nanoparticles are commonly synthesized via the reduction of metal salts in a solution (Zhang et al., 2011) or the formation of metal atom aggregates by the heating or vaporization of a metal in inert gas or\nvacuum (Tien et al., 2008). Size-controlled Ag NPs are also synthesized using new environment-friendly synthesis techniques (Mori et al., 2011). Recently, green synthetic approach for synthesis of non-toxic AgNPs using plant extracts like (leaves, flower, etc.), bacteria, fungi, and algae for the synthesis of nanoparticles offers a numbers of benefits of eco-friendliness and compatibility for pharmaceuticals and other biomedical applications, as they do not require toxic chemical for the synthesis process (Dhillon et al., 2012). Also the biogenic synthesis of metallic nanoparticles leads to the formation of capped nanostructures with proteins/biomolecules from the organism during the biosynthesis. These capping agents prevent nanoparticle aggregation and likely play an important role in the stabilization of the nanosystem. The presence of capping agents may improve the biocompatibility of biogenic nanomaterials (Seabra and Dur�an, 2015).\nThe application of fungal extracellular proteins has introduced an effective and a promising method for nanoparticles biosynthesis (Textor et al., 2010; El-Rafie et al., 2010; Sastry et al., 2004). Statistical designs of central composite (CCD) were recently used to optimize chemical or/and physical properties of nanoparticles, in this context the authors (Alivisatos, 1996; Bruchez et al., 1998; Coe et al., 2002) indicated that a\n* Corresponding author.

Azam et al. (2012) emphasized that the toxicological action of AgNPs depends greatly on several factors including the producer organism, particles size and the tested pathogen. When AgNPs penetrate to the cytoplasm it may interface with the cell proteins, lipids and DNA lead to disruption of macromolecules inside the living cells or freeing of metal ions such as Ag þwhich may because interruption in the microbial metabolism leading to their death (Brunner et al., 2006).\nThere is a need for green approaches to obtain metal nanoparticles for biomedical and technological applications and to highlight the critical need to fully investigate the nanotoxicity of these particles. Therefore, the aim of this work is the biogenesis of statically controlled different sizes of AgNPs with varied biological activities using local fungal isolate. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to find the most favorable experimental conditions like pH value and AgNO3 concentration for synthesis of ultrafine silver particles. Finally, an extensive screening study was conducted involving several pathogenic bacteria and fungi to identify a biological system for the different extracellular biosynthesized nano-sizes and their cytotoxic effects."

The diameter and the shape of Run 5 AgNPs were all shown to be spherical uniform and small sized in range from 2.68 to 7.12 nm with average of (5.26 � 1.66 nm). Nano size of Run 11 showed in range from 3.59 to 9.25 nm with average of (6.30 � 2.19 nm). These results partly agree with (Abd El Aty and Ammar, 2016).\nFTIR spectrum of silver nanoparticles and fungal extract was analyzed to detect the functional groups which involved in synthesizing process. Results obtained in (Fig. 8) indicated that there is a higher matching in characteristic beaks among the fungal extract and\nResults are represented by means of three replicates.\nA.A.

FTIR analyses revealed the appearance of distinctive bands at 1639.2, 1494.56, 1461.78, 1424.17, 3459.67, 3238.86 cm-1, correspond to the binding vibrations of amide I and amide II of protein, with N–H stretching’s. While the 2079.85 and 1874.47 cm 1 represents C–H stretching vibration. The bands obtained at 1314.25, 1235.18 and 1192 cm 1 can be assigned to C–N stretching vibrations of aliphatic and aromatic amines, respectively. That’s directly indicate the role of proteins as reducing and stabilizing agent.\nDLS analysis showed the particle size means were 35.2, 28.95 and 38.40 nm of Run 2, 5 and 11, respectively. The zeta potential endows stability of nanoparticles and surface charge. The zeta potential was found to be -22.3, -200.0 and -81.7 mV of Run 2, 5 and 11, respectively. Baker et al. (2005) mentioned that when the zeta potential value positions between 30 and 50 mV, it specifies good stability of nano particles. The high negative value substantiates the repulsion between the particles and thereby increases the stability of the AgNP’s."

      "text" : "Several of applications of nanomaterials take advantage of the engineering of AgNPs plasmonic response that depends on their size, shape, dielectric environment, and on mutual electromagnetic interactions among particles in close proximity (Ren and Tilley, 2007). LSPR is the consequence of the confinement of the electric field, within a small metallic sphere whose radius is much smaller than the wavelength (Catherine and Olivier, 2017). This property can be tuned by controlling parameters such as shape, size, uniformity and surface coating (Loiseau et al., 2019), and is often used for biosensing applications in the field of biology, biomedicine and biochemistry."

The ultrafine particles of AgNPs-2 with size ranged from 3.68 to 22.9 nm showed good antimicrobial activities better than AgNPs-1 against all tested strains, IZD in range from 13 to 23 mm diameter, except C. albicans able to resist all biosynthesized nanosilver.\nOut of the three runs selected from CCD, Run 11 (particles size in range from 3.59 to 9.25 nm) has the best antibacterial effect (IZD 22 and 23 mm), and showed good antifungal activity against the unicellular yeast fungus C. tropicalis ATCC750 (15 mm) and the filamentous fungi, F. solani NRC15 and A. niger NRC53 (22 and 21 mm, respectively). The antifungal activity of AgNPs is mainly due to its effects on the fungal mycelia and by targeting the yeast cell membranes and disrupting membrane potential (Kim et al., 2009).\nRun 2 showed antibacterial effect (with IZD of 16 and 20 mm) to some extend similar to its antifungal effect (with IZD of 15 and 21 mm). On the other hand, Run 5 has only inhibitory activity against the filamentous fungus A. niger NRC53 and F. solani NRC15 with IZD of 11 and 13 mm, respectively. The authors Morones et al. (2005) confirm our results, that the antimicrobial activity of AgNPs depends on their particles nano-size. In the same context Balachandar et al. (2019) showed good antibacterial activity of AgNPs biosynthesized from stem extract of Phyllanthus pinnatus against Vibrio cholera and Shigella flexneri. And another study of Kanagamani et al. (2019) explored the synthesis of AgNPs using Kleinia grandiflora leaf extract (KGLE) with significant antimicrobial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus\nniger, that indicate the biological activity mainly depends on the particles, shape and size not on the source. So we noticed that smaller particles have a large surface area in touch with the bacterial and fungal cells, and can diffuse or penetrate a bacterial cell membrane easily and inhibit its growth by interfering in the natural metabolism processes or interface with the biomolecules such as DNA, lipids and proteins lead to microbial death."

      "text" : "The broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of silver is well known. Moreover, many researches have presented the potential use of AgNPs as anticancer agents due to their important antiangiogenic properties (Raghunandan et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2007). The cytotoxic effect of 5 samples against two human cancer cells HCT-116 and MCF-7 were investigated (Table 4). Cultures of different cell lines were treated with AgNPs first at one concentration of 100 μg/ml and the results showed one sample (Run 2) possessed moderate cytotoxic effect against colon cancer (HCT-116) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines (43.5% and 51.5%, respectively), on the other hand, the rest samples showed weakly cytotoxic effect against cancer cell lines tested. It was elucidated that AgNPs can be uptake by cells through diffusion or endocytosis mechanisms including macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, fluid phase endocytosis, and PI3/Akt mediated endocytosis causing cell damage due to excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including the superoxide radical (O-2) and H2O2, impairment in mitochondrial function, along with activation of signaling pathways inhibiting cell proliferation (Zhang et al., 2016).\nThe impact of silver nanoparticles against human colon adenocarcinoma was previously reported by Basu et al. (2015). In addition, Yehia and Al-Sheikh (2014) showed that silver nanoparticles has potential anticancer activity against MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines. From other biological sources Moteriya and Chanda (2018) investigated the genotoxicity of phytosynthesized AgNPs with an average size of 8 nm against normal human lymphocytes. No genotoxicity was found up to 50 ug, but fragmented DNA was observed at 200 ug. AgNPs with an average size of 49.98 nm synthesized via a fungus-mediated method caused DNA damage in NCI-H460 cells in a time-dependent manner at 2–20 ug.\nDose response study: The data presented in (Table 5) showed sample of Run 2 has highest cytotoxic activity against colon cancer and breast cancer cell lines with IC50 values (106.9 and 90.3 ug/ml μg/ml, respectively), this result indicated that the maximum cytotoxic effect of Run 2 showed 50% reduction in cell viability upon treatment with highest dose (100ug/ml). Nanoparticles with their small size (around 9.74 � 5.23 nm) are able to interact with larger biological molecules both intra and extracellular and they are internalized inside mammalian cells by uptake mechanisms as endocytosis. In this way, Liu et al. (2010) showed that nanoparticles (NPs) introduce a number of possibilities for treatment and diagnosis of cancer.\nThe most active samples which possessing high anticancer activity (�40) have been further tested for their cytotoxicity on human normal cell line HFB4 to evaluate their safety on normal cells. The data presented in (Table 6) showed, the selected sample showed weakly cytotoxic effect (33.6%) against normal melanocyte cell line (HFB4), this value means that the selected sample is more cytotoxic to the tumor cell lines as compared with the normal cell line, where Barabadi et al. (2019c) indicated that a recent 2018 meta-analysis data of cytotoxicity of biogenic MNPs in cancer cell lines was 9 times higher than that in normal cell lines, indicating much greater MNP cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines. Significant toxic effects of biogenic AgNPs with inhibitory concentration of 50% in breast cancer cell lines explained by Barabadi et al. (2019d) who expected that biogenic AgNPs may emerge as potential breast cancer therapeutic agents alone or in combination with FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs in the near future.\nA.A.

Therefore, this study focused on the use of the novel fungal strain Penicillium chrysogenum MF318506 for biosynthesis of nano-silver. Two–factors–5–levels central composite design of RSM was applied to achieve all possible combinations of input variable that are able to affect the shape and size of nanoparticles. Several characterization analyses were applied to confirm the biosynthesis of nanoparticles including, the UV visible spectrum at the absorption range of 400–450 nm, HR-TEM analysis which showed the size, shape and crystal lattice structure of the synthesized particles. In addition, the FTIR spectrum and size particles diffraction analysis (DLS) has been applied. The biosynthesized nanoparticles of different sizes obtained from Run 2, Run 5 and Run 11 showed different effects against panel of different Gram positive and negative bacteria and fungi. The cytotoxic efficacy of the all prepared samples against HCT-116 and MCF-7 carcinoma was evaluated and Run 2 has the highest cytotoxic activity against colon cancer and breast cancer cell lines with IC50 values (106.9 and 90.3 μg/ml, respectively).\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThere is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."

    "abstractText" : "Biogenesis of metal nanoparticles draws significant attention due to environment eco-friendly and sustainable methods. Locally isolated Penicillium chrysogenum MF318506 free from mycotoxins was selected as candidate for bio-synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The response surface methodology (RSM) of central composite design (CCD) was applied to control the biosynthesis of silver nano-size and activity depending on the pH of the reaction mixture and AgNO3 concentration. Changing conditions in the design showed different nano-sizes with different antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The best conditions for biosynthesis of biologically active AgNPs could be attained using the low metal concentrations (0.172 and 1.0 mM) with high pH values (8, 12&10) after 6 h incubation in dark conditions. The controlled nanoparticles were studied and characterized by UV–visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From this study we have concluded that the statistically controlled silver nano-size from Penicillium chrysogenum MF318506 can be utilized as a novel good candidate in biomedical research.",
