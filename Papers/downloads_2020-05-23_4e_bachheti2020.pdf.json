      "text" : "Forest tree species are very much important to the lives of people and animals. They supply several basic needs, for example, food, fruits, medicine, fodder, fuelwood, timber, and environmental protection. Additionally, these tree species are rich in terms of flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, sterols, waxes, fats, tannins, sugars, gums, suberins, resin acids, and other secondary metabolites. In recent years, many forest tree species and their chemicals/products have been used for the production of nanomaterials (NMs). This procedure is known as “green synthesis” and considered as simple, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach in\nNanomaterials for Agriculture and Forestry Applications. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-817852-2.00004-4 © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 81\ncomparison to routinely used chemical and physical fabrication processes. In fact, green synthesis or fabrication of nanoparticles (NPs) focuses on the production of desired products without generation of hazardous by products (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a,b; Veisi et al., 2016; Sowmiya and Prakash, 2018; Oves et al., 2018; Izadiyan et al., 2018; Lembang et al., 2018; Siddiqi et al., 2018a,b,c, 2019; Husen, 2017, 2019a,b; Joshi et al., 2019; Bachheti et al., 2019).\nThe available metabolites in extract act as reducing and stabilizing agents for the bioreduction reaction to fabricate the metallic NPs. The quality, stability, shape, size, and overall production of NPs varies from one tree species to other. These processes are known to influence by monitoring the extract concentration, types of reducing agents, pH of reaction solution, time of incubation, temperature, light intensity, and so on (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014b; Husen et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2019). Further, the measurement of physical and chemical features of NPs is accomplished through several techniques for instance, UV vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, zeta potential, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and so on. Unlike bulk materials, NPs have unique optical, thermal, electrical, chemical, and physical features. Thus they find a broad range of potential applications, such as in the areas of medicine, cosmetics, paints, electronics, biosensors, agriculture, cancer control, food packaging, bioremediation, and so on. (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a,c; Souza and Fernando, 2016; Siddiqi and Husen, 2016; Siddiqi et al., 2018d; López-Miranda et al., 2019; Husen and Iqbal, 2019; Husen, 2019a; Raffi and Husen, 2019; Wagay et al., 2019; Singh and Husen, 2019; Naz et al., 2019; Gayda et al., 2019). This chapter provides a comprehensive survey on the green synthesis of forest tree mediated NPs with specific focus on their biomedical applications."

      "text" : "Acer saccharum (maple) leaf and pine needle extracts were utilized for the fabrication of gold NPs (Au-NPs). TEM studies revealed quasi-spherical to triangular prisms (Krishnaswamy and Orsat, 2015). Cellulose obtained from pine needle was utilized for the preparation of oxidized cellulose NPs (Kumari et al., 2018). 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical and sodium periodate were used for oxidation trailed by sonication. Doxorubicin was loaded on the synthesized oxidized cellulose NPs and its release behavior in the tumor was studied at different pH. Maximum Doxorubicin release was at pH 5.0 (endosomal) and pH 6.8 (extracellular). Outcome of the study shows that pH-responsive oxidized cellulose NPs are effective and promising Doxorubicin-delivery carriers for cancer treatment with less side effect to the normal cells. Sowmiya and Prakash (2018) used Abies\n82 CHAPTER 4 Nanomaterials from various forest tree species\nwebbiana for green synthesis of silver NPs (Ag-NPs) and were characterized by using UV vis, FTIR, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Table 4.1). Aqueous leaves extract of Acer pentapomicum was used by Khan et al. (2018) for synthesis of Au-NPs which acts as reducing as well as stabilizing agents. UV vis, SEM, EDX, XRD, and FTIR techniques were used for the characterization which shows size range of NPs was 19 24 nm. The synthesized NPs showed antioxidant activity, antimicrobial, fungicidal, and candidacidal activities against various tested species (Table 4.1).\nLike other parts of plant, numerous researchers also utilize the bark for synthesis of NP. For instance, Acacia leucophloea bark extract was reported for the fabrication of Ag-NPs (Murugan et al., 2014). Surface plasmon resonance at 440 nm and formation of yellow-brown color indicates the formation of Ag-NPs. TEM images show mostly spherical Ag-NPs with the size of 17 29 nm. FTIR indicate the presence of primary amines, aldehyde/ketone, aromatic, azo, and nitro compounds in A. leucophloea extract and may be responsible for bioreduction. Synthesized Ag-NPs shows more activity than A. leucophloea extract when tested against Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 737), Bacillus cereus (MTCC 1272), Listeria monocytogenes (MTCC 657), and Shigella flexneri (MTCC 1475). Nayak et al. (2016) checked the potentials of bark extracts of Ficus benghalensis and Azadirachta indica for the fabrication of Ag-NPs. The synthesized NPs were characterized by UV vis, FESEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and XRD, which indicates that synthesized NPs were crystalline in nature with average size of B 40 and B 50 nm each. Prosopis juliflora bark extract was employed for the synthesis of Ag-NPs at different conditions. Optimum condition for Ag-NPs synthesis was at 25 C when 9.5 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 was added with 0.5 mL of bark extract for 40 min. SEM studies revealed spherical-shaped NPs whose size vary between B10 and 50 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) shows that hydrodynamic diameter of Ag-NPs was B55 nm (Arya et al., 2018). Iravani and Zolfaghari (2013) utilized Pinus eldarica bark for Ag-NPs synthesis. The effect of pH, temperature, substrate concentration, and quantity of extract were studied for the formation of Ag-NPs and experimental conditions were optimized. Most of the NPs synthesized were spherical in shape with size range 10 40 nm. The aerial root extract of F. benghalensis (banyan tree) was utilized for the synthesis of Au-NPs (Rakhi et al., 2013). FTIR of root extract showed the presence of hydroxyl group. Most of the synthesized Au-NPs were spherical in shape with size 13 17 nm along with some triangular, pentagonal, rod-like structures. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) showed formation of crystalline Au-NPs.\nAg-NPs were fabricated using pine pollen by Khatami et al. (2017). Color change from colorless to reddish brown showed Ag-NPs formation. Stability particles indicated that Ag-NPs with 1 mM AgNO3 were stable for 5 months, and those with 2.5, 4.0, and 5.0 mM were stable for 2, 1, and 1 months, respectively. XRD analysis showed the face centered cubic structure of NPs.

Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) showed the presence of silver element in synthesized Ag-NPs. TEM revealed size of NP was 20 100 nm (Velmurugan et al., 2013). Sabela et al. (2018) fabricated two Ag-NPs from aqueous extracts of Ilex mitis root bark: (1) Ag-NPs-SPNs from saponins (SPNs) of I. mitis root bark and (2) Ag-NPs-DTPs from diterpenes (DTPs) of I. mitis root bark. These synthesized NPs were characterized by TEM, DLS, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), attenuated total reflectance (ATR), XRD, and UV vis. The average size of Ag-NPs-SPNs and Ag-NPs-DTPs were 50 and 156 nm, respectively. Further details of metal-oxide NPs synthesis, used tree parts or chemicals/products, characterization techniques, and their applications are given in Table 4.1."

      "text" : "Aluminum-oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3-NPs) were prepared from leaf extract of Prunus x yedoensis at different pH (3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) conditions, and it was found that pH 7 is suitable for the synthesis of NPs. The surface morphology changes with change in pH. Formation of hexagonal structures was observed at pH 7, while formation of plate-like structures of NPs was seen at pH 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) revealed that most of the Al2O3-NPs were spherical and hexagonal in shape, and the size ranged between 50 and 100 nm. The EDS showed the presence of four dominant elements (Al, C, Na, and O) in Al2O3 (Manikandan et al., 2019).\nAnother investigation reported about the solution combustion synthesis of zinc-oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) using plant extracts as biofuels. In this study, Prashanth et al. (2018) used lactose and aqueous leaf extracts of Abutilon indicum, Melia azedarach, and Indigofera tinctoria. Wurtzite hexagonal structure was determined by XRD. From the morphological study, it was observed that the samples prepared using biofuel had smaller diameter than those prepared by using lactose as fuel. Surface characteristics were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The study revealed the presence of various phytochemicals, which were confirmed by qualitative phytochemical screening, might be a reason for combustion. To detect the phytochemical presence, gas chromatography mass spectrum was also carried out (Prashanth et al., 2018). ZnO-NPs were also synthesized using the leaf extract of Ficus religiosa and A. indica (Raghavendra et al., 2017). For both plant extracts, temperature (70 C) was maintained for NPs synthesis. SEM image showed the fine nanorods of NPs. The average size of NPs\n914.3 Metal-oxide nanoparticles synthesized from various forest trees\nfrom XRD was calculated by using Scherrer’s formula. ZnO-NPs obtained from F. religiosa had an average particle size of 23 nm, while that of A. indica was 25 nm.\nIn one study, leaf extract of F. benghalensis was used for biosynthesis of ZrO2-NPs. The synthesis of ZrO2-NPs was confirmed by XRD which showed that size of NPs was 7 nm, calculated by using Scherrer’s equation. The UV vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of ZrO2-NPs showed strong absorption in the UV region around 240 350 nm due to the charge transition from oxide species to zirconium cation (O2-Zr41). EDS spectrum of synthesized ZrO2-NPs showed the presence of two elements, Zr and O. TEM investigation of synthesized NPs revealed size of NP lies between 10 and 18 nm and they were spherical in shape (Shinde et al., 2018).\nMirza et al. (2018) used leaf extracts of two tree species, namely Grewia optiva and Prunus persica, as capping and stabilizing agent for iron-oxide nanoparticles (FeO-NPs) synthesis. However, in this publication, authors have wrongly mentioned (Agrewia optiva) the name of first plant. Obtained FeO-NPs characterization was accomplished through UV vis, FTIR, SEM, TEM, XRD, and so on. SEM studies have shown the particles obtained from G. optiva were irregular clusters with rough surfaces, agglomerated, quasi-spherical, and their size varied from 15 to 60 nm, while the NP from P. persica were spherical, granular, agglomeration occurred between the outer surfaces of organic material surrounded by the FeO-NPs, and their size varied from 13 to 70 nm.\nMetal-oxide nanocomposite of Ni-Cu oxide (NiCuO), Cu-Cr oxide (CuCr2O4), and Ni-Cr oxide (NiCrO3) were prepared using leaf extract of Aegle marmelos. TEM studies have confirmed that the high crystalline bimetallic metal-oxide (BMO) were formed with a size below 50 nm and these BMO have different shapes such as nanorods of NiCuO, nanosphere of NiCrO3, and nanoflower of CuCr2O4 (Rani and Shanker, 2018). Aqueous leaf extract of Terminalia catappa was used to prepare neodimium-oxide nanoparticles (Nd2O3-NPs). FTIR studies have shown the functional groups of secondary metabolites had a role as a weak base source and capping agent in the process of Nd2O3-NPs formation, while TEM showed the particle size approximately 40 60 nm (Lembang et al., 2018). F. benghalensis prop roots extract was used to prepare silver-oxide nanoparticles (Ag2O-NPs). Effects of pH, extract concentration, metal ion concentration, and contact time were investigated for optimum production of Ag2O-NPs. UV vis study showed absorbance peak in the range of 430 nm, and FTIR peaks indicated the presence of phytochemicals with functional groups (amines, carboxylic acid, ester, amide, ether, alcohol, and phenol) in the prop root extract which were responsible for the formation of the NPs. Further, HRTEM, SAED, and XRD studies revealed the morphology (spherical), silver-oxide 42.7 nm and silver 51.4 nm, and crystalline nature of the obtained NPs, respectively. The blend of F. benghalensis prop root extract and Ag2O-NPs have shown excellent antibacterial activities against the two dental bacteria, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli sp. (Manikandan et al., 2017).\n92 CHAPTER 4 Nanomaterials from various forest tree species\nZamani et al. (2018) fabricated ceria-oxide nanoparticles (CeO2-NPs) from cerium nitrate and walnut shell as a worthless agricultural waste by a thermal decomposition method followed by open air calcination. They have reported that the particle size can be adjusted by changing cerium source/biomass ratio. Biosynthesis of SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) (by microwave heating method) using Parkia speciosa Hassk pods extract was carried out by Begum and Ahmaruzzaman (2018). They were characterized by using UV vis, XRD, EDX, TEM, HRTEM, SAED, and FTIR spectroscopy. The synthesized SnO22 QDs revealed an excellent photocatalytic activity.\nIzadiyan et al. (2018) used green husk extract of Juglan regia for iron-oxide NPs synthesis through coprecipitation procedure with J. regia extract and without it. HRTEM studies showed the mean diameter and standard deviation of ironoxide NPs and J. regia/iron-oxide NPs synthesized using coprecipitation method were 12.60 6 2.87 and 5.77 6 1.66 nm, respectively. Further, it was noticed that J. regia/iron-oxide NPs synthesized using extract had smaller size than NPs fabricated by coprecipitation procedure. In another recent study, Izadiyan et al. (2018) prepared core-shell Fe3O4/Au-NPs using an advanced procedure of twostep synthesis from J. regia green husk extract. HRTEM studies showed the mean diameter of core-shell Fe3O4/Au-NPs synthesized using coprecipitation procedure was 6.08 6 1.06 nm. Further, they found that the physical and structural features of core-shell Fe3O4/Au-NPs possess intrinsic properties of gold and magnetite. Vibrating sample magnetometer showed that the core-shell Fe3O4/Au had high saturation magnetization and low coercivity due to the magnetic properties. Overall, authors have given emphasis on the magnetic properties and anticancer activities of core-shell Fe3O4/Au-NPs. Authors have suggested that this compound can be ideal candidate for cancer treatment and other biomedical applications. Further details of metal-oxide NPs synthesis, used tree parts or chemicals/products, characterization techniques, and their applications are given in Table 4.2."

Because these particles are unique as they possess high surface area to volume ratio (small size), they are capable of penetrating the cell membranes and/or the biological barriers easily. This feature of the NPs increases the effectiveness against the tumor cells at lower concentration and then decreases toxicity to the surrounding normal cells (Husen, 2019a). Arya et al.

Arya et al. (2018) used P. juliflora bark for Ag-NPs and examined for catalytic activity in reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. Results indicated that 90% degradation was done in 80 min. Liu et al. (2017) have reported the catalytic activity of palladium NPs, and these particles were fabricated from pine needle extract. The palladium/residue of pine needle nanocomposite acts as a heterogeneous catalyst and shows superior catalytic activity for the Suzuki coupling reaction. The yield of the reaction of 4-bromotoluene with phenylboronic acid catalyzed by palladium 0.03/residue of pine needle reached 98% with low palladium loading (0.1 mmol%) at room temperature for 30 min. Moreover, Liu et al. (2017) have recommended that the catalyst could be easily separated by centrifugation and reused at least six times without significant loss of activity. Iron NPs prepared from the extract of A. lebbeck leave extract were used for the removal of crystal violet dye and Congo red (Raju et al., 2016). Ag-NPs was produced from P. juliflora bark extract and examined for catalytic activity against the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-amino phenol (Arya et al., 2018).\nConclusion\nRapid and green synthesis of NPs can be done by different precursor, including forest trees. NMs derived from forest trees are gaining reputation day by day as noticed in various investigation. Green synthesis of NPs is easy, simple, costeffective, and eco-friendly. Forest trees are important carbon sink and proved to be valuable for NPs fabrication as they possess many phytochemicals. The quality, yield, stability, shape, and size of synthesized NPs depends on numerous factors such as used methodology, type of extract and their concentration, types of reducing agents, pH of reaction solution, time of incubation, temperature, light intensity, and so on. Additionally, the fabricated NPs from the various forest tree species have shown numerous applications. Overall, since the last few years, natural products especially secondary metabolites obtained from different forest tress species have been extensively explored for their potency to synthesize the desired NPs. Further, more investigation in this area to give new insights into green synthesis, especially for the development of controlled size, shape, and stability of NPs by using secondary metabolites are required.\n99Conclusion"
