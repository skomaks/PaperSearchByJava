In most countries, agriculture is considered as the spine in the overall development of countries due to its significant role in enhancing the economic development of the country Beyrouthya (2014). To meet with the challenging growth of population, it is important to have smart, sustainable, and precision agriculture to increase the productions of crops as well as providing concrete information of tailoring soils and crops by employing various sensors into the agricultural field. Precision agriculture includes the usage of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to minimum degree for maximum production Beyrouthya (2014).\nThe sensors that have been functional so far in terms of achieving accuracy in agriculture are temperature sensors, humidity sensors, soil moisture sensors, pH sensors, light sensors, colour sensors, and bio sensors (used for detection of nutrients contents in soil) Mukhopadhyay (2014); Ravichandran (2010a).

There have been occasions where multiple sensors were brought into service to determine every parameter that affected the overall growth of crops, and web based tailored applications offered flexibility to monitor the agricultural land from any location. There is now a need to develop a more innovative and novel approach due to the rapid growth in the population, lack of crop productivity in existing technologies, unnecessary and untimely use of fertilizers and pesticides inviting health and purification expenses and incurring nutrients and toxins increments, and failure in the detection of disease and bacteria in crops at an early stage Prasad et al. (2017).\nNanotechnology has huge potential to tackle the above mentioned concerns and can be used as a useful means to meet the needs of a growing population, increase in the productivity of crops, and the detection of pathogens (bacteria, virus) at the very initial level. Nanotechnology basically employs nanomaterials, which have emerged as a huge benefit with massive prospects in the agriculture\nsector. Development of nanosensors can be utilized for sensing a wide variety of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, insecticide, pathogens, etc. toward the support of sustainable agriculture for increasing crop productivity. An innovative approach for rapid disease detection in plants, especially dealing with crop pathogens, improving the ability of plants to absorb nutrients and decreasing the practise of using conventional pesticides and herbicides, has verified that nanotechnology has enormous capability to transform the agriculture sector Mukhopadhyay (2014); Prasad et al.

In addition, it was also\nfar difficult to reduce the environmental and other resource expenses related to agricultural production by lower the nutrient losses in fertilization and the amount of spread chemicals Gruère (2012).\nThe practical implementation of microsensors in the field of agriculture have grown immensely over the past few years due to the strong advantages over available conventional sensors (macro approach) in the market. Microsensors, which are purely constructed based on semiconductor technology compared to conventional sensors, yield supplementary advantages such as they are smaller in size, lighter, easily portable, extremely energy efficient, robust and have a quick response time . These microsensors are fabricated using microfabrication methods and, compared to available macro level sensors, they exhibit low power consumption compared to standard sensors Gruère (2012)\nSince this new nanotechnology came into existence, the development and sustainable growth of agriculture has depended on this new and innovative technique Alfadul et al.

For instance, new nanowire based materials used in nanotechnology contains exceptional detection and sensing properties and it can deliver advanced sensitivity, better selectivity, and probably provides better stability at lower cost Prasad et al.

Furthermore, researchers have effectively and sensibly used nanomaterials and have managed to miniaturize biosensors to more tiny and compact devices such as nanosensors to monitor disease detection in leaves at a molecular level and are very capable of real-time analysis. In addition, the enormous progression in nanobiosensors is because of the huge scientific demand for quick, sensitive and commercially worthwhile nano-biosensor systems in important spheres such as healthcare, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. Presently, the progress of developing nanotechnology based nano-biosensors is at its infancy stage.

      "text" : "The prevailing challenges of food security, sustainability and the effect of climate change have immensely engaged researchers in exploring the field of Terahertz in depth, considering it as new source of vital improvements for the agricultural sector. In recent times, there has been significant advancements in THz applications in numerous fields such as biomedical imaging, diagnostic applications, and safety and security due to its distinctive characteristics. Some of the advancements that have been achieved from these unique features are security imaging of invisible items, atmospheric studies, processing the quality control of food, high-frequency communication, non-contact imaging for protection of paintings and manuscripts, and medical imaging for non-invasive diagnostics of dental care and skin cancer. Moreover, terahertz technology has also shown distinct advancements in exploring the molecular changes of water content (WC) in leaves due to the high sensitivity and penetration features of terahertz radiation to the absorption of water by the leaves, as shown in Figure 11.2. Jornet and Akyildiz (2011); Song et al. (2018); Zahid et al. (2018).\nDespite these aforementioned advantages and the enormous contributions of terahertz technology in various fields Zahid et al. (2018), researchers are of the view that its potential in the field of plant science\nis still considered one of the least examined research areas until now Rehn et al. (2016); Zahid et al. (2018). Nevertheless, researchers have made efforts such as monitoring and controlling of environmental systems, crop productivity enhancement, protection of crops from any pathogen attacks (Born et al., 2014), and in particular, monitoring and determining the appropriate amount of water content in plant leaves by employing various methods Rehn et al. (2016). In the past, many functional techniques have been suggested, such as infrared imaging, hyper-spectral thermal imaging and magnetic spectrum imaging, to determine the comprehensive analysis of spatial and spectral information of the water content in plant leaves Saha et al. (2012); Song et al. (2018); Zahid et al. (2018).\nAlthough there has been substantial progress achieved by utilizing these techniques, there are some limitations related to each technique and they could be enhanced further. In addition, thermal and hyper-spectral imaging are generally categorized as derivation methods, which mirror the in-depth influence triggered by the modification of water content. For instance, considering the infrared or microwave spectrum, they are either incapable of detecting minor changes in the water status in leaves or are littered with the inorganic\nsalt content of the plant, resulting in vital disturbances in the overall measurement process. Saha et al. (2012); Song et al. (2018); Zahid et al. (2018).\nIn this chapter, employing the state-of-the-art terahertz technique, the focus is primarily to introduce a preliminary analysis and to investigate the WC and presence of any pesticides in leaves in the range of 0.75 to 1.2 THz frequency using the Swissto12 system (Swissto12, 2017). It is also aimed at determining the path-loss response and the complex permittivity of leaves of fresh and drought stressed leaves. Consequently, this has led to valuable information and strong correlation is identified considering the feasibility of this novel method for examining the temporal and dehydration response in plants Zahid et al.

The purpose of the whole calibration was to avoid any measurement errors produced by the system or any other external factor. As mentioned previously, the Swissto12 system has a frequency range from 0.75 to 1.2 THz, with a thickness range from 40 m to 4 mm.

The thickness range of the leaves was found in the threshold range of the system (40 \uD835\uDF07m to 4 mm), which enabled performing experiments on them.

It was noticed that the transmission response of the leaves was distinguishable from each other, as shown in Figure 11.6. Based on the initial measurement results, it was noticed that\ndifferent leaves exhibited various attenuation and, clearly showed correlation to the amount of water content or any pesticides presence in leaves. It also occurred that variation in transmission response could be due to different thickness of leaves, and components of plant physiology. In addition, from Figure 11.6, taking all the measurement response into consideration, it can be concluded that out of six leaves, cabbage exhibits the higher amount of water content followed by pea shoot and others.\nThese observations led to significant and meaningful information to study and analyse the existence of any pesticides in the leaves with terahertz frequencies. Moreover, the results also revealed that cauliflower exhibits a lower amount of water content or the presence of any pesticides in leaves as compared to other leaves. However, it also shows a sensitive region in the frequency range from 0.75 to 0.8 THz. This significant and meaningful information can be very useful to determine the volumetric amount of water content in leaves and take proactive and timely action to water the leaves to avoid any scarcity in leaves."

It is depicted that in a certain frequency range between 0.79 Hz to 0.83 THz, as shown in Figure 11.6, a more sensitive frequency zone and precise identification of changes in water content of leaves is revealed. It was perceived that the path-loss response could be due to the distinguished surface roughness of leaves, the presence of water content in leaves and the propagation properties of leaves in the process of their growth. Comparing the results of the three leaves in Figure 11.7 it is interesting to notice that the aromatic leaf exhibit a high path-loss response compare to other leaves, i.e. sage and basil. From the figure, it can also be noticed that the least path-loss response obtained in basil compare to sage due to having some high dip in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1.1THz.\nEventually, it is revealed that there is relatively high dehydration rate or less water content in the aromatic leaf compared to other results. In addition, the results also clearly reveal the relationship between the thickness and water content of leaves. The path-loss response of leaves exhibits a strong correlation with water content and with the physical statistics of the leaves. Hence, it also highlights the information about absorption loss and reveals how much water content is absorbed by the leaves and how much is reflected back. Absorption loss can be due to surface irregularities or due to the high absorption of water content at the time of measurement."
