      "text" : "Nowadays, the widespread presence of the pharmaceutical materials in the environment created various potential adverse effects on the ecological systems and as an especial case on human life. Besides the high toxicity of more of these compounds, their presence in the aquatic environment (drinking water, surface water, groundwater, and wastewater demands) can cause to their toxicity and their potential to induce drug resistance [1e4]. Sulfasalazine or azulfidine (SZ) has been widely used for treating inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. It is a conjugated drug that includes sulfapyridine (SPD) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). These components linked by an azo bond. SZ with high persistence in the environment can cause subtle chronic and unpredicted effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystems [5].\nThe semiconducting based photocatalysis has been widely used for removing various organic/inorganic pollutants from water/wastewater samples. A complete run of this process includes the harvesting of the irradiated UV or visible photons, the excitation of semiconductor to produce the electrohole (e/h) pairs as the charge carriers, the e/h separation and their transference to the semiconductor surface, and occurring the redox reactions on its surface. Finally, some reactive species of the superoxide radicals (such as O2 ) via adsorption of the photogenerated electrons by the dissolved oxygen and hydroxyl radicals ( OH) via the oxidation of H2O/OH by the photogenerated holes can be produced during these redox processes. The attacks of the aforementioned radicals and the e/h pairs to the pollutant molecules destroy them into the smaller intermediates and finally into carbon dioxide, water, and other inorganic species. Detailed mechanisms of these processes have illustrated in detail in the literature [6e19]. Unfortunately, the recombination of e/h pairs diminishes the efficiency of this useful technique. So far doping, coupling, and supporting of semiconductors, a decrease in the size, plasmonic materials have been used to diminish the e/h recombination that has discussed sufficiently in the literature [20e40].\nHere, ZnO and NiO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and coupled to enhance its photocatalytic activity towards sulfasalazine. The work focused on the kinetic study of the effects of the experimental variables. Finally, the effect of the reaction temperature on the photocatalytic activity was studied and by using the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy and the thermodynamics factors (DG, DH, and DS) of the SZ photodegradation process was evaluated. Generally,\nless attention has paid on the thermodynamic aspect of the heterogeneous photodegradation process in the published works, and thuswe encouraged to evaluate it. Aswe know, the charge carriers’ separation in a coupled semiconductor system is due to the internal redox processes occurred between the involved semiconductors. Thus, the selection of the suitable semiconductors that have the suitable potential positions of the valence (VB) and conduction bands (CB) favors these redox processes and gives the highest e/h separation in the coupled system. Thus, NiO and ZnO were selected for the construction of a suitable composite in this work."

      "text" : "As we know, the powder XRD patterns are useful tools to study the structure of the crystalline compounds [43]. Fig. 1A shows the diffraction patterns for the as-prepared NiO and ZnO NPs and the resulted NiO/ZnO composite. The patterns comprised with the standard patterns and a good agreement was observed for NiO with the standard face-centered-cubic\nNiO at 2W positions of 37.30 (111), 43.20 (200), 44.60 (200), 51.90 (220), 62.90 (311), and 76.30 (222) based on JCPDS: 78- 0429 [44]. The effect of the calcination temperature on the crystallite phases of NiO has illustrated in our previous work [45]. The peak appeared at a 2q position of 43.3 (200) belongs to the metallic Ni [46]. Besides, the ZnO pattern agreed with the standard pattern of hexagonal crystallite type ZnO at 2q positions of 31.60 (100), 34.33 (002), 36.20 (101), 47.40 (102), 56.50 (110), 62.70 (103), 66.30 (200), 67.70 (112), 69.10 (201), 72.60 (004), and 76.80 (202) based on JCPDS: 21-1486 [47]. As shown, all the above-mentioned peaks have appeared in the spectrum of the composite. Based on these comparisons, all XRD peaks assigned to the corresponding hkl planes.\nThe effect of the crystallite size on the peak broadening was evaluated by the Scherrer equation (Eq. (2)) [48] and the simultaneous effects of the size and the strain were evaluated by the Williamson-Hall (W-H) equation (Eq. (3)) [49e51]. In these equations, l shows the applied x-ray wavelength (commonly CuKa: 1.5406 A), b shows the line broadening at half of the maximum intensity (FWHM, in radians) and q shows the Bragg angle. The term d shows the crystallite size and the 0.9 value commonly considered as the Scherrer constant. As shown, the W-H equation included by both the crystallite size effect (the Scherrer equation) and the strain effect (h). When h reaches zero, the W-H equation gives the Scherrer equation.\nd ¼ 0.9l/b cos(q) (2)\nbcos(q) ¼ (0.9l/d) þ (h sin(q)) (3)\nBy using the peak broadening in the Scherrer equation, the average crystallite values of about 33.5, 33.8, and 39.8 nmwere estimated for the NiO, ZnO, and the coupled photocatalyst, respectively. All data, information, and the results are collected in SDT2.\nIn the W-H equation, the crystallite size varies as 1/cos(q) and the strain by tan(q) from the peak width. By using the intercept of bcos(q) - sin(q) plots, the averages crystallite size of about 6.7, 36.7, and 29.5 nm were obtained for the NiO, ZnO, and ZnO/NiO samples, respectively. All data, information, and the results are collected in SDT3.\nFor the samples with the grain sizes below 100 nm, more precise crystallite sizes could be estimated by the Scherrer equation. But, when the mechanical force used for the preparation of the sample, some strain can be induced to the sample by the appliedmechanical force which can change the d-spacing of the prepared sample. Based on the Braggs’ law (nl ¼ 2dsinq), the induced d-fluctuation can disturb the qvalue. In this case, the W-H model is useful to estimate the grain size of the sample [52]. In the wet chemical synthesis of nanoparticles, the flocculation and aggregation of the resulted solid NPS can be done due to the high effective surface area of the NPs. One way to reduce this effect is the addition of some surfactants to the reaction cell. After the synthesis process, the mechanical grinding of the resulted NPs can reduce the particle size and separate the aggregated species. For\npreparing the NiO/ZnO NC, the NiO-ZnO mixture was throughly hand mixed for 15 min. During this process, some strains may be induced to the sample because of the applied mechanical force. The smaller crystallite size of NiO NPs by theWeHmodel is due to this applied force. On the other hand, the appliedmechanical force to the NiO NPs is higher than the other samples, and this force induced a higher strain to NiO. Thus, the W-H model is a better model to estimate the crystallite size of NiO. A higher crystallite size value of NiO by the Scherrer equation can be related to the in-correct model used for the estimation of NiO NPs."

As shown in Fig. 2A, the composite includes a mixedmorphology containing the nano-sheets and semi-spherical NPs. This morphology was also confirmed by other images with larger magnifications. The results confirm that more particles have a nano-dimension.\nThe elemental analysis of the composite was also followed by the EDX analysis and the results are shown in Fig. 2E (and in SDT4). The appearance of the peaks of the constituent\nelements of Zn, Ni, and O of the composite confirms the high purity of the synthesized composite. Quantitative EDX results show the weigh percent of 15.88, 61.68, and 22.44% for O, Ni, and Zn elements (correspond to the atomic% of 41.60, 44.02, and 14.38%), respectively. The results show that the moles of NiO in the composite is about 3.1 times greater than that of ZnO. The difference between this value and the desired ZnO:NiOmole ratio of 1:4 is due to the spot test nature and the semi-quantitative property of EDX analysis [54]. The X-ray mapping results are also shown in SDF4, confirming that all elements are homogeneously dispersed through the composite."

      "text" : "Knowing about the charges accumulated on the surface of the catalyst/adsorbent help us the optimize acidity of the solution to achieve the best signal, because a typical catalytic process takes place on the surface of the catalyst and its surface charge and the pH of the surrounding solution play the important roles on the catalytic yield. Thus, the pHpzc of the single and combined ZnO and NiO semiconductors was determined. The method for this goal was described in our previous work [64]. Two types of plots [64] were constructed to estimate the pHpzc of the samples which of results are shown in Fig. 3BeC. Generally, before the pHpzc, the catalyst surface has a negative charge (or a basic property) that capable to adsorb the protons of the water dissociation process from the adjacent solution and thus due to the leaving of hydroxyl anions in the adjacent solution its pH increases and the catalyst surface gets a positive charge. For example, the initial pHs of 2.5, 4, 6, and 8 changed to 7.96, 8.17, 8.14, and 8.48 for the NiO NPs, respectively. At pHs> pHpzc, the catalyst surface has a positive charge (or an acidic property) that adsorbs the hydroxyl anions of the water dissociation process in the adjacent solution. This process results in getting a net negative charge by the catalyst surface and a decrease in the pH of the contacted solution. Thus, the initial pHs of 10 and 11.5 changed to 9.75 and 11 for the NiO sample, respectively. At pHpzc, the initial basic property of the surface begins to change to the acidic property and in the pHpzc point sum of charges accumulated on the surface was neutralized by the surrounding solution and thus its surface has a net zero charge [64]. The pHpzc of the samples were mentioned in Fig. 3BeC that will be used in the next section to illustrate the effects of pH on the photodegradation efficiency.\nUVeVisible DRS spectra The optical properties of the samples were studied by using the UVeVis diffuse reflectance spectr-oscopy (DRS) which their typical absorption and reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 4A and SDF5 A. By extrapolating the absorption spectra towards the X-axis, the absorption edge wavelengths (l) of the samples were estimated as 355, 388, and 410 nm for the NiO, ZnO, and ZnOeNiO samples, respectively. These values were substituted in Eg (eV) ¼ 1240/l (nm) formula to estimate the band gap energy (Eg) of the samples [65,66].

In a typical Tauc plot, the plot of (ahn)1/n versus hn (the photo energy) should be drawn. Depends on the type of the electronic transition, n gets different values of 1/2 and 2 for the direct and indirect allowed transitions, and also 3 and 3/2 for the direct forbidden and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively. The typical Tauc plot for the allowed direct transition is presented in Fig. 4B and others in SDF5 B-D. By the extrapolation of the plots towards the X-axis, the band gap values of the sampleswere estimated that are summarized in Table 1. Based on the results, the coupling process enhanced the optical band gap of the NiO and relatively the ZnO NPs, and a relative red shift was observed in the band gap energy of the coupled ZnO/NiO sample with respect to the single systems.\nIn the next step, the potential positions of the VB and CB levels (EVB and ECB) were estimated by using Eqs.

      "text" : "Confirm the boosted catalytic activity of the composite Change in the UVeVis spectra of SZ solution during the different removal process is shown in Fig. 5A. Based on the results, the surface adsorption (by the composite) removed 7% SZ molecules after 40 min. It is worth mentioning that after 10 min no considerable change was observed in the surface adsorption efficiency (the results not shown) and thus before the irradiation process, all suspensions were shaken at dark for 15 min. Direct photolysis increased the absorption intensity and thus all photodegradation efficiencies compared against this solution and in parallel of each photocatalytic run, an SZ solution without the catalyst was irradiated for comparison. The increased absorbance of SZ during the UV irradiation has related to the increased resonance between the SZ isomers in the presence of UV photons that increases the molar absorptivity of SZ (see Fig. 5B) [72].\nThe boosted photocatalytic effect of the composite can be related to the matched potential positions of the VB and CB levels of the involved semiconductors. As shown in Fig. 5C, the photogenerated electrons in the NiO-CB have more negative potential than the ZnO-CB and then they can easily migrate to the ZnO-CB level. In contrast, the hole transfer can occur between the VB levels in the opposite trend. Due to this boosted effect of the composite, the effect of change in the mole ratio of the components in the composite on the photodegradation activity was followed. The results are shown in Fig. 5D. On the other hand, a matched mole ratio between the coupled semiconductors needs to achieve the\nhighest charge separation. As shown the ZnO:NiO mole ratios of 1:4 and 1:5 showed the highest photocatalytic activities. Thus, the catalyst with a mole ratio of 1:4 was selected for the next steps."

Some variables were studied kinetically by applying the Hinshelwood model on the results and typical plots of ln(C/Co) versus time were constructed to obtain the rate constant, k. This kinetic model has illustrated in detail in the literature [73]. Fig. 6A shows the effect of the dose of the composite on the SZ degradation. The rate constants as the function of the catalyst dose were obtained from the slopes of the linear curves (Inset of the figure) and summarized in Table 2. The results show an increase in the rate when the amount of the catalyst was increased from 0.2 to 0.7 g/L (k from 0.0089 to 0.03 min 1) and thereafter decrease in the rate was observed. The increase in the rate is due to available more active sites of the catalyst when its dose was increased. The decrease in higher dosages is due to agglomeration and light scattering effects which have illustrated in detail in the literature [74]. Thus, the dose of 0.7 g/L was selected for the next experiments.\nAs shown in Fig. 6B and Table 2, with an increase in the CSZ from 1 to 7 mg/L, the SZ photodegradation rate was increased, because of the collision probability between the SZ molecules and the hydroxyl radicals or other reactive species was increased. These radicals have a very short lifetime about a\nfew nano-seconds and thus they should rapidly react with the adjacent species present in the media [74]. At a high concentration of the pollutant, the screening effect of SZ molecules decreases the photoexcitation of the catalyst and thus the degradation rate was decreased [74]. Thus, the SZ solution with a concentration of 0.7 g/L was selected for the next experiments.\nThe effects of initial pH of SZ solution on the degradation efficiency are shown in Fig. 7A which shows the best degradation extent of SZ at pH 6.5. As shown in Fig. 7B, the acidic property of SZ can be illustrated by pKa values of 2.5, 6.5, and 11.0 belong to the carboxylic acid, sulfonamide and the phenolic functional groups’ protons, respectively [75,76]. Besides, as mentioned in Section Estimation of pHPZC, the used\nZnOeNiO has a pHpzc of 7.6. At pHs<7.6, the surface of the catalyst has positively charged that repels the protonated SZ molecules. As pH begins to increase, some protonated functional groups such as the sulfonamide group tend to deprotonate and the decrease in the mentioned repulsive force increases the degradation efficiency until pH 6.5. In this way, the density of the positive charge on the catalyst surface was also decreased. At pHs> pHpzc (7.6), more of the functional groups are deprotonated and the repulsive force between the anionic functional groups or their free electronic pairs and the negatively charged catalyst repels SZ species and the degradation efficiency tends to decrease [77].\nComparison of the photodegradation and mineralization rates Some photodegradation experiments were done in the selected irradiation times ranged from 0 to 30 min and based on the recorded absorbencies, the typical Hinshelwood plot was constructed as shown in Fig. 8A. The slope of the curve is equal to 0.0904 min 1 which shows the apparent-first order rate constant, k, for the SZ photodegradation. This k-value corresponds to t1/2 ¼ 7.66 min, which means that half of a 7mg/L SZ solution can be degraded by the photocatalyst in the applied conditions during 7.66 min.\nTo evaluate the mineralization extent of the mentioned photodegraded solutions, the resulted solutions were subjected to the chemical oxygen demand (COD) experiment. The remaining COD values are depicted in Fig. 8B which shows the decrease in the COD of the SZ solution during the photodegradation process. The inset of this figure shows the Hinshelwood plot obtained from the COD results. The slope of this curve is about 0.0915 min 1 which shows the rate constant of the SZ mineralization that to t1/2 ¼ 7.57 min. The comparison of the results shows that both mineralization and photodegradation processes of SZ have the same rate and the photodegraded SZ molecules or its degradation intermediates can be rapidlymineralized to water, carbon dioxide, and other sulfur and nitrogen contained inorganic species. No attempt was done on detecting the degradation products in this step. The SZ photodegradation intermediates by Cu2O/CdS composite have illustrated in our previous work [78].\nEffect of temperature and activation energy The effect of change in temperature of the reaction cell on the SZ photocatalytic degradation by the ZnOeNiO nanocomposite was studied in the temperature range of 15e55 C. The change in the degradation efficiency as a function of reaction temperatures during the time interval of 5e30 min is shown in Fig. 9A. Typical Hinshelwood plots are also shown in Fig. 9B to evaluate the change in the rate constants as a function of the reaction temperature. The obtained rate constants are summarized in Table 2. As the results show,with an increase in the reaction temperature the rate of the SZ photodegradation was increased due to an increase in the collision frequency (probability) between the SZ molecules or its degradation intermediateswith the catalyst surfacewhere the reactive hydroxyl radicals produced.\nBased on the Arrhenius law (Eq. (7)), the rate constant k directly depends on the frequency factor A, and thus when\ntemperature increased the collision factor (frequency factor) and the degradation rate were increased. Also, k-value depends on the activation energy (Ea) and temperature (T) with an exponential relationship confirming the most important roles of these factors on the rate of the reaction. Based on Eq. (7), a decrease in the Ea-value, and an increase in the T-value increase the reaction rate constant. The enhancement of the photooxidation with the increase in temperature confirms that the collision probability plays a vital role on the enhancement of the photodegradation yield and the irradiation process is the primary source for the production of e /hþ pairs at the ambient temperature because the Eg is too high to be overcome by thermal excitation [79,80].\nk ¼ Ae Ea/RT (7)\nTo estimate the activation energy of the SZ photodegradation, the linear form of the Arrhenius equation was used as shown in Eq. (8).\nln k ¼ ln A e (Ea/RT) (8)\nBased on the obtained k-values from the plots in Fig. 9B, typical Arrhenius plot of ln k versus 1/T was constructed as shown in Fig. 9C. From the intercept of the curve, an A-value of 2.131 104 min 1 was obtained. The activation energy of the SZ photodegradation process was estimated about 15.87 kJ/mol from the slope of the curve. This activation\nenergy seems to be enough law to provide an efficient photocatalyst for SZ photodegradation at a fast rate. For example, Ea-values of 73.2 kJ/mol (5-37 C) and 84.5 kJ/mol (50-80 C) have reported for the degradation of anthocyanins [81]. For the degradation of rhodamine B dye by the ZnO photocatalyst, activation energy of 32.3 kJ/mol has also reported [80].\nTo estimate the thermodynamic data for the SZ photodegradation process, the enthalpy change was calculated from the obtained Ea-value by the following equation, supposing that 1 mol of SZ molecules was degraded.\nDH* ¼ Ea þ RT (9)\nThen the following equation was used to estimate the entropy change of the reaction, in which KB and h show the Boltzmann and the Plank constants, respectively.\nln (k/T) ¼ ln (KB/h) þ (DS*/R) e (DH*/RT) (10)\nThus, the plot of ln (k/T) versus (DH*/RT) was constructed (Fig. 9D) and from its intercept, the value of DS* was calculated. Then, the activation Gibbs free energy was estimated by the following equation [82].\nDG* ¼ DH* e TDS* (11)\nAll data are summarized in Table 3. As shown, the SZ photodegradation by the proposed ZnOeNiO photocatalyst\naccompanied by a relatively high positive activation enthalpy and the Gibbs free energy values, indicating that a highly hydrated transition state complex was produced. These positive values also confirmed that for reaching this transition state complex needs enough energy and it cannot produce at ambient conditions. A negative entropy, 0.22 kJ/mol, (which is near zero and is also relatively positive) shows that the activated complex was not much ordered than the reactants. On the other hand, the weak bonds are present in the activated complex which favors the conditions for the rapid degradation of SZ molecules into the degradation products [82]."

      "heading" : "Reusability of the catalyst",
      "text" : "The reusability of the composite in four successive photodegradation runs was also examined which of results are shown in Fig. 10. Before each run, the reused catalyst was dried at 100 C for 30 min to remove the adsorbed species and to obtain a re-new surface. The degradation efficiencies in each run were averaged based on triplicate measurements as 88.8 ± 1.96, 87.1 ± 2.32, 88.1 ± 2.84, and 85.4 ± 3.14, for the first to fourth runs, respectively. As shown, the reused catalyst showed a good activity after the fourth re-using run and no considerable decrease in its activity was observed, so its initial\nactivity of 88.8% changed to 85.4% after the fourth run. To statistical confirmation of the stability of the catalyst, the difference between the initial and final averages was compared by the statistical t-test. For this goal, the pooled standard deviation of 2.14 was calculated for the results obtained in the first and the fourth runs and a t-value of 1.59 was obtained, which is smaller than the critical value of t0.05,4 ¼ 2.78. Besides, the g-test was used by comparing the standard deviations obtained for each run compared [83]. The experimental g-value of 0.3632 was obtained which is smaller than the critical g-value of g0.05, 3, 4 ¼ 1.14 (for the 4 class compared with the triplicate measurements) in a 95% confidence interval. On the other hand, there is no significant difference between the changes in the degradation efficiencies of the composite during these reusing runs and all changes are due to random errors at 95% confidence interval [83].\nTable 3 e Kinetics and thermodynamic parameters for the photocatalytic degradation of SZ by NiOeZnO NC.\nT (K) k (min 1) Ea (kJ/ mol)\nDHo (kJ/ mol)\nDSo (kJ/ mol)\nDGo (kJ/ mol)\n288 0.0289 15.87 13.47 0.22 76.83 293 0.0290 13.43 77.89 298 0.0316 13.39 78.95 303 0.0415 13.35 80.01 310 0.0469 13.29 81.49 318 0.0503 13.22 83.18 328 0.0610 13.14 85.30\nComparison of the work with some published works For comparison, some previously published works on the photocatalytic activities of the NiO and ZnO NPs, and also some reported works on the SZ photodegradation are summarized in Table 4 [13e19,24,25,29,84e89]. We believe that each of the mentioned works in Table 4 has its novelty and advantage, but some of the used synthesis techniques need expensive materials/instruments. In the present work, the used NiOeZnO NC was prepared by the simple grinding methodwhich decreases the overall cost of themethod. Based on our literature survey, there are a few works in the SZ photodegradation and thus introducing the novel works for the SZ photodegradation may have great importance. As shown in Table 4, and in general, most of the published works focused on dyes’ photodegradation, especially on methylene\nblue and methyl orange. Thus, paying attention to the photodegradation of other chemicals is important in the environmental point of view."

      "heading" : "Conclusion",
      "text" : "The increased photoactivity of the coupled ZnOeNiO nanocomposite (NC) was observed towards SZ which can be related to the better charge separation in the composite with respect to the individual NiO and ZnO NPs. Change in the crystallite size (about of 6.7, 36.7, and 29.5 nm for NiO, ZnO and ZnO/NiO samples by the Williamson-Hall equation, and about of 33.5, 33.8, and 39.8 nmby the Scherrer equation, respectively) shows the effect of both size and peak broadening effects in the diffraction peaks. The EDX analysis showed a NiO:ZnO ratio of 3.1 which is near the desired value of 4:1. The difference between the values is related to the spot test and the semiquantitative properties of the EDX analysis. The band gap energies of 3.49, 3.19, and 3.02 eVwere estimated for theNiO, ZnO, and ZnOeNiO samples by using the absorption edge wavelength, respectively. These show an enhancement in the optical properties of the NC sample with respect to both the individual NPs, especially the NiO NPs. The best photocatalytic activity was obtained at pH 6.5 (near the pHpzc: 7.6) confirming that both charged SZ species and the charges accumulated on the catalyst surface have the vital roles on the SZ photodegradation. The close rate constants of 0.0904 min 1 (t1/ 2 ¼ 7.66 min) and 0.0915 min 1 (t1/2 ¼ 7.57 min) for the SZ photodegradation and the SZ mineralization processes, respectively, confirm that the SZ molecules and its photodegradation intermediates can be rapidly mineralized to water, carbon dioxide, and other sulfur and nitrogen contained inorganic species. The frequency factor of 2.131 104min 1 and the activation energy of 15.87 kJ/mol were obtained for the process by the Arrhenius equation, confirming the need of relative low activation energy for the SZ photodegradation process. The enhancement in the photooxidation with the increase in the reaction temperature confirms that the collision probability plays a vital role on enhancing the photodegradation yield and the irradiation process is the primary source for the production of e /hþ pairs at the ambient temperature because the Eg is too\nhigh to be overcome by the thermal excitation. The positive DH and DG values confirm a highly hydrated transition state complex was produced. A negative entropy, 0.22 kJ/mol, (which is near zero and is also relatively positive) shows that the activated complex was not much ordered than the reactants which favors the rapid degradation of the SZmolecules into the degradation products."
