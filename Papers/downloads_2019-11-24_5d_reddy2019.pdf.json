      "heading" : "Introduction",
      "text" : "Hydrogen (H2) production is premeditated as an ideal solution for increasing the global energy demands. In particular, the photocatalytic splitting of water with the help of natural sunlight offers a promising strategy to provide a clean and eco-friendly production of H2. Fujishima and Honda [1] demonstrated for the first time in 1972 that a photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is capable of splitting water molecule into H2 and O2 using TiO2 thin film photo-electrode in the presence of an external bias. Later, the requirement of an external bias in PECmethod led Bard in 1979 to show that in the existence of a sacrificial reagent (SR), the splitting of water by a powdered TiO2 catalyst can be done without any bias under sunlight [2].\nThe semiconductor harvest light with energy greater than its band gap in-turn electrons get excited from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) leads to electron-hole pair\ngeneration as first step of the photocatalytic process [3]. For water splitting, the separation and migration of electrons as well as holes into the surface of the photocatalyst where holes oxidize H2O into H þ and O2 gas, simultaneously electrons reduces Hþ to H2 gas [4], as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, the band edge potential of the semiconductor with VB should be more positive than water oxidation potential (>þ 1.23 eV) whereas CB edge is more negative than water reduction potential (>-0.01). However, significant challenges faced in this process are electron-hole recombination, the large band gap of photocatalyst and formation of H2O form H2 and O2 (back reaction). Over the later decades, several attempts to address these critical issues have been proposed, such as noble metal loading such as either co-catalysts (Pt, Pd) [5e7] for effective utilization of excited charge carriers from the semiconductor catalysts for improved activity or sensitizers (Ag, Au) [8,9] to inject the electrons into the CB of the semiconductor for catalytic H2 evolution through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The elemental doping like N, C [10,11] for visible active photocatalysts to utilize more photons and composite semiconductors like Ag2OeTiO2 [12], Cu2OeTiO2 [13], Bi2O3eTiO2 [14] for synergetic effect to minimize the charge carrier recombination compared to pristine materials, dye sensitization [15], solid solutions like GaNeZnO [16], and core/shell nanostructures like RheCr2O3 as co-catalysts [17e21].\nFig. 2 shows the synergetic effect of the composite photocatalysts compared to their pristine materials in improving the photocatalytic activity by many folds. Fig. 2(a) shows the co-catalytic role of Pd deposited on TiO2 nanosheets, here the charge transfer enhanced mechanism was explained for improved H2 evolution under UV light irradiation [7]. Fig. 2(b) explains sensitizing role of Au deposited on TiO2 nanoparticles through LSPR effect for improved activity by controlling Au particle size [22]. Here the small Au NPs-TiO2 (Au ¼ 4.4 nm) composite showed 20 times higher activity than\nlarge AueTiO2 (Au ¼ 67 nm). Fig. 2(c) depicts the band gap reduction of Ba5Ta4O15 through N doping for enhanced photocatalytic activity [23]. Fig. 2(d) shows the Bi2O3eTiO2 nanostructured composite for H2 generation under solar light irradiation, here the composite performed 6.1 and 10 folds higher activity than pristine TiO2 nanostructure and TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively [14]. These results imply that the nanocomposite photocatalysts with metals or metal oxides can improve their performance for H2 generation.\nFig. 3 displays the illustrations of mechanistic aspects of different photocatalysts used for hydrogen generation. Recently, Tiwari et al. [24] (Fig. 3(a)). studied the H2 production process over the tetrathiafulvalene based dye-sensitized TiO2 photocatalyst under solar light irradiation, the composite materials showed enhanced activity compare to pristine TiO2 due to absorption of visible light by dye and electrons injected into conduction band of TiO2 for reduction reaction. Maeda et al. [25] highlighted GaN:ZnS solid solution based catalysts for overall water splitting under solar light irradiation (Fig. 3(b)). Fig. 3(c) shows the H2 generation process and charge carriers excitation in CdSeZnS core-shell particles, here the CdSeZnS coreeshell photocatalyst shows a 169 and 56 times higher average H2 evolution rate (792 mmol h 1 g 1) than ZnS (4.7 mmol h 1 g 1) and CdS (14.1 mmol h 1 g 1), respectively [26].\nFig. 3(d) displays the H2 generation process from CuOeCr2O3 core-shell as co-catalyst deposited on TiO2, here the photoelectrons from TiO2 migrates to CuOeCr2O3 co-catalyst that facilitates the electron capture and existing active sites facilitates adsorption of Hþ thereby instantaneously undergoes reduction reaction for H2 production [27].\nThe ever-increasing interest in nanostructured metal oxides is owing to their bulky surface area, diminutive distribution length and short reflective nature. A number of metal oxides with wide band gap, which limits their activity in the visible region [28]. The photo-generated electron-hole pair diffused to the surface and their participation in this process is possible when there is trapping of charge carries by reactants. As a result, the photocatalytic performance has remarkably enhanced at smaller dimensions [4]. The research on preparation of nanostructured photocatalysts has thus become requisite to meet the future requirements of energy. These nano-dimensions enable proficient compilation of charge carriers, leading to amplify the overall efficiency [29]. Fig. 4(a) shows how the charge carrier recombination (bulk and surface) can be minimized through co-catalyst deposited with more number of active sites and Fig. 4(b) explains the morphology dependent properties of the 0-D bulk material and 1-D nanostructured materials. Here the 0-D particle\nundergo fast recombination of electron-hole pairs (e þ hþ) both in bulk and surface of the material and thus the catalytic efficiency was low unlike in 1-D nanostructure, which was effectively minimized the charge carriers recombination through quantum confinement (unidirectional flow of electrons in nano dimension), thus the photocatalytic efficiency was improved accordingly [30,31].\nNoble metal-loaded metal oxide photocatalysts\nNano-size noble metal have gained great consideration in the recent past given their outstanding physicochemical characteristics, suggesting their broad applicability in industrial arena [32e34]. Noble metal nanoparticles such as Pt, Ag, Pd, Au, Rh, and Ru have been highly effective for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiencies through LSPR effect and schottky junction [7,35e37]. However, noble metal nanoparticles tend to spontaneously aggregate into larger particles, which leads to a reduction in their surface energy, lifetime and efficiency, but their high cost limits their practical usage. The rapid growth of new industries has twisted critical need for developing strong, facile as well as reproducible synthetic roadmap for active, steady and eco-friendly nanomaterials.\nThe catalysis by itself is a rapidly expanding field to meet the growing demand for high-performance catalysts having exceptional stability and selectivity. Thus, catalysis has been making rapid advances with a great promise for nanoscience and nanotechnology [38]. The amplification of catalytic actions of noble metals puts them on top of the substrate containing active centres [39,40]. Any such an opposite substrate provides an elevated exterior area for stabilization of tiny nanoparticles (NPs) but also forms the hybrid intersection with rich redox centres on the two-phase interface. In this aspect, Zhang et al. [41], reported the fundamental aspects and physico-chemical properties of plasmonic photocatalysts and theirmajor beneficial effects as displayed in Fig. 5. But it is not elaborated more on photocatalytic H2 generation applications. Hence in this review, we focused on importance of plasmonic materials on photocatalysis.\nSynthetic protocols for noble metal and metal oxide-based nanocomposites (NM-MOs)\nAmongst the diversity in developed nanocatalysts, single nanostructures containing integrated noble metals (e.g., Au, Pt, Ag, Rh, and Pd) into metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO) have recently become the hot topic in research area. These nanostructures not only coalesces the functionality of individual nanoparticles (NPs) but also possesses the distinctive, combined and synergetic catalytic effects in comparison with single-component catalysts. The metal oxide-doped noble metal nanocomposites are synthesized using a variety of protocols including impregnation [42], co-precipitation [43,44], deposition-precipitation [45]. To fabricate high-performance catalysts, several strategic methods have been developed. These are classified into four categories: (a) confining of noble metal NPs into porous supports [46,47]; (b) modification of supports [48]; (c) use of alloy NPs in place of single noble metal NPs [49], and (d) enclosing noble metal NPs into chains having\ncore-shell structure [50]. Different synthetic methods for the preparation of NM-MOs are briefly discussed in the following sections."

      "text" : "In the developedmethod, upon exposure of TiO2 or ZnO to UVlight, the absorbed light generates photoelectrons and holes for spontaneous red-ox reactions at surface. Here, metal cations present in the solution accepts photo electrons to metallic NPs, which concurrently get adhere onto the surface of TiO2 or ZnO. To achieve this, alcohol is necessary to inhibit the growth of positive charges during photo-deposition. To put together adsorption of metal ions on the surfaces, metal oxide nanostructures are dispersed in metal salt solution for some instance. The suspension is then illuminated with a light of appropriate intensity, which results in the authentication of metal NPs onto the metal oxide surface. In this method, the intensity of the light is important since the increase in intensity leads to a decrease in the average particle size [51]. Fig. 6(a) shows the synthetic pathway for Pt NPs deposition onto TiO2 nanotubes surface [52] by photodeposition technique. Also, the concentration of metal precursor can significantly influence the particle size of the NM to be deposited onto MO surface. A lower concentration of metal precursor then leads to smaller particles, but higher concentration might cause bigger particle size of NM."

      "text" : "According to the earlier investigations, the present technique is effortless that encompasses chemical reduction of the adsorbed metal precursor on the metal oxide exterior. It may bementioned here that chemical reduction ofmetal precursor requires much care. Reducing agent employed in the process should be carefully chosen considering that desorption of reduced metal may not happen from the surface of the metal\noxide. For the preparation of NM NPs (Pt, Au), several reliable methods are available, among which citrate reduction (Turkevich method), reduction by NaBH4 and Brust technique is the facile and straightforward practice to deposit NPs onto metal oxide surface. Another approach used involves presynthesized Pt NPs-adsorbed onto the exterior of the support by adding colloidal Pt4þ solution to the metal oxide suspension under mild stirring [53e55].\nLakshmana reddy et al. [52] reported the chemical reduction method for deposition of Pt NPs on TiO2 nanotubes by using NaBH4 as reducing agent as shown in Fig. 6(b). However, the limitation of this method is an aggregation of metal NPs adsorption, which reduces the efficiency of nanostructure for most wanted relevance. Anchoring of Pt NPs on top of the surface modified semiconductors via linker molecules was also carried out that led to prevent aggregation or coalescence of Pt NPs onto metal oxide surface [56]. On the other hand, polyol process seems to be a highly convincing approach for Ag NP preparation, since ethylene glycol (EG) serves as a reducing agent, while Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the preservative. In a typical synthetic process [57], by stirring EG is heated to 160 C followed by adding PVP and AgNO3."

      "heading" : "Precipitation method",
      "text" : "Catalytically activemetal NPs can be obtained by precipitation method. For example, to Au precursor solution, pre-grown\nMOs are dispersed, such as HAuCl4 resulting in the formation of a precipitate, which can be further calcined to obtain Au NPs. Here, pH of the dispersion is a key feature to determine the structure and characteristics of the obtained NMeMOs. Moreau et al. [58] suggested that Au/TiO2 catalysts obtained from precipitation method carried out at pH 9 exhibited most exceptional catalytic actions, where the negative surface charge of TiO2 support makes it inauspicious for the authentication of chlorine ligands, which is disadvantage for its catalytic features [59]. According to Tran et al. [60], pH of the final suspension forcibly affects the size of Au NPs, chlorine removal competence, Au deposition yield and mostly catalytic actions.\nAs a whole, precipitating agent has an influence. Sodium hydroxide is generally employed as a precipitating agent for this purpose where the size of Au NPs can be tuned by changing the calcination temperature and pH of the solution, but the use of NaOH poses a limitation in not depositing all the Au NPs onto MO surface. Higher loading of Au NPs onto MOs was observed by using urea as the precipitating agent [61,62]. Formation of Au NPs of sizes <10 nm with a well-defined coupling with the support are some of the advantages of this method. The Au NPs decorated onto the MOs surface significantly enhanced the number of the lively position for adherence of reactants during active catalytic phenomena. A distinct union between the two\ncomponents leads to partition between photo-generated electrons."

      "heading" : "Hydrothermal method",
      "text" : "The method is mainly employed for the preparation of coreshell type nanostructured materials. This is a very simple and economically viable process, which works at low temperatures. In the hydrothermal process, the mixture of metal precursor and metal oxide precursors are thermally treated in an autoclave above the boiling temperature of water. In the entire method, reduction and adsorption of MOs surface are focused [63]. A similar protocol is employed for solvo-thermal method where aqueous medium is substituted by an opposite solvent. Even though the methods are easy and fast, metal NPs obtained by these methods are prone for aggregation.\nA variety of oxo-hydroxo species having enhanced thermal steadiness, pure oxides having a hierarchical arrangement as well as noble metal incorporated composite materials have been successfully prepared by an easy and straightforward modified hydrothermal (MHT) process performed in a sealed wooden box fitted with an electric bulb [64]. In this method, the reaction temperature and time can significantly alter the final structures of the catalysts. Also, the shell thickness and core diameter can be altered by varying the respective precursor concentration. Sun et al. [65] investigated the consequence of shell width and core diameter of Au@TiO2 yolk-shell NPs on their photocatalytic proceedings regarding the deprivation of RhB dye by varying the precursor concentrations (Fig. 7). It was observed that small sized cavity, thin nature of TiO2 shell, and average Au NPs diameter contributed to more proficient photocatalysis. The Au@TiO2 yolk-shell NPs with a cavity diameter of 121 nm, the shell thickness of 26 nm and Au with a core diameter of 50 nm have shown a considerably high photocatalytic activity.\nNoble metal-metal oxide hybrid materials for photocatalytic hydrogen generation\nThe competence to tune charge-transfer processes of catalysts is linked to driving the proton reduction for hydrogen generation. To attain considerably high hydrogen evolution rates, the excited charge carriers (electrons and holes) must migrate from immensity to the surface of catalysts with a low possibility for getting recombined. In general, transitionmetal oxide materials (TMOs) are photo-chemically durable. Titania (TiO2) has been extensively explored for its utilization in the photocatalytic splitting of water because of its favourable band-edge locations, reliability, and low cost.\nFujishima and Honda in 1972 [1], examined the use of TiO2 as photo-anode and Pt as a cathode for the splitting of water. Later, plentiful articles were published based on water splitting describing >100 diverse novel catalysts as well as multicomponent oxides, sulfides, carbides, and nitrides. However, low production in H2 was observed due to band gap limitation of photocatalysts. To overcome this concern, photocatalysts surface was modified via elemental doping, metal ion implantation, and sensitization. Among them, noble metal deposition was found to be a convenient approach for effective utilization of charge carriers. Enhancement in the photocatalytic activity was due to the separation between photogenerated electrons and holes, as well as inhibition of back reaction betweenO2 and H2 because of the adsorption of noble metals onto the semiconductor surface. When metal oxides are coupled with noble metal NPs, their light absorption range can be extended up to visible region due to LSPR result. Besides, the creation of Schottky barrier significantly suppressed the recombination of photo-excited charge carriers [17].\nBased on the classification, the noblemetals can be used as either sensitizer or co-catalyst, but most of the noble metals can act as a co-catalytic role to trap the excited electrons from semiconductor photocatalyst. Only a few can act as a\nolk-shell NPs. TEM images of Au@TiO2 yolk-shell NPs with\nom Ref. [65] (Copyright 2017 Royal Society of Chemistry).\nsensitizer like Ag or Au, due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and inject electrons into the semiconductor catalyst. The direct utility of LSPR is that optical absorption range of TiO2 and ZnO can be expanded to visible and even up to the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum. Sometimes, bi-metallic type metals can act as both a cocatalyst and a sensitizer. For example, Reddy et al. [9] studied the co-catalytic functioning of Cu and the sensitizing effect of Ag in Cu/Ag decorated TiO2 nanotubes for photocatalytic H2 progression under the natural solar illumination.\nThe Schottky barrier created can repress the rearrangement of charge carriers produced by photo-activity across noble metal and metal oxide interface. Schottky barricade formed at the NMeMO interface depends upon the role of NM (fM) and attraction of electrons of MO (XSM). Usually, the assessment of fM is >XSM, where XSM is the energy variation between the vacuum energy (Vac) and least of the conduction band (CB). When NMs and MOs come to closure, the shift of electrons from MO to NM and vice-versa until they attain equilibrium state, because of the yielding of CB (i.e., the formation of Schottky barricade fB). Further, this charge reorganization direct to the generation of the built-in electric field at the crossing point, which suppresses charge carrier rearrangement and enhances photocatalytic activity. For example, Dosado et al. [37] stated the SPR effect of Au in Aue TiO2 composite system for a photocatalytic H2 generation. Here, the Schottky contact created by Au through SPR effect acting as “electron sinks” and in this manner reduces the electron-hole rearrangement.\nAn essential feature of NMs to improve photocatalytic actions is the formation of catalytic reactive sites for reduction reactions. A reactive site is a point on the outer most surface (0.3e3 nm) of the catalyst where strong chemical bonds can be formed with an adsorbed atom or molecule [66]. These sites can be edge sites, grain boundaries and unsaturated atoms in the solid, resulting from surface indiscretion, disruption, boundaries of crystals that split along grain borders and some surface vacancies [67]. Ni et al. [67] reviewed the edges as active sites for H2 generation and other photocatalytic applications with MoS2 and other NPs. These types of catalytic active sites can be Lewis acid sites and Barnstead acid sites.\nTo analyze the number of reactive sites, a grouping of surface sensitive techniques and reactivity revision must be designed [67,68]. For example, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) can be used to quantify the edge reactive sites of the catalyst. Jaramillo et al. [68] identified the active edge sites of MoS2 onto Au substrate by STM for electrochemical H2 evolution. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were also used to identify the edge sites [69].\nOverall water splitting using noble metal-metal oxide photocatalysts The overall water splitting using noble metal-metal photocatalysts is an efficient approach for concurrent production of H2 and O2. To achieve this configuration, noble metals like Au, Ag, Pt, Rh, Pd, and Ru have been studied. To achieve largely water splitting, two co-catalysts are used for H2 and O2\ngeneration. One of these act as H2 evolution co-catalyst, while the other is used asO2 evolution co-catalyst [70]. Fig. 8 displays schematic of such water splitting on MO photocatalyst using H2 and O2 evolution co-catalysts. Earlier, Domen at al [71]. have reported on the overall water splitting using noble metals such as Rh, Ru on GaNeZnS catalyst. Further, the authors also reported Pt, Pd as H2 evolution co-catalysts as well as RuO2, IrO2, and CoOx as O2 evolution co-catalysts on the Ta3N5 catalyst.\nApart from above, even single co-catalysts are used for H2 or O2 generation using suitable sacrificial agents (electron donors or electron acceptors). However, generally noble metals are employed as H2 evolution co-catalysts in the presence of hole scavengers, wherein noble metals act as either co-catalyst or visible light sensitizers based on the light sources and the type of noble metal employed. In subsequent sections, we will discuss the role of noble metals as cocatalysts and sensitizers for an improved H2 generation.\nMorphology of the metal oxides deposited by noble metals can strongly influence the catalytic performance, especially 1-D nanostructured metal oxides like nanorods, nanotubes, nanobelts, nanowires and nanofibers have been showing improved activity due to their unique properties like high surface to volume ratio, more number of active sits, unidirectional flow of electrons. Wang et al. [72] reviewed important features of 1-D TiO2 nanostructures (nanowires, nanorods, nanobelts) for various applications like solar cells, batteries, supercapacitors and sensing. In addition, Lee et al. highlighted the TiO2 nanotubes properties. Mainly, they explained the important (realized and anticipated) beneficial features of using TiO2 nanotubes or nanotube arrays. The classic 1D quantum size effects on electronic properties may lead to reduced electron scattering (or in an extreme case to ballistic transport). Fig. 9 depicts the beneficial features of nanotubes like size confinement, atomically curved surface and so on.\nNoble metals as co-catalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen generation In photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction, most of the noble metals act as co-catalysts on a semiconductor catalyst. Recent literature on noble metal-metal oxide composites is summarized in Table 1, where the co-catalytic role of noble metals is explained. Different noblemetals like Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh can be set down on metal oxides semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO, and Fe2O3 with different arrangements such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes for a photocatalytic H2 generation. The Schottky contact formed between the noble metal and semiconductor helps in improving the H2 evolution rate. For example, TiO2 and Pt are brought into contact the thermal equilibrium, redistribution of electric charges occur due to difference in characteristic Fermi levels (Ef) and work function (Fm) of the metal. Pt has (5.6 eV) greater work function than TiO2 (4.2 eV) whichmakes migration of electrons from semiconductor to the metal, there reduction reactions takes place for H2 from H þ [74]. Fig. 10 shows the energy level diagram and the formation of Schottky junction for transfer of electrons to metal. Zuo et al. [75] reported the Pt deposited TiO2 nanoparticles for photocatalytic H2 production under UV light and explained the co-\nTable 1 e Recent literature data on noble metals as co-catalyst and as a sensitizer for a photocatalytic H2 generation. The TiO2/Au composite showed the highest H2 generation with Au as co-catalyst in methanol-water mixtures under UVeVis light irradiation compared to other composite photocatalysts and TiO2/Ag nanotube composites showed the highest activity with Ag as a visible light sensitizer in the ethanol-water mixture under solar light irradiation. Note: The values reported in six columns are based on specific experimental conditions described in the specific studies and direct comparison between these values should not be done.\nPhotocatalyst Noble metal co-catalyst\nSynthesis method Test solution Light source H2 production mmol. h 1 g 1cat\nRef.\nTiO2 particles Pt Cold plasma impregnation CH3OH þ H2O 300 W, Hg lamp 4400 [75] ZnO pyramids Ag Seed-mediated C6H15NO3þH2O 300 W, Xe lamp 121 [76] ZnO nano structures Au Thermal calcination C2H5OH þ H2O 300 W, HgeXe lamp 427 [79] TiO2eZnO particles Pt Impregnation CH3OH þ H2O 300 W, Hg lamp, l > 400 nm 2150 [42] V2O5/N,SeTiO2 Pt Solid state reaction CH3OH þ H2O 125 W, Hg lamp, l > 400 nm 2960 [88] Fe2O3eTiO2 Pt Precipitation deposition C2H5OH þ H2O We bulb 8275 [43] TiO2 NPs Au Sol-gel, precipitation CH3OH þ H2O 300 W, Xe lamp, l > 390 nm 1,60,000 [89] TiO2 nanorods Au Hydrothermal deposition-precipitation Alcohol þ H2O 100 W - lamp, l ¼ 365 31,800 [37] TiO2 NPs Au Solvated metal atom dispersion CH3OH þ H2O 450 W, Hg lamp, l > 300 nm 1600 [90] TiO2 nanosheets Pd Hydrothermal photochemical reduction C2H5OH þ H2O 300 W, Xe lamp, UV light 3096 [7] TiO2 particles Au, Pt Sol-gel wet impregnation CH3OH þ H2O 150 W, Halide lamp, 7200 [91] ZnO nanowires Au Thermal decomposition chemical reduction Na2SeNa2SO3þH2O UVeVisible\nl > 300 nm 853 [77]\nTiO2 NPs Au, Impregnation CH3CH2 CH2OH þ H2O Xe lamp 460 <l < 700 nm\n0.5 [35]\nTiO2 NPs Pd\nPt\nDeposition-precipitation C2H5OH þ H2O 200 W, UV l ¼ 300 nm\n34,000 41,000\n[92]\nWO3/TiO2 nanotubes Rh Hydrothermal sol-gel CH3CH2 CH2OH þ H2O UV,Visible l ¼ 365, 450 nm\n4680 [93]\nTiO2 nanobelts Ru Hydrothermal impregnation\nchemical reduction\nC10H16N2O8þH2O 300 W, Xe lamp 25,340 [94]\nTiO2 nanorods Rh\nNb\nSol-gel-hydrothermal and solid-state phase transformation\nCH3OH þ H2O 300 W, Xe lamp 7850 [95]\nZnO nanosheets Au Hydrothermal reduction Na2SeNa2SO3þH2O 300 W, Xe lamp 350 [87] TiO2 NPs Ag QDs Sol-gel C2H8O3þH2O Natural Sun light 8419 [8] TiO2 NPs Au Deposition-precipitation photo-deposition CH3OH þ H2O 300 W, Xe lamp, l ¼ 365, 450 nm 690 [22] TiO2 nanotubes Ag Hydrothermal photo-deposition C2H5OH þ H2O Natural Sun light 23,300 [9]\nin t e r n a t io n a l jo u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 4 4 (2 0 1 9 ) 1 0 4 5 3 e 1 0 4 7 2\n1 0 4 6 2\ncatalytic role of Pt.

Here, the effect of gold loading and drying temperatures on morphological, physicochemical and photocatalytic features of TiO2 nanorods were examined. Machin et al. [77] explained the co-catalytic role of Au on ZnO nanowires with Na2SeNa2SO3 as sacrificial agents under the UVevisible irradiation.\nParticle-particle interaction in noble metal as co-catalysts. The nature of the interaction of noble metals with metal oxides is known to greatly influence the catalytic activity. Generally, such interactions may involve: (i) particle-particle interaction, where noble metals (NMs) are deposited onto metal oxides (MOs) as small particles or (ii) core-shell type interaction, where noblemetal can be coated by a thin layer of metal oxide to protect from photo-corrosion. These interactions exert\nFig. 11 e Schematic representation of particle-particle inte\ntheir impact on photo-activity and they depend on the selection of the synthetic approach. Fig. 11 displays the schematic representation of the two types of interactions as mentioned above.\nIt may be noted that in particle-particle type interactions, various types ofmetal oxide nanostructures (MOs), (TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, and Bi2O3) are involved as photocatalysts includingNPs, 1-D nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts and decorated by various noble metals (NMs) like Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Rh, Ru, and Nb. These NMs can as act as either sensitizer or cocatalyst depending upon the type of light sources used. Zhao et al. [78] showed the synthesis of Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalysts using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for H2 production and CO2 reduction. Fig. 12 shows the mechanism of Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites prepared by spray pyrolysis. Sampaio et al. [79] reported Au-loaded ZnO samples of different morphologies like a needle- and flower-like, and rod-shaped by thermal calcination process and tested these for photocatalytic H2 generation from thewater-ethanol solution under the UVevisible elucidation. Similarly, Wu et al. [80] reported Au nanorods semi-coated with TiO2 by wet chemistry methods for H2 production.\nraction and core-shell type interaction of NM/MO NPs.\nNoble metals as visible light sensitizers in photocatalytic hydrogen generation Based on the type of metals, light sources, and synthesis methods, the role of metals can be different on metal oxide catalyst. For instance, under exposure to UV light, most of the noble metals act as co-catalysts, whereas under the visible light irradiation, they may act as sensitizers, resulting in an insertion of electrons into the conduction band of the metal oxide semiconductor via the surface (Plasmon resonance (SPR) effect). For example, Lian et al. [81] explained the SPR effect of Ag quantum dots decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays.\nHere, the size Ag quantum dot effect the catalytic activity and plasmonic states of Ag allows SPRmediated electrons injected into CB of TiO2, which further participate in reduction reactions. Fig. 13 shows the light penetrating mechanism and SPR effect of Ag in TiO2 for improved activity.\nParticle-particle interaction in noble metal as a sensitizer. This strategy includes MO photocatalysts and NM as a visible light sensitizer deposited onto the surface of MO by physical interaction; the NM sensitizer used here could be Ag or Au and MO or even TiO2, ZnO, Bi2O3, and Fe2O3. These NMs so\nin TiO2 for improved activity (Reprinted with permission\ndeposited onto the surface of the MO can sensitize the light photons and inject into CB of the MO due to the SPR effect. Here, the effectiveness of interaction depends on the type of methodology adopted for depositing NM onto the MO surface. For instance, the wet impregnation method, photodeposition, and chemical reduction are most frequently used for the deposition of NMs onto TiO2 or ZnO. Moreover, NMs thus prepared is more interactive to MO when deposited by chemical reduction or photo-deposition methods.\nCore-shell type interaction in noble metal as a sensitizer. In these types of systems, a thin layer of MO shell can be coated onto NM core particles. This is the appropriate procedure to inhibit coalescence and declining of the metal NPs because of their contact with strong chemicals. He et al. [82] reported Au/ TiO2 yolk-shell structures synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal route for a photocatalytic H2 generation. Hirakawa et al. [83] reported the separation of charge and AgeTiO2 catalytic activity in core-shell photocatalyst (Fig. 14). Moreover, many novel methodologies have been adopted for effective tuning of metal oxide shell thickness and size of noble metal core as well. To name few, Sol-gel technique is an important approach to prepare highly dispersible core-shell nanoparticles, for example Sakai et al. [84] reported highly dispersed AgeTiO2 core-shell nanocapsules. Fig. 15 shows the TEM images of highly dispersed AgeTiO2 core-shell nanoparticles with Ag-core size of 10 nm and the TiO2 shell thickness about 5e10 nm. The reduction method is also an important technique to effectively form the core-shell structures and also the shell thickness and core diameter can be effectively controlled by varying the concentration of the shell and core precursors. Recently, Lee et al. [85] investigated the\neffect of Cu2O shell thickness by varying the Cu to Ag molar ratio. Fig. 16 reveals the variation Cu2O shell thickness with by changing the Cu to Ag molar ratio (2:1, 4:1, 8:1), the measured shell thicknesses are 5.8 nm, 8.1 nm and 11.0 nm for each molar ratio.\nKamat et al. [86]. explained the charge transport properties in AueTiO2 core-shell photocatalysts. It was reported that when Au and TiO2 in contact, the transfer to electrons from the excited TiO2 into Au continues until the two systems attain equilibration. The negative shift in the Fermi level is a result of better charge separation and more reductive power for the composite system. Fig. 17 illustrates the shift in the Fermi level of the composite as a result of charge equilibration between semiconductor and metal nanoparticles."

      "text" : "Overall an informative data has been given in this review on how the NM andmetal oxides based composite can enrich the photocatalytic activity and the beneficial roles of NMs (cocatalysts, sensitizers) in the way of improving the activity of the metal oxide semiconductor catalyst. The SPR effect of Ag, Au for utilization of visible light photons and injections of electrons into SC material has evaluated. Also the improved activity of 1D nanostructures over 0D particles were discussed through high surface area, quantum confinement.\nTable 1 summarizes the literature data on sensitizing role of noble metals on metal oxide composite catalyst for H2 generation. Hu et al. [87] investigated Au-decorated ZnO nanosheets for a photocatalytic H2 generation as well as RhB degradation. Here, the surface plasmon resonance outcome of Au was explained for an improved H2 generation. Reddy et al. [8] explained the localized surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR) of Ag quantum dots on TiO2 nanoparticles for an enhanced photocatalytic H2 generation in presence of solar light irradiation with glycerol as the sacrificial agent (Fig. 18). The optimized Ag/TiO2 composite catalysts showed 4-times higher activity than the standard P-25 NPs.\nQian et al. [22] reported surface plasmon driven water reduction of Au on TiO2 nanoparticles for H2 manufacturing in the presence of visible light. However, Reddy et al. [9] reported Cu/Ag@TiO2 nanotube composites and explained the sensitizing role of Ag for photocatalytic H2 generation of 23,300mmolh 1 g 1 under thesolar light irradiation.This further suggests thatnoblemetalcanbeusedaseitherasensitizerorcocatalyst to improve the photocatalytic performance.\nThe overview of all the material discussed in Table 2 was summarized in terms of technological maturity, cost effectiveness, efficiency, economies of scale; scale of development: micro-, macro-, pilot, industrial, potential of energy storage from hydrogen production in Table 2 as follows.\nAlthough a wide variety of NM-MO systems have been developed, still it needs significant improvements to either expand new synthesis methods or modify the current procedures to effectively tune the arrangement and thicknesses of the metal oxide shells as well as the shapes and sizes of noble metal cores. Even though a variety of metal-metal oxide coreeshells have been prepared in the literature, most of these materials consist of Au, Pd, and Ag as the core, but few\nn-type metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2, SnO2, In2O3, and WO3 as the shell. Since there is no new investigation available regarding innovative combinations, like Ir and Os can be used as core metals together utilizing metal oxide shells, such as Co3O4 or MoO3.\nAnother new strategy can be effectively developed that could further add a new novelty to the existing or already explored metal-metal oxide nanocomposites comprising of hierarchical structures, resulting in 1-D or 2-D\nnanomaterials with a high surface-to-volume ratio such as nanorods, nanofibers, nanowires, or nanobelts and natural polymers. Recently, Nadagouda et al. [96] revealed that ruthenium chitosan composite (as depicted in Fig. 19) could split water into H2 and O2 under microwave irradiation. It performs the dual task: it produces H2 under microwave irradiation as well as catalysing the reduction of a nitro group into an amine.

      "heading" : "Conclusions and outlook",
      "text" : "The importance of an energy carrier H2 renewable is emphasized as an effective solution for meeting the energy crisis. Nanocomposites comprises of multi-materials which have been developed to improve the basic features of the principal materials. The multifunctional features of these nanomaterials have incessantly attracted scientific attention by a large number of researchers. This re-evaluation has addressed the topical progress on the production methods of noble metal-metal oxide composite\nnanostructures and their multifunctional properties. It can be concluded that noble metal-metal oxide (NM-MO)-based nanostructured materials are the most attractive to improve photocatalytic activity compared to bulk particles or structured materials. However, skilful observation and highly embarrassed synthetic parameters are required to prepare these multifunctional materials, and hence, there is no single production procedure developed so far, which can effectively and precisely manage (geometrical) diverse properties of metal-metal oxide nanocomposites.\nFurthermore, an overview of energy storage technologies has been demanding to store the H2 energy in a safe manner. Since the hydrogen-based energy storage systems are receiving increasing attention at the present time, especially when provided their integration with renewable power sources. The essential elements comprise an electrolyser unit that converts the electrical energy input into hydrogen, the hydrogen storage system itself, and a hydrogen energy conversion system to convert the stored chemical energy in the hydrogen back to electrical energy."

    "abstractText" : "Nanoparticles have plenty of active sites in each particle and short travel distance for photoexcitons proved to be beneficial characteristics for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Noble metal (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh) attached with semiconductor photocatalyst displayed plasmonic oscillations results in localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and schottky junction formed to pump the photoelectrons to surface for reactions. Literature reports evidenced that the choice of synthesis method and experimental conditions directly affects the catalytic and optical properties. Hence, this review discusses comprehensive information on chemical methods reported for the preparation of plasmonic photocatalyst that resulted in co-catalyst and visible light sensitizer properties. Recent developments and achievements on plasmonic photocatalyst for hydrogen production in pure water and sacrificial agent containing water are discussed",
