Three different levels (0, 0.1 and 0.2 %) of Fe-EDDHA, urea, and Fe-urea nano-complex were sprayed at 1) four leaved stage and 2) previous the flowering inception of sweet basil seedlings. The highest amount of the major compounds in the essential oil, epi-α-cadinol (27.09±2.5 %) and trans-α-bergamotene (14.93±1.77 %), were achieved by the application of 0.2 % n[Fe-urea]. Application of 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] in comparison with control treatment decreased the n-Decane quantity significantly (by 99.1 %). Amongst the flavonoids and phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the prevailing compounds in basil’s essential oils. The highest amount of rosmarinic acid (5.81± 0.18 mg g−1) was found in 0.2 % [Fe-urea] nano-complex treatment. The highest antioxidant activity (21.98± 1.3 mg AAE g−1) was found in n[Fe-urea] treated plants. Also, The lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans were 0.042±0.008, 0.016±0.003, 0.238± 0.024, 0.166± 0.025, 0.101±0.021 and 0.129±0.011 mg mL-1 of essential oil derived from treated basils with 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] foliar spraying, respectively. The results revealed that nanoparticles can provide new prospects in medicinal plant production and the improvement of pharmaceutical properties of medicinal plants."

      "text" : "Major part of the Iran’s soils has been calcareous, with crop product in soils due to high pH, deficiency of micronutrients and lack of sufficient organic material has always been faced with some difficulties. Alkaline pH and high concentration of calcium ion have caused some of the nutrients that can be absorbed by pH to be insoluble and unusable for the plant (Jafari et al., 2012). Despite increasing soil pH, the large amount of bicarbonate ion produced in calcareous soils, reduces the ability to absorb of micronutrients by the plant, especially iron (Hejazi and Kafashi Sedghi, 2000). Iron is one of the essential and immobile elements. This element in the partitioning the elements necessary for the growth and development of plants, based on biochemical function involves in a group which plays an important role in the reactions of electron transfer (ET). It is one of the most important elements in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions of plants (Taiz and Zeiger, 2010). Iron is very important in enzymatic system and plants respiration so that is the part of catalytic group of lots of redox enzymes such as\ncatalase and peroxidase (Sun et al., 2007). Also, the iron plays a role in forming cytochrome, nonheme iron proteins and azote stability (Evans and Sorger, 1966).\nNitrogen as one of the main structural elements in many important molecules including proteins, nucleic acids, some of hormones and chlorophyll play a significant role in plant nutrition (Nijjar, 1990). Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers to improving productivity is an important goal in all agricultural systems (Dong et al., 2002). Urea is a white crystalline solid containing 46 % of nitrogen which is used as one of the common and available sources for foliar application (Shamsudin et al., 2012). Among nitrogenous compounds, urea is the most common form of nitrogen for spraying due to rapid absorption, inexpensive price and high solubility (Bondada et al., 2001). It has been revealed that the cuticular membrane is 10–20 times more permeable to urea than other nitrogen sources, including nitrate and ammonium (Yamada et al., 1965). Therefore, the leaves are able to absorb urea during the foliar application.\nFoliar application is considered as a quick way to add water-soluble\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109222 Received 17 October 2019; Received in revised form 20 January 2020; Accepted 22 January 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\nfertilizers to the plant leaves (Solanki et al., 2015). Foliar application is very efficient when the root of the plant is incapable to absorb sufficient quantities of mineral elements from the soil (Fageria, 2009). Foliar application of mineral elements is very useful not only for the arrival of the plant to the higher performance, but also to improve the nutrient deficiencies and to improve the macro- and microelements in the plant (El-Sheikh et al., 2007). The foliar application is used as a method to provide complementary amounts of macro- and microelements, plant growth regulation (PGR), and other important materials. Given to the type of plant species, type and concentration of minerals applied, application time and plant growth phase, the plants’ response to the foliar application is positive, negative or neutral (Fageria, 2009).\nThe usability of nanotechnology in different fields of agricultural sciences and natural resources is much more extensive than other sciences. Nanotechnology is a science of change, manipulation, and placing particles in Nano-sizes in order to build human used tools. As we approach the nano scales, the ratio of the surface to the volume of materials increases; in this case, the number of molecules existed in the surface increases compared to the inner particles; this factor causes: a) Those on the surface are more active, b) The ability of bonding increases in these molecules and c) In the case of the catalytic property existence, this property would increase. Higher plants interact strongly with their surrounding environment, so they are expected to be influenced by nanoparticles (Castiglione et al., 2011). On the nano scale, most atoms are on the surface of the substance that do not have the conditions and limitations of inner atoms. The development of nanotools and nano-materials can provide new applications in plant biotechnology (Scrinis and Lyons, 2007). Nano agricultural chemicals enclosed should have all the necessary features, including effective concentration (solubility, stability and high efficiency), controlled diffusion time in response to the specific stimuli, increased targeted activities and less toxicity associated with easy-use (Green and Beestman, 2007; Moraru et al., 2003; Tsuji, 2001). This study was an attempt to obtain new data on the efficiency and superiority of[Fe-urea] nanocomplex on phytochemical compounds, antioxidant activity and antimicrobial potential of the essential oil of sweet basil."

Plants were grown under natural light in the greenhouse (approximately 800–1000 μmol m−2 s−1 PAR-photosynthetically active radiation) with a 12 h photoperiod and temperature between 23−26 °C. The soil samples were air-dried. Then, they were passed through a 2-mm sieve and mixed uniformly. Physical and chemical characteristics of the soil were measured by standard methods (Table 1). 50 mg P and N kg−1 soil as KH2PO4, NH4NO3 were applied to the soil, while 5 mg Mn, Zn and Cu kg−1 soil as MnSO4.H2O, ZnSO4.7H2O and CuSO4.5H2O were applied, respectively.\nSeeds of sweet basil were collected from an herbal garden of Bazrco Company in Tehran, Iran. They were potted in 7 L plastic pots filled with soil. Pots were irrigated twice a week using deionized water. After\nthinning and previous the flowering inception of plants, they were divided in 7 groups; control (deionized water), plants sprayed with 0.1 or 0.2 % Fe-EDDHA, plants sprayed with 0.1 or 0.2 % Fe-urea nano complex and plants sprayed with 0.1 or 0.2 % urea. The fertilizers were obtained from a knowledge-based organization named “Zist Nano Fanavaran Atiyeh Pajooh” located at the Fars Science and Technology Park (Shiraz, Iran). The size of Fe-urea nano particles were determined by the transmission electron micrographs (TEM) (100 kV Philips, EM208) (Fig. 1). Using Tensor II FTIR spectrometer, the FTIR spectra were obtained (Fig. 2). Basils were collected at full bloom stage, and afterward were dried in the shade for 5 days."

The Retention Indices (RIs) of essential oil volatile components were determined based on Retention Times (RT) for n-alkanes (C8-C25) under temperature-programmed and the same chromatographic conditions (Adams, 2007).\n2.4. Identification of phenolics and flavonoids of the extracts\nThe standards for all phenolic compounds (rosmarinic acid, gallic acid, carvacrol, cinnamic acid and ferulic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, kaempferol, luteolin, rutin, and quercetin) were used based on the Sigma-Aldrich brand. To measure the amounts of phenolics compounds and flavonoids by the HPLC device (Agilent 1200 series) was used. The UV detector was set at a wavelength of 280 and 320 nm with an oven temperature of 30 °C. 20 μL of the dissolved extract was injected into Zorbax eclipse (XDB) C18 column (4.6 × 5 μm i.d.; ×150 mm film thickness). Methanol: formic acid 1 % was selected as mobile phase with the flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Accordingly, gradient elution program was selected from (10:90); next it was planned to reach (25:75) during 10 min; shifting to (60:40) in 20 min. In the next step, the ratio was selected on (70:30) which was kept isocratic for 40 min."

      "heading" : "3.2. Essential oil yields and variables of vegetative growth",
      "text" : "Results showed that the application of iron and urea sources significantly increased the essential oil yields and variables of vegetative growth compared to the control treatment (p<0.05) (Table 2). The application of 0.2 % Fe-urea nano complex caused the highest amount of plant weight (311±4 g plant−1) which was 82.94 % more than the control treatment. According to our results, the application of this treatment can increase the plant height of sweet basil by 50.46 %, compared to the control treatment (Table 2).\nThe effect of nitrogen on raising the vegetative growth is caused by a change in the balance of plant hormones in vegetative parts. The consumption of nitrogen by decreasing the ratio of abscisic acid to gibberellin leads to an increase in plant’s vegetative growth (Marschner, 2012). Nitrogen is involved in synthesis of critical compounds such as amino acids, proteins and nucleic acids, and is an important component of chlorophyll and rubisco molecules. Nitrogen caused to produce carbohydrates and thus increased performance by increasing carbon-uptake level and developing aerial parts (Salardini, 2003; Tso, 2005). Iron role in the nitrogen fixation and the activity of some enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase and cytochrome oxidase have been well studied (Sun et al., 2007). Given to the role of iron in the biosynthesis of hormones, nitrogen uptake and photosynthesis (Hänsch and Mendel, 2009), increasing the vegetative growth and biomass production are expected. In general, there is a close relationship between the content of nitrogen and iron in leaves and the photosynthetic capacity (Taiz and Zeiger, 2010). There has been observed the effect of foliar application of iron fertilizers in increasing vegetative growth of basil (El-Gendy et al., 2001), anis (Pirzad et al., 2013), corn (Whitty, 1998) and coriander (Said-Al Ahl and Omer, 2009) due to the role of iron in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and the concentration of indole acetic acid (IAA). Also, there was a direct correlation between nitrogen consumption and increase in biomass production in basil (Yassen et al., 2003; Biesiada and Kuś, 2010; Arabaci and Bayram, 2004), moldavian dragonhead (Safikhani, 2007), oregan (Barreyro and Ringuele, 2005) and lemon balm (Abbaszadeh et al., 2009), which is in consistent with the results of this research.\nOur results showed that the application of foliar spraying of 0.2 % Fe-urea nano complex resulted in higher essential oil yields (0.56±0.01 g 100g−1) in sweet basil (Table 2). In previous studies, the positive effect of nitrogen has been reported on improving the essential oil yields in Ocimum basilicum (Kndeel et al., 2002), Anethum graveolens (Bist et al., 2000), Nigella sativa (El-Sayed et al., 2000) and Artemissia annua L. (Özgüven et al., 2008). The increase in essential oil yields due to the nitrogen consumption can be attributed to the fact that the\nnitrogen plays an important role in developing the new cells containing essential oil, channels, glands, and glandular trichomes. The researchers reported that the application of nitrogen increases the secretory glandular of essential oil in peppermint leaves (Marotti et al., 1994). The reason for the increase of the essential oil glands is production and the consumption of simple carbohydrates and consequently development of the leaf surface. Therefore, nitrogen increases vegetative growth, the development of the leaves and consequently producing essential oil (Brown, 2003). Essential oils contain the terpeneid compounds that their constructor units such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate have an urgent need for ATP and NADPH, and with regard to the subject that the nitrogen and iron are essential for the formation of recent compounds, and ultimately have improved essential oil yields. The positive effect of foliar application of nano iron chelate on the essential oil yields of cress (Salarpour et al., 2013), peppermint (Zehtab-Salmasi et al., 2008) and chamomile (Nasiri et al., 2010) has been reported. Given to the effect of iron on plant growth, one of the reasons for the increase of photosynthetic activity is the role of this element in structure of the chloroplast, which leads to the production of more essential oil glands in leaves (Evans, 2009). It seems that micronutrients increase the essential oil yields through their effect on dry matter and not the turgor pressure (Ziaeyan and Malakouti, 1998)."

      "text" : "Thirty-eight essential oil compounds were identified in the control treatment of the sweet basil’s essential oil (Table 3). The result shows that the main essential oil components of sweet basil in the control treatment were characterized by a high content of epi-α-cadinol (16.67 %), followed by n-Decane (13.39 %), linalool (10.45 %), and bornyl acetate (9.34 %) (Table 3). Foliar application of iron and urea sources considerably has changed chemical components of essential oil. After application of urea (0.2 and 0.1 %), n[Fe-urea] (0.2 and 0.1 %) and FeEDDHA (0.2 and 0.1 %), thirty-nine, fifty-nine, twenty, fifty-eight, fiftynine and fifty-nine compounds were identified in the essential oil, respectively. The major sesquiterpenes in essential oil after foliar spraying were epi-α-cadinol and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, the lowest number of sesquiterpenes in essential oil realized in 0.2 % Fe-urea nano-complexes treatment. Furthermore, the highest amount of epi-αcadinol (27.09±2.5 %) and trans-α-bergamotene (14.93± 1.77 %) in the essential oil of basil was achieved by the application of 0.2 % n[Feurea].\nTerpenoids have antimicrobial, antioxidant and antitumor activity, and effect on cardiovascular and central nervous systems (QuintansJúnior et al., 2010). Also, terpenoids are widely used as drugs, fragrances, flavors, and colors (Misawa, 2011). Terpenoids play an important role in the redox reactions (lateral chains of ubiquinone and plastoquinone), structure of the membrane (sterols and hopanoids), carotenoid and chlorophyll lateral chains and the plant hormone (Phillipson, 2007). The amount of the essential oil of basil varies from 0.5 to 1.5 percent depending on the climatic conditions of the growth area (Omidbaigi, 2014). Based on available references, the essential oils chemotypes of Persian basil is full of methyl chavicol, linalool, epi-αcadinol and trans-α-bergamotene (Sajjadi, 2006; Tavallali et al., 2018). In addition to basil, epi-α-cadinol is an alcoholic compound that has been found in essential oil of Cinnamomum osmophloem. It has an antiinflammatory effect (Tung et al., 2008). It is also found in the essential oil of Taiwania cryptomerioides, which has anti-mite effect against Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farina haghes (Chang et al., 2001). In a research by Rustaiyan et al. (2006), α-cadinol was identified as the dominant component of essential oil of Ballota aucheri.\nOur results showed that the application of 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] in comparison with control treatment decreased the n-Decane quantity significantly (99.1 %) from 13.399±1.92 % to 0.12±0.01 %. nDecane is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C10H22\nData are mean± standard deviation of eight replications. †Means followed by the same letter within a column are not significantly different according to Duncan’s multiple range test at P<0.05.\nthat is known as an environmental polluter. However, its toxicological properties have not been thoroughly investigated (HSDB, 2002).\nPreviously, the positive effect of nitrogen on chemical composition and yield of essential oil of thyme has been reported (Omidbaigi et al., 2000). Previous studies have shown that iron effectively led to an increase in secondary metabolites, especially the terpenes (Pourebrahimi et al., 2014). It has been reported that foliar application of iron lead to an increase in essential oil yields of basil (Said-Al Ahl and Mahmoud, 2010)."

      "text" : "In this study, five flavonoids (catechin, kaempferol, luteolin, rutin, and quercetin) and five phenolic compounds (rosmarinic acid, gallic acid, carvacrol, cinnamic acid and ferulic acid) were detected in the extract of treated basils (Table 4). Interestingly, carvacrol, kaempferol, luteolin, rutin and ferulic acid were not identified in control treatment. When various Fe-EDDHA, Fe-urea nano complexes and urea were applied, the content of both flavonoids and phenolic compounds rose considerably in basil’s extract compared to the control treatment. In between the flavonoids and phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the prevailing compounds in basil’s extracts. The highest amount of rosmarinic acid (5.81± 0.18 mg g−1) was found in 0.2 % Fe-urea nano complex treatment followed by 0.1 % Fe-urea nano complex treatment which increased the rosmarinic acid to 5.62±0.22 mg g−1, provided the lowest amount (2.43± 0.12 mg g−1) obtained in untreated plants.\nIron deficiency in some plants causes a decrease in the phenolic content (Pestana et al., 2010). However, there is a little information about the role of iron in the production of secondary metabolites (Yeritsyan and Economakis, 2001). The use of iron nanoparticles in plants seems to be more efficient than conventional fertilizers. Perhaps one of the reasons for the rise of phenolic compounds in the effect of iron and nitrogen is the rise of the production of the photosynthesis substances and additional carbon allocation to the shikimic acid pathway (Nguyen et al., 2010).\nAn investigation of the local varieties of the basil in Iran showed that the plant has a very diverse phenolic compound, among which rosmarinic acid is the dominant hydroxycinnamic acid ester (Javanmardi et al., 2002). Rosmarinic acid is an ester of caffeic acid and 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid. It is commonly found in species of the Boraginaceae and the subfamily Nepetoideae of the Lamiaceae (Wang et al., 2004). A variety of biological activities have been explained for rosmarinic acid such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial and antioxidant effects (Swarup et al., 2007).\nRedox properties of phenols play an important role in the absorption and neutralization of free radicals (Javanmardi et al., 2002). Phenolic\ncompounds are also responsible for the antibacterial properties of the extracts and essential oils (Zhang et al., 2009). Previous studies have shown that application of micronutrient nano-fertilizers led to an increase in flavonoid and phenolic contents of plants (Tavallali et al., 2017; Mahmoud and Taha, 2018). Our results showed that the application of iron and urea sources causes an increase in the contents of carvacrol in extract (Table 4). Previous studies have shown that this compound has various medicinal properties. It is antioxidant (Jaberian et al., 2013), antiviral (Chaieb et al., 2007), insecticidal (Pete et al., 2012), anti-inflammatory (Damasceno et al., 2014), antifungal (Suntres et al., 2015), cardioprotective (Friedman, 2013), antidiabetics (Bayramoglu et al., 2014) and antibiotic (Varel, 2002)."

      "text" : "Antioxidant activities of the sweet basil’s essential oils from various iron and urea treatments were evaluated applying DPPH, MDA, H2O2, and sodium nitrite scavenging effects, shown for ROS, TBARS, H2O2, and RNS scavenging activities, respectively. The IC50 values for RNS, ROS, TBARS and H2O2 scavenging activities of essential oils in comparison with control treatment were decreased when iron and urea sources were applied. The lowest IC50 values for ROS, TBARS, H2O2, and RNS scavenging activities were found in essential oils of basil plants which were treated with 0.2 % [Fe-urea] nano complex. The highest antioxidant activity (21.98±1.3 mg AAE g−1) was displayed by the sweet basil treated with 0.2 % [Fe-urea] nano complex, whereas the lowest antioxidant activity (9.31±1 mg AAE g−1) was found in the control treatment (Table 5). Plant antioxidants can prevent many diseases such as diabetes, liver disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease and inflammation (Uttara et al., 2009).\nThere are many factors affecting the formation and retention of antioxidant compounds which one of them is the appropriate nutrition (Kevers et al., 2011). Catalase is a large enzyme containing haem-bound iron at its active sites (Fridovich, 1978). The activity of catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase can be reduced in conditions of iron deficiency. Because these enzymes contain iron porphyrin and have a special role in plant metabolism as prosthetic groups (Sun et al., 2007). The results of Javanmardi et al. (2003) showed that the phenolic compounds of basil have high antioxidant activity, which is in consistent with the results of this research. Based on our results, this antioxidant activity is attributed to the high level of carvacrol and rosmarinic acid. Antioxidant activity of carvacrol (Jaberian et al., 2013) and rosmarinic acid (Swarup et al., 2007) has been proven in previous studies.\nResearches show that there is a positive linear relationship between antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds (Javanmardi et al., 2003).\nRI: Retention Index.; ND: Not Detected.; MH: Monoterpene Hydrocarbons.; OM: Oxygenated Monoterpenes.; SH: Sesquiterpenes Hydrocarbons., OS: Oxygenated Sesquiterpenes.; OT: Others. Data are mean± standard deviation of eight replications. †Means followed by the same letter within a row are not significantly different according to Duncan’s multiple range test at P< 0.05.\nPlants protect themselves against oxidative damage through the antioxidant defense systems (Gill and Tuteja, 2010). Antioxidants are substances that can reduce the oxidative stress in cells and can inhibit free radicals, prevent oxidation and strengthen the immune system. Also, antioxidants have antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-diabetic activities (Mohajerani, 2012; Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2008)."

      "text" : "The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest essential oils concentration that induced more than 90 percent growth depletion in comparison with the growth in the control treatment. In this study MIC for fungi (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans) growth, Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria was determined. Generally, the application of iron and urea sources significantly increased the antibacterial and antifungal activity of essential oils compared to the control treatment (p<0.05) (Table 6). The lowest minimal inhibitory concentration for Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans were 0.042±0.008, 0.016±0.003, 0.238±0.024, 0.166±0.025, 0.101± 0.021 and 0.129± 0.011 mg mL−1 of essential oil derived from treated basils with 0.2 % Fe-urea nano complex foliar spraying, respectively.\nEssential oil of basil has been used for a wide range of applications such as cooking spices, medicinal treatments, pesticides, aromatherapy, perfumery and food preservatives (Li and Chang, 2016). Extracts and essential oils have antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant and anticancer activity and can control the growth of pathogens and the production of toxin by microorganisms (Tajkarimi et al., 2010). Given to the number of chemical compounds in the essential oil, we cannot consider a single mechanism for their antibacterial effects, but they will have several targets in the cell (Burt, 2004). One of the important properties of essential oil and their constituent parts are their hydrophobic effect, which leads their influence on the membrane lipids of bacterial cells and disrupts their structures and increases their permeability (Burt, 2004). Different bacterial and fungal species exhibit various sensitivities to phenolic compounds. These compounds include carvacrol, eugenol and thymol. Possibly, the mechanism of the effect of these compounds like other phenolic compounds, includes the following: disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane, disrupting proton dynamics and energy metabolism and coagulation of cellular contents (Burt, 2004; Tajkarimi et al., 2010). The chemical structure of essential oils also affects its mechanism of action. The importance of the presence of hydroxyl group in phenolic compounds such as carvacrol and thymol has been confirmed. However, the position of the hydroxyl group in the phenolic ring has a little effect on its antibacterial activities (Burt, 2004).\nOur results showed that the application of iron and urea sources increases the content of carvacrol in essential oil. Carvacrol and some other phenolic compounds, such as thymol, are able to disintegrate the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and cause the release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and increase the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane. In addition to inhibiting the growth of bacteria cells, carvacrol is also able to inhibit the production of toxin by bacteria (Chavan and Tupe, 2014). Antimicrobial properties of carvacrol have been reported in previous studies (Mahboubi and Kazempour, 2011). Carvacrol inhibits the growth of some bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus (Du et al., 2008). The results of Ultee and Smid (2001) showed that carvacrol can inhibit the production of toxin from Bacillus cereus that causes diarrhea. There are two theories: first due to the interference of carvacrol with the production of ATP, ATP may not be sufficiently ready to remove toxin from the cell, which is an active and energy-dependent process, and second, by lowering the specific growth rate, it may be possible that the cell spends its entire energy to survive (Burt, 2004).Ta bl e 4 Fl av on oi ds an d ph en ol ic co m po un ds of sw ee t ba si l as\naff ec te d by\nir on\nan d ni tr og\nen so ur ce s.\nTr ea tm\nen ts\nR os m ar in ic\nac id\nC at ec hi n\nG al lic\nac id\nC ar va\ncr ol\nK ae m pf er ol\nC in na\nm ic\nac id\nLu te ol in\nR ut in\nFe ru lic\nac id\nQ ue\nrc et in\nFe -E D D H A\n0. 1 %\n5. 18\n± 0. 21\nc 3. 89\n± 0. 14\nc 3. 81\n± 0. 16\nd 2. 43\n± 0. 09\na 3. 35\n± 0. 19\nb 3. 34\n± 0. 15\nc 0. 86\n± 0. 05\nb 2. 24\n± 0. 08\nb 4. 14\n± 0. 17\nc 3. 81\n± 0. 15 b Fe -E D D H A 0. 2 % 5. 51 ± 0. 22 b 4. 34 ± 0. 13 a 4. 52 ± 0. 18 b 2. 50 ± 0. 11 a 3. 48 ± 0. 15 ab 3. 66 ± 0. 14 b 1. 06 ± 0. 08 a 2. 73 ± 0. 10 a 4. 47 ± 0. 16 b 4. 10 ± 0. 16 b n[ Fe -u re a] 0. 1 % 5. 62 ± 0. 22 ab 4. 11 ± 0. 10 b 4. 03 ± 0. 15 c 2. 37 ± 0. 11 a 3. 47 ± 0. 17 ab 3. 76 ± 0. 18 ab 0. 82 ± 0. 07 b 2. 39 ± 0. 09 b 4. 22 ± 0. 14 c 3. 96 ± 0. 18 b n[ Fe -u re a] 0. 2 % 5. 81 ± 0. 18 a 4. 48 ± 0. 12 a 4. 75 ± 0. 13 a 2. 55 ± 0. 13 a 3. 56 ± 0. 18 a 3. 92 ± 0. 15 a 0. 97 ± 0. 06 ab 2. 75 ± 0. 07 a 4. 71 ± 0. 14 a 4. 41 ± 0. 15 a U re a 0. 1 % 3. 23 ± 0. 19 e 3. 61 ± 0. 12 e 3. 29 ± 0. 16 f 1. 79 ± 0. 10 b 2. 05 ± 0. 14 c 2. 99 ± 0. 14 d N D N D 1. 73 ± 0. 11 d 3. 19 ± 0. 15 cd U re a 0. 2 % 3. 61 ± 0. 19 d 3. 84 ± 0. 11 d 3. 58 ± 0. 14 e 2. 02 ± 0. 09 b 2. 11 ± 0. 16 c 3. 24 ± 0. 15 c N D N D 1. 99 ± 0. 12 d 3. 24 ± 0. 16 c C on tr ol 2. 43 ± 0. 12 f 2. 56 ± 0. 09 f 2. 45 ± 0. 10 g N D N D 2. 21 ± 0. 09 e N D N D N D 2. 99 ± 0. 15 d\nN D :N\not de\nte ct ed . † M ea ns fo llo w ed\nby th e sa m e le tt er\nw it hi n a co\nlu m n ar e no\nt si gn\nifi ca nt ly\ndi ff er en\nt ac co\nrd in g to\nD un\nca n’ s m ul ti pl e ra ng\ne te st\nat P <\n0. 05 . *C al cu la te d m ea n am ou nt of th e fl av on oi ds an d po ly ph en ol s (m g g− 1 D M ) ba se d on th e w ei gh t of th e gr ou nd dr y pl an t in ei gh t re pl ic at es\n± sd\n(s ta nd\nar d de\nvi at io n) .\nOur results showed that the effect of essential oil of basil on growth of gram-positive bacteria is slightly higher than their effect on gramnegative bacteria (Table 6). In other words, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the antibacterial effect of the essential oil. The reason for the lower sensitivity of the gram-negative bacteria may be due to the presence of external membrane in these bacteria, which limits the release of the hydrophobic components of the essential oil to the lipopolysaccharide layer (Burt, 2004). However, all studies conducted on the antibacterial activity of essential oils do not indicate a higher sensitivity of gram-positive bacteria. For example, Aeromonas hydrophila, a gram-negative bacterium is one of the most sensitive bacterial species in comparison to the effects of essential oils. Among the gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas species, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have the least susceptibility in comparison to the effect of antibacterial activity of essential oils. Successful results have been obtained related to the antimicrobial effect of essential oils (Soliman and Badeaa, 2002; Shahnia et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2004; Nielsen and Rios, 2000; Velluti et al., 2003). In previous studies, antimicrobial effects of Zataria multiflora (Mahmoudabadi et al., 2007), thymus kostschyanus and thymus persicus (Rasooli and Mirmostafa, 2003), Hyssopus officinalis (Letessier, 2001) and Artemisia sieberi (Negahban et al., 2007) have been investigated.\nIn this experiment, Fe-urea nano complex quickly inhibited the Escherichia coli (Table 6). However, in order to inhibition of this bacterium, much higher iron content under oxygen saturation conditions is required. This is due to surface oxidation and rusting of iron nanoparticles by dissolved oxygen in the environment. The bactericidal effect of iron nanoparticles is a unique feature. The results of Lee et al. (2008) showed a direct relationship between the inactivation of Escherichia coli and the use of iron nanoparticles. Selvarani and Prema, 2013, investigated the antibacterial properties of iron nanoparticles against gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-negative Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia pestis. Their results showed that iron nanoparticles had potential antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The role of iron in bactericidal capacity has not been well understood. It is unknown whether the link of iron to the DNA molecule, or specific\nproteins present in the bacterial cell, can directly inhibit cell proliferation and protein enzyme function. It has been shown that chemical interactions between iron and Escherichia coli cells are primarily responsible for the destruction of the cell membrane. Iron is a strong reducing and induces the decomposition of external membrane proteins and polysaccharides of the bacterial cells. On the other hand, the iron existed in the iron-urea complex may be oxidized by intracellular oxygen after being isolated, which results in oxidative damage. Iron nanoparticles showed stronger bactericidal activity than other nanoparticles such as silver nanoparticles (Lee et al., 2008).\nPrevious studies have shown that the chemical and biological reactivity of iron-containing nanoparticles is related to the size and surface of the nanoparticles (Waldman et al., 2007). Rod-shaped iron nanoparticles are more soluble in comparison with rod-shaped iron microparticles due to their larger surface and chemical activity (Rubasinghege et al., 2010). In addition, the shape and crystalline structure of nanomaterials can affect toxicological responses. Barzan et al. (2014) examined the antimicrobial and genotoxicity properties of iron nanoparticles on gram-positive bacterial systems of Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces and gram-negative of Erwinia amylovora and Xanthomonas oryzae. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) which inhibits the growth of Erwinia amylovora, Xanthomonas oryzae, Bacillus cereus and Streptomyces, are 625, 550, 1250, and 1280 ppm, respectively.\nIn this experiment, the antifungal activity of essential oil of sweet basil on Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans was confirmed (Table 6). In a study conducted on thymoquinone as an active ingredient of Nigella sativa seeds, the effect of inhibiting 100 % of this substance was obtained on Aspergillus niger in a concentration of 2 mg ml−1 (Al Jabre et al., 2003). Mohammadi et al. (2014) examined the antifungal activity of essential oil of thymus kostschyanus on Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata. The results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration, which inhibits the growth of Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata, are 0.5, 1, and 0.5 μg ml−1, respectively.\nValues are means of MIC in eight replicates± sd (standard deviation).

      "text" : "The effect of nitrogen and iron on plant growth reflects their positive role in photosynthetic activity and metabolism of organic compounds. Application of iron and urea sources improved the growth and biochemical parameters of sweet basil. Vegetative growth, essential oil yields, polyphenols content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of sweet basil significantly increased in response to 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] application. The results of this study showed that epi-αcadinol and rosmarinic acid were the predominant terpenoid and phenolic compound of the essential oil and the extract, respectively. Application of 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] compared to other treatments significantly increased the content of these two compounds. The high surface area to volume ratio, the continuous release of nutrients, easy absorption through the leaves and high impact are nano-fertilizers properties. These properties help to increase the efficiency of nutrients in plants. The development of nanotools and nanomaterials can provide new prospects in plant biotechnology and the achievement of sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture.\nFunding\nNo funding was received for this work.\nIntellectual property\nWe confirm that we have given due consideration to the protection of intellectual property associated with this work and that there are no impediments to publication, including the timing of publication, with respect to intellectual property.

Three different levels (0, 0.1 and 0.2 %) of Fe-EDDHA, urea, and Fe-urea nano-complex were sprayed at 1) four leaved stage and 2) previous the flowering inception of sweet basil seedlings. The highest amount of the major compounds in the essential oil, epi-α-cadinol (27.09±2.5 %) and trans-α-bergamotene (14.93±1.77 %), were achieved by the application of 0.2 % n[Fe-urea]. Application of 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] in comparison with control treatment decreased the n-Decane quantity significantly (by 99.1 %). Amongst the flavonoids and phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the prevailing compounds in basil’s essential oils. The highest amount of rosmarinic acid (5.81± 0.18 mg g) was found in 0.2 % [Fe-urea] nano-complex treatment. The highest antioxidant activity (21.98± 1.3 mg AAE g) was found in n[Fe-urea] treated plants. Also, The lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans were 0.042±0.008, 0.016±0.003, 0.238± 0.024, 0.166± 0.025, 0.101±0.021 and 0.129±0.011 mg mL-1 of essential oil derived from treated basils with 0.2 % n[Fe-urea] foliar spraying, respectively.
