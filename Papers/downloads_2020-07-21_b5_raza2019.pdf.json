      "text" : "The flow actuated by an extending boundary has extensive applications in the expulsion forms in plastic and metal ventures (Altan et al., 1979; Fisher, 1976; Tadmor and Klein, 1970). Sakiadis (1961a, b) completed a spearheading investigation and concentrated the boundary layer flow on a consistently extending surface with a steady speed, this study was further generalized by Tsou et al. (1967). Following these investigations, the boundary conditions on the extending surface were summed up by different analysts (Crane, 1970; Banks, 1983; Dutta et al., 1985; Grubka and Bobba, 1985; Chen and Char, 1988; Ali, 1995; Elbashbeshy, 1998; Magyari et al., 2001; Liao, 2005, 2007; Gireesha et al., 2016; Mahanthesh, Gireesha, Shehzad, Abbasi and Gorla, 2017; Mahanthesh, 2017). Nevertheless, researchers (Magyari et al., 2001; Liao, 2005, 2007) investigated the problems of exponentially extending velocity and quickly diminishing velocity conditions under the different fluid flow conditions. Liao (Mahanthesh, Gireesha, Shehzad, Abbasi and Gorla, 2017; Mahanthesh, 2017) examined the multiple solutions for both impermeable and permeable extending sheets. Lee (1967) was the first who investigated the flow with high Reynolds number (boundary layer concept) over a thin body with variable thickness. In the engineering science, the variable thickness extending sheet has much more applications as compared with the flat sheet. For instance, for a straightly extending sheet of an incompressible material, if the extending speed is directly relative to the separation from the slot, the sheet thickness diminishes straightly with the separation. For different materials with various extensibility, the plate/sheet thickness may alter as indicated by different profiles. An extending plate/sheet with a changeable thickness can be all the more near the circumstance in practical applications.\nThe present world is surrounded by numerous applications of nanofluids in the field of engineering and technology. The conceptualization of these fluids is in much practice in the field of biomedical and food security. Moreover, these fluids are employed as cooling of a nuclear reactor, in the aerodynamic process and in next-generation solar film collector. Choi (1995) was first one who introduced the theory of nanofluids. When convectional base fluid is combined with nanometer-sized solid particles, e.g., copper, aluminum, silver, gold, silicon nanofluids are formed. The purpose of using nanoparticles in the base fluid is to enhance thermal the conductivity of base fluids. According to Choi (1995), by adding a very small amount of nanoparticles to conventional heat carrier’s fluids, the thermal conductivity can be increased up to two times (approximately). Choi (1995) analyzed thermal conductivity of nanofluids in which nanosized copper particles added, the result showed heat transfer enhancement as a function of thermal conductivity. Mathematical modeling of nanofluids is integrated\n872\nMMMS 15,5\nas single-phase model and two-phase model. Buongiorno (2006) discussed the mathematical modeling of two-phase fluid models. He unveiled Brownian motion and thermophoresis plays vital contribution toward the enrichment of thermal conductivity of functioning fluids.\nIn 2010, Khan and Pop (2010) explored effects of thermophoresis number and Brownian motion number on the flow past a deformable/stretchable surface. Sheikholeslami et al. (2012) scrutinized the laminar type of flow in a semi-porous channel in which transverse magnetic field was applied to find the influence of Harman number on the flow. The authors developed the table of error percentage between three methods, e.g., HAM, OHAM and VIM. In 2012, Wubshet et al. (2013) investigated the influence of MHD and heat transfer on nanofluid over a stretching sheet. The flow is observed near the stagnation point. A work had been done by Soleimani et al. (2012) on heat transfer in natural convection. The flow is considered in semi-annulus, enclosed with cu-water nanofluid. Finite element scheme was employed to solve the problem. Hamad and Ferdows (2012) obtained similarity solution of stagnation point boundary layer flow over a stretching surface in the presence of suction/injection and heat generation/absorption with nanofluid. Authors found out that solution depends on Brownian motion number, thermophoresis number, stretching parameter, Prandtl number, heat generation/absorption parameter. In recent times, studies connecting with heat transfer and nanofluid flows are presented in Fakour et al. (2015, 2014), Hatami et al. (2013), Ganji et al. (2014), Mahanthesh et al.

(2016) had done a piece of work on nanofluids in rotating channel in which MHD threedimensional flow is investigated. Simultaneous outcomes of energy and concentration equation of nanofluids have been discussed. The problem of fluid flow under the various physical conditions for different structures was solved numerically using finite volume method (Mebarek-Oudina and Bessaïh, 2007a, 2010, 2014, 2016; Mebarek-Oudina, 2017; Mebarek-Oudina and Makinde, 2018).\nWilliamson fluid is representative of a non-Newtonian fluid model with shear thinning property. This model was proposed by Williamson (1929) and later on utilized by a few researchers (Nadeem and Akbar, 2010; Nadeem and Hussain, 2014, 2016) to explore fluid flow by utilizing homotopy analysis method (OHAM) to find the solution of governing system for Williamson nanofluid flow. Recently Kumar et al. (2017) examined the flow features inspired by exponential extending/contracting sheet using Williamson nanofluid subjected to chemical reaction effect. The majority of the previously mentioned examinations researched the flow and heat transport investigation confined for the just flat extending sheet. Investigation of flow and heat transfer of gooey liquids overextending sheet with a variable thickness (non-evenness) can be more important to the circumstance in handy applications. Out of the blue, Fang et al. (2012) acquired an exquisite explanatory and numerical solution for the flow due to a non-levelness extending sheet with boundary layer concept. Numerical results for the flow of a\n873\nNano Williamson\nfluid\nNewtonian fluid on an extending sheet of variable thickness with slippage were contemplated by Khader and Meghad (2013).\nIn the current paper, the magneto-nano Williamson fluid flow inspired by a stretching sheet of variable thickness is examined numerically. The rationale of the present study is to generalize the studies of Fang et al. (2012) and Khader and Meghad (2013). This manuscript is classified into four sections. Literature review in order to get brief description of the problem statement is presented in Section 1. Section 2 is devoted to present mathematical modeling of the proposed problem. Numerical solution of the system of multi-degree ordinary differential equations is presented in Section 3 and in the final section results and discussion have been highlighted for the salient features of the various physical parameters."

Effects of various physical parameters on local Nusselt number and local Sherwood number\n885\nNano Williamson\nfluid\nE on θ(η) and j(η) profiles. It is observed that both θ(η) and j(η) profiles decreases gradually by increasing in the values of E. From the physical point of view, the assumption of temperature dependent thermal conductivity suggests an increase in the magnitude of the transverse velocity by a quantity ð@=@yÞðkð@T=@yÞÞ due to thermal slip effect. Hence, the cooling rate is much slower for the coolant material having lower thermal conductivity. Effect of thermal ration parameter R on θ(η) and j(η) profiles is presented in\nFigures 13–14. Thermal boundary layer thickness increases significantly as thermal ration parameter R increases for both cases mo1 and mW1. On the other hand, totally opposite behavior is depicted from Figure 14 for nanoparticle volume fraction.\nFigures 15–16 represent the effects of diffusion parameter Nbt on θ(η) and j(η) profiles, respectively. It is observed that θ(η) and j(η) profiles decrease as Nbt increases. The effects of Lewis number Le and heat capacity parameter Nc on θ(η) and j(η) profiles are sketched in Figures 17–20. Both profiles increase as increase in the numerical values of Lewis number Le and heat capacity parameter Nc for both cases mo1 and mW1.\nUsing the slope of linear regression through the data points, the behavior of skin friction coefficient for the variations of certain physical parameters such as M, m, λ1, α and S1 is analyzed using Table I. It is depicted that the numerical values coefficient of the skin friction coefficient increases gradually with magnetic parameter M, velocity power index m, Williamson parameter λ1 and wall thickness parameter α at the rates 0.4976, 0.0861, 0.4684 and 0.6226, respectively. However, velocity slip parameter decreases the skin friction at the rate −1.5317. The local Nusselt number (Nux) increases at the rate 0.0913 for E, whereas the Sherwood number (Shx) declines at the rate −0.1082 due to E (see Table II). The Nux increases at the rate of 0.1342, 0.0080 and 0.0270 via Pr, Nbt and Le correspondingly, however, the Nux decreases at the rate of −0.2689 and −0.0994 via R and Nc, respectively. It is also noted from Table II that the Shx enhances for larger values of Pr, Nbt, R, Nc and Le. The results of the current study are compared with the previously published results of Fang et al. (2012) and Khader and Meghad (2013) under the some limiting conditions and found an excellent agreement as shown in Table III (Figures 21–23).\nTable IV shows the linear regression of Local Nusselt number for the data values of ϵ¼ {0, 0.5, 0.1,…, 1.0} and Nbt¼ {0.5, 0.6, 0.7,…, 2.5}. The R2 value reflects the amount of variance in the dependent variable in question that can be explained by one or more predictor variables by Hair et al. (2011). According to Hair et al. (2011), the acceptable value of R2 as it dependent on research context and model complexity, a cut of point of 0.20 value for R2 is minimum acceptable level. In general, R2 value of 0.75 and above can be interpreted as substantial based on Table IV, it is obvious that model explains 96 percent of the total variance in Local Nusselt number. Therefore, in this study the endogenous latent variable showed acceptable level of R2 value. From the numerical computation, it came to know that local Nusselt number is highly effected by\nm Fang et al.

When convectional base fluid is combined with nanometer-sized solid particles, e.g., copper, aluminum, silver, gold, silicon nanofluids are formed. The purpose of using nanoparticles in the base fluid is to enhance thermal the conductivity of base fluids. According to Choi (1995), by adding a very small amount of nanoparticles to conventional heat carrier’s fluids, the thermal conductivity can be increased up to two times (approximately).",

For different materials with various extensibility, the plate/sheet thickness may alter as indicated by different profiles. An extending plate/sheet with a changeable thickness can be all the more near the circumstance in practical applications. The present world is surrounded by numerous applications of nanofluids in the field of engineering and technology. The conceptualization of these fluids is in much practice in the field of biomedical and food security. Moreover, these fluids are employed as cooling of a nuclear reactor, in the aerodynamic process and in next-generation solar film collector. Choi (1995) was first one who introduced the theory of nanofluids. When convectional base fluid is combined with nanometer-sized solid particles, e.g., copper, aluminum, silver, gold, silicon nanofluids are formed. The purpose of using nanoparticles in the base fluid is to enhance thermal the conductivity of base fluids. According to Choi (1995), by adding a very small amount of nanoparticles to conventional heat carrier’s fluids, the thermal conductivity can be increased up to two times (approximately). Choi (1995) analyzed thermal conductivity of nanofluids in which nanosized copper particles added, the result showed heat transfer enhancement as a function of thermal conductivity.",

    "abstractText" : "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present an exploration of multiple slips and temperature dependent thermal conductivity effects on the flow of nano Williamson fluid over a slendering stretching plate in the presence of Joule and viscous heating aspects. The effectiveness of nanoparticles is deliberated by considering Brownian moment and thermophoresis slip mechanisms. The effects of magnetism and radiative heat are also deployed. Design/methodology/approach – The governing partial differential equations are non-dimensionalized and reduced to multi-degree ordinary differential equations via suitable similarity variables. The subsequent non-linear problem treated for numerical results. To measure the amount of increase/decrease in skin friction coefficient, Nusselt number and Sherwood number, the slope of linear regression line through the data points are calculated. Statistical approach is implemented to analyze the heat transfer rate. Findings – The results show that temperature distribution across the flow decreases with thermal conductivity parameter. The maximum friction factor is ascertained at stronger magnetic field. Originality/value – In the current paper, the magneto-nano Williamson fluid flow inspired by a stretching sheet of variable thickness is examined numerically. The rationale of the present study is to generalize the studies of Mebarek-Oudina and Makinde (2018) and Williamson (1929).",
