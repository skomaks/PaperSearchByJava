A wide range of microorganisms coexist in a normal balance with human body and living environments, but a quick and uncontrolled fast thriving of microbes can lead to some serious problems. Several antimicrobial agents have been used for growth inhibition or killing of microbial population for several years. Some of the used antimicrobial agents have no effectiveness against microbes because of microbial resistance to them that result from using them over time or overdosing. Hence, we need to use new and more effective antimicrobial agents. With developing nanotechnology that leads to the production of nanomaterial's, nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the most effective agents to resolve the problem of microbial resistance. The present review aimed to further introduce the application of nanomaterials.\n*Address correspondence to these authors at the Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Health, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; Tel: 989188594084+; E-mail: hoo.hosseini@gmail.com ** King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, P.O.

Outbreaks caused by pathogenic bacteria because of their resistance to common antibacterial agents, lack of suitable and effective antimicrobial agents, particularly in the undeveloped and developing countries, and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) or nosocomial infections are the most important health issues that demand discovering new and effective antibacterial agents, at a global level [3-5].\nShort Comment A useful way, which has been developed by WHO, to get more comprehensive information for laboratory-based surveillance of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance is to use WHONET. By using this free software we can find the resistance bacteria and use them to study new antibacterial agents. In general, by the software we can use laboratory data in more applicable way and use national or, even international data to find resistant bacteria. WHONET capability can enable: • The representation of the local epidemiology of microbial\npopulations;\n1875-5453/17 $58.00+.00 © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers\n• The choice of antimicrobial agents; • The identification of hospital and community outbreaks; and • The recognition of quality assurance problems in laboratory\ntesting. For more information about the software you can see these references [6-8]. The past century has witnessed rapid advances in scientific knowledge and in the development of medicines, health technologies, and interventions, and individuals who enter healthcare professions can dedicate their lives to the alleviation of suffering and maintenance of life [5]. However, these advances in healthcare practices pose new infection risks to vulnerable patient populations [9]. Surgeries and catheters disrupt protective skin surfaces; chemotherapeutics and immune system suppressors compromise the host’s immunological system; and prolonged periods of immobilization lead to pneumonia and infected bedsores. Individuals admitted to a hospital for the management of hypertension or diabetes may die from multidrug-resistant infections acquired in the hospital. Thus, unfortunately, our efforts to save lives perversely can increase the patient suffering and risk of death through the acquisition of healthcare-associated infections [5, 10, 11]. There will always be risks associated with medical interventions–surgical wound infections, bloodstream infections, pneumonias, urine infections, and many others. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease, to whatever degree possible, the likelihood of such complications through sustained attention to evidence-based hygiene and disease prevention measures, including the sterilization of medical equipment, decreasing the length of exposure to catheters and respirators, vigilance to early signs of infections [11]. Antibacterial resistance to common chemical antibacterial agents can be due to long production-consumption cycle, thereby reducing their efficiency, and use of poor quality or fake medicines in undeveloped and developing countries. NPs as an antimicrobial agent have become the new approach against this challenge, which can establish an effective nanostructure to deliver the antimicrobial agent for targeting the bacterial community efficiently; in addition, they are so potent that microbial pathogens cannot develop resistance to them. However, over the present decade, several studies have suggested that NPs are excellent antibacterial agents, at least at the research level [2, 3, 12]. Generally, nanotechnology is a scientific and engineering technology conducted at the nanoscale, i.e., at approximately 1-100 nm, such as in the fields of compound fabric manufacturing, food processing, agricultural processing, and engineering, as well as in medical and medicinal applications [12-14]. By reducing or developing at the nanometer level, which results in larger surface-area-tovolume ratio, new properties and functions could be developed in the material, such as a change in their chemical, mechanical, electrical, structural, morphological, and optical properties, which would enhance the physicochemical or biological activity, practicality, and possible new phenomena. The functionalities of nanomaterials allow their use in several areas such as biosensors, nanomedicine, and bio-nanotechnology [13, 15]. To have an effective review research, the target articles were extracted from Google Scholar, Scopus, Medline, and other academic databases between the time periods of 1996 and 2016. Nanotechnology is a scientific and engineering technology conducted at the Nano-scale, such as in the fields of compound fabric manufacturing, food and agricultural, and engineering, as well as in medical and medicinal application. In recent decade, nanomaterial applications for antimicrobial works have been interested by many researchers. Available reports show that some of the metal oxide NPs including; Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CuO, Co3O4, In2O3, MgO, SiO2, ZrO2, Cr2O3, Ni2O3, Mn2O3, CoO, and Nickel oxide have toxicity toward several microorganisms and they could successfully kill numerous bacteria. Based on our literature review there are some\neffective factors that can influence the ability of nanomaterial in reducing or killing the cells, and there are mechanisms for nanomaterial against bacteria, which are briefly listed as follows: surface charge of the metal nanomaterial, shape, type and material, concentration of nanomaterial, dispersion and contact of nanomaterial to the bacterial cell, presence of active oxygen, liberation of antimicrobial ions, medium components and pH, physicochemical properties, specific surface-area-to-volume ratios, size, role of growth rate, role of biofilm formation, cell wall of bacteria, and effect of UV illumination. It can be considered that in the use of nanomaterial as antimicrobial agents, consideration of the many factors is in principal. Antibacterial resistance to common chemical antibacterial agents can be due to long production–consumption cycle, thereby reducing their efficiency, and use of poor quality or fake medicines in undeveloped and developing countries. NPs as an antimicrobial agent have become the new approach against this challenge, which can establish an effective nanostructure to deliver the antimicrobial agent for targeting the bacterial community efficiently; in addition, they are so potent that microbial pathogens cannot develop resistance to them. On the other hand, most of the metal oxides NPs have no toxicity toward humans at effective concentrations used to kill bacterial cells, which thus becomes an advantage for using them in a full scale. However, over the present decade, several studies have suggested that NPs are excellent antibacterial agents, at least at the research level. Although metal NPs have various synthesizing methods, all the metal NPs show significant crystallinity, high surface area, and reactive surfaces. In the emerging field of nanotechnology, the goal is to create nanostructures or nano-arrays with special characteristics with regard to those of bulk or single particle species [14]. Oxide NPs can exhibit unique physical and chemical characteristics from their limited size and a high density of corner or edge surface sites. It is believed that metal oxide NPs display antimicrobial activities [2]. Available reports show that some of the metal oxides NPs (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CuO, Co3O4, In2O3, MgO, SiO2, ZrO2, Cr2O3, Ni2O3, Mn2O3, CoO, and Nickel Oxide NPs) have toxicity toward several microorganisms and they could successfully kill numerous bacteria. Most of the metal oxide NPs have no toxicity toward humans at effective concentrations used to kill bacterial cells, which thus becomes an advantage for using them in a full scale [16]. As seen from Table 1, some nano-antimicrobial agents that have been investigated by researches are listed. Based on the proposed antimicrobial mechanisms of NPs and reported studies, it has been suggested that bacteria are not able to develop antimicrobial resistance to metal NPs [2, 16]. Using NPs as antimicrobial agents has the advantages of low cost and simple preparation, high efficiency, and less time to kill and overcome microbial resistance in comparison to conventional antimicrobial agents [3, 4]. However, development of antimicrobial agents using NPs is considered as the way of the future, which could bring several advantages for those who will be using it, nothing is ever faultless and there will always be pros and cons to everything. The advantages and disadvantages of NPs antimicrobials can be easily enumerated, and some of them are mentioned here:"

      "text" : "Using NPs against bacterial cells as an antimicrobial agent is a new and talented approach, which is an effective and low-cost measure against pathogenic bacterial cells. In brief, the advantages of NP antimicrobial agents are as follows: They can be activated by considering the stimulus for the de-\nsired condition such as engineered to active stimulus in special physicochemical conditions, magnetic field, illumination, temperature, and pH values. Therefore, NPs can be useful in acidic media that reduce the efficiency of conventional chemical antimicrobials.\nNPs can easily penetrate into the bacterial cell. NPs are small with varying sizes and made of different materials; therefore, suitable NPs can be selected that could pass through cell barriers and result in disruption of the cell.\nSide effects of their use can be minimized because of flexible physico-chemical properties of NPs.\nNP antimicrobials with different mechanisms against bacteria are capable of overcoming resistance to convention ones. Antimicrobial resistance may be the result of change or inactivation of the antimicrobial agent by the bacteria, change of the special site of the antibiotic, alteration of a metabolic pathway to avoid the disruptive effect of the antimicrobial agent, and\nreduced accumulation of the antimicrobial agent by minimizing its entry or maximizing clearance from the cell. However, few microbes have the ability to reduce uptake (such as Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 against TiO2 and Al2O3 NPs) or increase efflux of NPs (e.g., Shewanella oneidensis by producing extracellular polymeric substances against Cu NPs) that result in resistance against them."

      "heading" : "Surface Charge of the Metal NPs",
      "text" : "NPs easily bind to the bacterial cell wall with a negative charge, and promote penetration into the membrane, which can result in enhancing NP uptake or attraction toward bacteria that consequently leads to more effectiveness [28-33]. On the other hand, accumulation of the particles on the bacterial surface occurs due to electrostatic force. Zeta potential, along with particle size and chemistry, can be considered as a highly relevant parameter controlling antimicrobial effects. Although Gram-positive (GP) and Gram-negative (GN) bacteria have differences in their membrane structure, most of them have a negative charge. The GN bacteria have a major outer surface membrane components namely lipopolysaccharide followed by a thin layer of peptidoglycan [34, 35]. In addition, the cell wall in GP bacteria is primarily composed of a thick layer of peptidoglycan. It has been proved that the cellular membrane of bacteria has a negative charge due to the presence of carboxyl, phosphate, and amino groups. Hence, the repulsion between bacteria and negatively charged NPs could be resulted from the formation of an electrostatic barrier due to reducing the interaction between the NPs and bacteria. With a reduction in the magnitude of the negatively charged NPs, the antibacterial activity will increase [3, 28, 32, 33]. In addition, the attraction of positively charged NPs to sulfur- and phosphorus-containing proteins of bacteria could be another factor for the dissimilar antibacterial effectiveness of NPs with different surface charges. Surface charge of NPs can be determined by zeta potential analysis using a zeta potential analyzer or pHZPC test. This attraction probably overcomes other factors, such as the size and shape that can influence the bacterial cell death. In order to determine pHZPC, the equilibrium technique was applied in a batch system [3, 36]. This technique is based on the estimation of H+ and OH , which are the ions determining the electric potentials. About 0.1 g of the NP was mixed in the incubator machine with 20 mL of KNO3 solution in a sealed container for 24 h. Primary pH values were adjusted using 0.1 M KOH and HNO3 in the pH range of 2–12. The final pH of the each NPs slurry was measured using the pH meter and their amounts were drawn in the primary pH. They are given as pH values of filtered solutions after equilibration (pHf) with the NP as a function of initial pH values (pHi) of the solution. The cytoplasm, a jelly-like fluid that fills a cell, includes all the cellular components except the nucleus. The functions of this organelle include growth, metabolism, and replication. Consequently, the cytoplasm contains proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, ions,\nsalts and water (approximately 80%). This composition contributes to the electrical conductivity of the cellular structure. Surface modification and functionalization are other factors leading to potential changes in NP antimicrobial activity [37, 38]. Some functionalization can increase the presence of oxygen atoms on NP surface that can lead to more reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the medium. Releasing ions from NPs as a result of NP modification is possible, which consequently increases NP antimicrobial activity through ion toxicity mechanism. In addition, NP modification can lead to increase of the surface area, and thus it is increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio that results in increasing the NP antimicrobial potential. Coating NPs is one of the modification approaches, which may be lead to the presence of more toxic agents or enhances one of the antimicrobial mechanisms of NPs, and also induces surface defects (such as vacancy defects) in the NPs. The mechanical damage on the cell wall results from defects in the corners, edges, and chemistry of NPs. With regard to antimicrobial test, NPs are investigated in a medium that contains water, and most NPs have very low solubility in water that is polar, wherein NP agglomeration or settling may occur [3]. In general, NP agglomeration, precipitation, and non-solubility are the challenges that need to be overcome to use them as additives. These challenges may have reductive effects on NP antimicrobial activity."

      "heading" : "Shape of NPs",
      "text" : "Numerous reports have shown that the antimicrobial potential is under the influence of the shape of NPs [39-41]. Controlling NP shape can be facilitated by the synthesizing method, controlling used solvents and concentration, polymers, and bio-molecules, as well as small molecules such as adsorbed gas, and even atomic species, such as different metal ions, precursor natures, temperature, and pH of preparation condition. The shape of NP may be the result of high atom density (e.g., 111 for nano ZnO) [3]. Different forms of NP such as spherical, rod-shaped, truncated triangular, nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanosphere, nanoneedles, and nanorings have been investigated by researchers [42, 43]. Generally, reported studies have revealed the shape-dependent antimicrobial properties of NPs. Each nanostructure has specific structural, optical, electrical, and physicochemical properties, permitting remarkable applications. Each morphology accounts for a certain mechanism of action. These different morphologies display pronounced antibacterial effect toward the targeted bacteria. In the oxide form of metallic NPs (such as ZnO), the O:metal ratio on the surface of NPs can effect ROS generation, which is under the influence of the amount of oxygen atoms on the NP surface and also dependent on the shape of NPs [3]."

      "heading" : "Type and Material of NPs",
      "text" : "The kind of materials used for preparing the NPs is one of important parameters that affect the resultant antimicrobial effectiveness. The toxicity of parent heavy metals of metal oxide NPs can have a high impact on their antimicrobial activity [2]. Each mechanism is predominant by the type of NPs. For example, Ag NP can disrupt bacteria as a result of outer membrane damage. In addition, killing of the bacterial cell is possible due to disruption of metabolic processes, which is caused by interaction of released Ag ion with disulfide or sulfhydryl groups of enzymes. While in the case of ZnO NPs, ROS generation on the surface of the particles, zinc ion release, membrane dysfunction, NP internalization, and surface charge of NPs are the primary routes of ZnO NP interaction with bacteria cells [4, 34]. In addition, the antibacterial activity of Au NPs is due to binding of NPs to the outer membrane of the bacterial cell, which results in ATP decrease, as well as inhibition of tRNA binding to the ribosome [42]."

In addition, higher NP concentrations imply the higher surface area, which result in potential NP antimicrobial activity, as mentioned earlier. Generally, different NP concentrations contribute to the variation in antimicrobial results."

NPs by contacting with bacteria can cause cell wall disruption by internalizing bacteria that can lead to inhibition of energy metabolism. Direct contact of ZnO-NPs with cell walls results in destruction of bacterial cell integrity [3, 34, 37]. The physical presence of a NP most likely disrupts cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner. In this way, NPs assemble in the cytoplasmic zone or in the periplasmic space, thus disrupting the cellular activities and resulting in membrane disturbance and disorder."

      "heading" : "Presence of Active Oxygen",
      "text" : "One of the other effectiveness factors for the antibacterial activity is the presence of active oxygen on the surface of NPs. Some NPs such as CaO and MgO have superoxide on their surface due to hydration with water content of the medium[2, 16]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is highly reactive and oxidizing, which leads to toxicity to bacteria. One of the possible mechanisms reported in several studies for the NP antibacterial activities of various metal oxides is ROS generation [42, 43]. By internalizing ROS species into the bacterial cells, destructive effects on cellular components (lipids, DNA, proteins, etc.) can occur. In addition, autoxidation of NADH dehydrogenase II in the respiratory system may occur as a result of ROSs. It may be due to peroxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipid constituent of the lipid membrane. Superoxide anion (O22 ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxide (OH ) are some common ROS species that are located on NPs. ROS and the other mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of the metal NPs is shown in Fig. (1). Accordingly, it has been found that the ROS is one of the main bactericides mechanisms.\n•OH and •O2 have negative charges that repulse interaction with the bacteria cell wall that cannot penetrate into the membrane.

It may be related to the inhibition of transportation in the bacterial cell membrane, as well as dysfunction or poisoning of amino acids and consequently the enzyme system [3, 37]. On the other hand, NPs with low-ion realization can lead to bacterial resistance to the ions, and hence determination of the released ions from used NPs in all antimicrobial studies of NPs is a necessity. Besides releasing ions, ion species and the ion with the medium origin are also very important. Several researchers have believed that stabilized or insoluble NPs have limited antimicrobial ability because of no or low releasing ions into the medium. The pH of medium is an effective factor than can facilitate the release of ions from NPs. Ion releasing from NPs enhances in an acidic environment. Some studies such as that by Peng et al. have shown that release of ions from NPs is morphology dependent. They concluded that release of Zn2+\nFig. (1).

It is believed that as the pH decreases to acidic range, the releasing ions from NPs as well as amino acids and peptides from bacteria increase due to dissolving NPs and consequently the antimicrobial potential of NPs will be enhanced. Unlike in alkaline pH, the antimicrobial potential of NPs decrease; the opposite is also true, i.e., with changing pH from neutral to alkaline, the bacteriostatic activity becomes better due to changing of NP morphology. It may be because the pH shifting of the medium has no considerable effect on the antimicrobial potential of NPs, but by influencing other effective parameters of both NPs and biological components, it leads to alteration of NP antimicrobial activity indirectly. In addition, because of the presence of negative charge of the bacterial cell wall, attraction of NPs with a positive charge on bacteria is electrostatic. The pH of a solution represents the concentration of hydrogen ions, and thus by changing the pH, the surface charge of NPs will be changed."

Smaller particles are found to have greater antibacterial activity and are shown to have two benefits: i They can easily reach the nuclear content of bacteria due to the\nstructure of the bacterial cell wall, especially in GN ones. ii They can provide a greater surface area and therefore stronger\nbactericidal interactions. Some studies revealed that NPs greater than 10 nm accumulate on the cellular surface and compromise cellular permeability; however, NPs <10 nm penetrate into the bacteria, disturbing the DNA and enzymes, and consequently leading to cellular death."

In planktonic cultures and biofilms with an increasing growth rate, susceptibility to antimicrobial agent increases. In biofilms due to slow growth rate of bacteria, resistance mechanisms against NPs and other antimicrobial agent develop.\nWhen the growth and dying rates are equal, i.e., in stationary phase, susceptibility to NPs is minimum. Furthermore, slow-growing bacteria with tolerance ability (due to expression of stress-response genes) against NPs are more resistant than fast-growing ones. However, the nature of different qualitative NPs can lead to reverse results. Until now, in many cases, the relation between NP susceptibility and bacterial physiology is uncertain. It is possible that NPs with irreversible binding have more toxicity in slow-growing bacteria, whereas fast-growing bacteria have high susceptibility to NPs with reversible binding. An antibacterial agent is considered as bactericidal if it kills the bacteria or as bacteriostatic if it inhibits their growth."

A biofilm is an accumulation of surface-attached microbial cells that are placed in an extracellular polymeric substance matrix. Biofilms can be formed by a single bacterial species, although biofilms more often consist of many species of bacteria, as well as algae, fungi, protozoa, corrosion products, and debris. Essentially, a biofilm may form onto the each surface exposed to bacteria when some amount of water is existed. In chronic infection, the biofilm formation is a considerable problem because the bacteria in the biofilm would be protected against antimicrobial agents. Effectiveness of antibacterial activity of NPs on the biofilm depends on NPs attracting to the biofilm, which is performed electrostatically. Electrostatic attraction of NPs on bacteria has been discussed in the former section. By up taking NPs on the biofilm, new cell formation on the biofilm is inhibited because of toxic effects of NPs on bacteria, and biofilm presence will be depleted or resistance ability develops."

      "heading" : "Cell Wall of Bacteria",
      "text" : "The shape of bacteria, rigidity of the bacterial cell wall, rupturing of cell membrane as a result of osmotic or mechanical pressure are dependent on the bacterial cell wall. One of the methods of bacterial classification based on structural differences in their cell walls is the Gram staining technique (developed by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram) [44]. GP (+) and GN ( ) are two classes of Gram division. In Gram’s test, GP bacteria that have of a thick layer of 20–50 nm peptidoglycan can hold the crystal violet dye, while GN cell walls with more complexity do not hold the violet dye and the result of staining is red or pink color. Comparison of the characteristics of GP and GN bacteria is briefly presented in Table 2. In general, including NPs, the structure of the bacterial cell wall is one of the primary causes of resistance or susceptibility of bacteria to NPs. It is believed that peptidoglycan is able to pass through the NPs because of the small size. Because of the presence of lipopolysaccharides, the negative charge on GN bacteria enhances; therefore, the effect of surface charge (both bacteria and NPs) would be a limiting factor of NP effect on the bacteria. Additionally, diffusion of NPs inside the biofilm matrix is affected by the bacterial cell wall. For example, the GN bacteria have resistance to hydrophobic antimicrobial agents. However, bacterial susceptibility to NPs is not related solely to bacteria cell wall. It may be affected by factors related to NPs (such as NP type), resulting in increase or decrease of the antimicrobial potential. It should be noted that the anchored cell wall proteinase PrtP on the microbial surface can alter the physico-chemical properties of the bacterial cell wall and result in hydrophilic to an extremely hydrophobic characteristic. It can be decreased by attracting NPs onto the cell wall or vice versa. Based on the available results on the antimicrobial NPs, the GN bacteria are resistant to ZnO-NPs in comparison with the GP ones, while Ag NPs have better effectiveness against GN bacteria."

      "text" : "Some NPs such as ZnO have high photocatalytic activity, and their electrical conductivity increases due to UV absorbance [41, 45, 46]. Better conductivity property of NPs can enhance the electrostatic attraction of NPs to bacteria. In addition, due to interaction of UV with H2O molecules, it is assumed that O2 and O22 are produced and are left on the NP surface and can enhance the ROS mechanism. Metallic NPs by receiving photons with enough energy to move electrons from the valence band to the conduction band will be induced [47]. Electron transfer between the bands leads to photoreactions, including holes with a positive charge creation. These holes with the following three pathways can increase the NP antimicrobial activity [41, 45, 46]: 1). Direct oxidation of bacteria 2). Formation of reactive OH•\n3). H2O2 production"

      "heading" : "CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "It can be considered that in the use of nanomaterial as antimicrobial agents, consideration to many factor is in principal. Antibac-\nterial resistance to common chemical antibacterial agents can be due to long production-consumption cycle, thereby reducing their efficiency, and use of poor quality or fake medicines in undeveloped and developing countries. NPs as an antimicrobial agent have become the new approach against this challenge, which can establish an effective nanostructure to deliver the antimicrobial agent for targeting the bacterial community efficiently; in addition, they are so potent that microbial pathogens cannot develop resistance to them. On the other hand, most of the metal oxides NPs have no toxicity toward humans at effective concentrations used to kill bacterial cells, which thus becomes an advantage for using them in a full scale. However, over the present decade, several studies have suggested that NPs are excellent antibacterial agents, at least at the research level."
