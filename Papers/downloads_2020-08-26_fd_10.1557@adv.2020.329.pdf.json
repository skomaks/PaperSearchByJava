The combination of the UNCD coating with the CMNS metal surface treatment provides a transformational process to produce a new generation of metallic implants.

It is demonstrated that the CMNS process in the presence of an oxidizer (1M to be optimal) induces a tailored interface to promote UNCD coating capability through effective interface passivation leading to uniform surface coverage. The final implant product is observed to have improved corrosion potential and enhanced hydrophobicity indicating better biocompatibility providing the basis for a new generation of superior DIs. The findings can further be extended to the hip, knee, and other orthopedic metallic implants, which require major performance improvements, particularly in reducing or eliminating in-vivo body fluid-induced chemical corrosion."

      "text" : "Chemical Mechanical Nano-structuring (CMNS) is a new technique that can\nbe used to induce nano-scale surface roughness on surfaces of metal-based implantable prostheses [1]. The CMNS process on titanium (Ti) or Ti-alloy surfaces of prostheses provides a synergistic chemical and mechanical surface treatment, resulting in a combination of effects, namely: (i) cleaning the implant surface from potentially contaminated surface layers of machining by removing a nano-scale top layer during the process, (ii) creating a non-porous-continuous nano-scale oxide film on the surface to limit further contamination [2], to minimize risk of infection when implanted in the human body, and (iii) induce controlled surface roughness by designing the CMNS process variables such as slurry particle size, solids loading, oxidizer type and concentration [1]. The UNCD films, with grain sizes in the range of 3-5nm, were shown to exhibit excellent biocompatibility [3], when used to encapsulate a silicon (Si)-based microchip device implantable inside the eye [4] to restore partial vision for people who are blind due to genetically induced degeneration of their photoreceptors. In addition to biocompatibility, UNCD coatings exhibit a unique set of complementary properties relevant to the results described in this paper. Initially, UNCD generates smoother surface (~3-5 nm rms roughness) as compared to micrometer ranges achieved by microcrystalline diamond (MCD) (≥ 1 µm grain size) and high nanometer range for nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) (10-100 nm grain size) coatings, thus making the UNCD coating extremely hermetic for thickness in the range 200-300 nm. It has been shown by UNCDcoated Si microchips [4], [5], as part of the Argus II device developed for implantation inside the human eye (to restore partial vision to people blinded by retinitis pigmentosa) that UNCD provides superior nanometer range thickness hermeticity as compared to the much thicker MCD or NCD films required for similar hermeticity to be obtained. Furthermore, the fact that the 200 nm thick UNCD films can be grown in 30-50 minutes as compared to the timeframe of hours for the thicker MCD or NCD films ensures cost efficiency. Finally, the superior conformal growth of UNCD on 3-D structures, such as screw-type dental implants at ~200 nm thickness [4], as compared to thicker MCD or NCD coatings, provide superior protection of the coated metal-based DI from chemical attack by oral fluids, due to the extreme resistance of UNCD coating to chemical attack by any corrosive fluids and its superior hermeticity [4], [5], [6].\nThe research outcomes reported in this paper show that the CMNS process can\nbe effectively implemented to tailor the surface chemistry and roughness of Ti implants to promote the continuous growth of biocompatible/corrosion resistant UNCD coatings.

The presence of oxidizer in CMNS process helps promote a denser and continuous protective oxide film formation on the titanium surface [2], and the mechanical action of the abrasive particles modulate the surface roughness on which the UNCD is deposited. The UNCD coating on CMNS processed Ti surfaces were also tested electrochemically in a solution simulating the oral fluid environment, to test the resistance performance of the bare titanium, only CMNS processed surfaces as well as the CMNS/UNCD combination against corrosion by oral fluids. Furthermore, preliminary biocompatibility evaluations were conducted by surface wettability testing post CMNS and post UNCD treatments to observe the potential improvement in cell attachment that drives the fixation ability of the dental implants in the maxillary bone. The osteoblast cell growth on the surface of UNCD coatings has been demonstrated to be promoted by increased hydrophobicity in earlier findings [6], [7], [8], which remains parallel to the observations on the CMNS/UNCD film combinations."

      "text" : "Extensive research conducted by many independent groups have shown the\nchemical degradation and biologically poor performances of uncoated Ti or Ti-alloy based dental implants [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. In this study, pure titanium coupons were used the implement chemical mechanical nano-structuring in the absence and presence of an oxidizer at varying concentrations in the polishing slurry and compared to a titanium coupon with no treatment as a baseline material. The CMNS process was implemented on 1.5x1.5 cm2 square shape bulk Ti coupons with 99.9% purity and 1mm thickness. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as the oxidizer in silica based commercial polishing slurry with 3wt% solids loading. Oxidizer was added at 0, 0.3, 1 and 1.6 M concentrations and a Polytex buff pad was used with the polishing settings as described in detail in previous publication [1]. The surface roughness values were measured post CMNS by Atomic Force Microscopy on 10x10mm scans and reported as root mean square (RMS) average of minimum three scans per sample.\nThe Ti coupons pre-treated with CMNS as a function of the oxidizer\nconcentration were seeded with diamond nanoparticles (3-5 nm diameter), via immersion in a diamond nanoparticles/methanol solution in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes followed by four steps of solvent based washing for 1 to 5 minutes. The sound waves help insert the diamond nanoparticles onto the Ti surface, and post cleaning removes residues of the seeding solution. The diamond nanoparticles immersed on the surface act as seeds inducing the nucleation and growth of UNCD coatings [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Subsequently, the diamond seeded Ti samples were inserted in a Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (MPCVD) system to grow the UNCD coating.\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 15\n57 /a\ndv .2\n02 0.\n32 9\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh tt\nps ://\nw w\nw .c\nam br\nid ge\n.o rg\n/c or\ne.

Gamry Echem cell setup.\nThe UNCD-MPCVD growth process involves flowing an Argon-rich gas\nmixture [Ar (99%)/CH4 (1%)] in an air evacuated chamber, where microwave power is coupled to break the CH4 molecules into CHx (x=1,2,3) radicals. The Ar ions, produced in\nthe plasma, collide with the radicals to produce C2 dimers, which synergistically with the CHx radicals induce the nucleation and growth of the UNCD coating [6]. A new method, bias enhanced nucleation-bias enhanced growth (BEN-BEG), whereby a negative voltage applied to the metal surface is capable of inducing acceleration of positively charged C+ and CH+ ions, with low energies (50-200 eV), resulting in ions insertion on the metal surface, inducing chemical reactions of C ions with Ti atoms to produce TiC layers, which nucleate the UNCD films, for subsequent growth [16], [17].\nThe surface morphology of\nthe samples treated with CMNS and further coated with UNCD were characterized by using a ZEISS\nSUPRA-40 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The C atoms chemical bonding in the UNCD coatings were also characterized via Raman spectroscopy by using a Thermo DXR Raman Spectrometer with a 532 nm wavelength laser beam.\nElectrochemical potentiodynamic-based tests were conducted in oral fluid\nsimulated environment on Ti samples, after CMNS treatment as a function of the oxidizer concentration as well as after UNCD coating. The samples were dipped in a 100 ml triple distilled de-ionized water (DI) water (Resistivity of 18.1 M.cm) aerated solution, maintained at 36  1˚C. A Gamry Flat specimen holder was used to maintain consistency in exposed sample surface area (circular area with 1 cm diameter) and electrochemical response. Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) connected with a Luggin capillary, and a 26-gauge thick Platinum wire (99.90% Pure) served as the reference and the counter electrodes, respectively. Measurements were recorded by using a Gamry reference 3000 potentiostat system and the dedicated Gamry Echem Analyst software. After a duration of 1-h open circuit potential (Eoc) stabilization, potentiostatic transients at 0  100 µV were collected for 10 mins for each specimen. Followed by a 10 mins delay, potentiodynamic polarization curves were also recorded from -1V up to +2V from Eoc, with a scan rate of 10mV/min. Following the electrochemical testing, samples were rinsed in running DI water and flushed with dry hot air until completely dry. The wettability responses of the titanium coupons treated with CMNS and UNCD were determined through contact angle measurements by using a Rame-hart Goniometer using DI water droplets as a representation of biocompatibility as demonstrated in our earlier work [1].\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 15\n57 /a\ndv .2\n02 0.\n32 9\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh tt\nps ://\nw w\nw .c\nam br\nid ge\n.o rg\n/c or\ne.

      "text" : "Fig 2 shows the SEM micrographs of the Ti coupons pre-treated by CMNS at\n0, 0.3, 1 and 1.6 M H2O2 concentrations and coated by UNCD. It can be observed that there is a difference in morphology and uniformity of the deposition with the variation of the oxidizer concentration used during the CMNS processing step. In the absence of oxidizer during the CMNS processing (Fig. 2a), the naturally forming titanium oxide film is removed completely, leaving a bare titanium metal to be exposed with surface roughness recorded to be 18.48  0.79nm based on the AFM measurements. This procedure, in combination with the oxide removal in the CVD plasma deposition seem to result in improper UNCD coating with small island-like surface morphology revealing a patchy surface coverage. As the concentration of the H2O2 is increased to 0.3, 1 and 1.6 M during CMNS process, the UNCD coating became more uniform as can be seen in Figs. 2b through 2d. This can be attributed to the formation of a surface oxide layer in the presence of the oxidizer in the polishing suspensions during the CMNS. In addition, the surface roughness values were observed to be changing after the CMNS treatment in the presence of oxidizer, which were measured as 21.51  2.09nm; 19.21  4.46nm and 1.6 M 4.26  1.42nm in 0.3, 1 and 1.6M H2O2, respectively. This change can be explained based on the nucleation and growth mechanism of titanium oxide on the surface as explained in detail in our earlier studies on nano-scale protective metal oxide nucleation growth mehanisms [18]. While increased surface area by increased roughness can contribute to adhesion of the UNCD, it appears that the quality of oxide is more predominant as the dense oxide layer generated by the CMNS process can also help reduce the oxide etch\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 15\n57 /a\ndv .2\n02 0.\n32 9\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh tt\nps ://\nw w\nw .c\nam br\nid ge\n.o rg\n/c or\ne.

Fig. 3 illustrates the Raman spectra for the samples treated with CMNS (a) and CMNS followed by the UNCD, respectivelly. The disapearance, in the EDS spectra, of the Titanium K peaks, from Fig. 3a to 3b, and the appearance of the carbon \"C\" K peak, in Fig. 3b, after growing the UNCD coatings, confirms the presence of the UNCD film on the surface of the Ti samples. The Raman spectra shown in Fig. 3(c) displays the classic G and D-mode signature peaks. The 1550 cm−1 G band peak is attributed to the sp2 carbon atoms bonds mainly in the grain boundaries [6], [20]. The 1350 cm−1 D band attributed to disorderinduced sp2 carbon atoms bonds, [6], [21], [22]. The 1450 and 1130 cm−1 bands both are attributed to C=C and C-H vibration modes in grain boundaries, respectively, identified with the existence of trans-poly-acetylene molecules [23], [24]. All these Raman bands are due to chemical bonds of carbon atoms in the extensive grain boundary network of the UNCD (grain sizes 3-5 nm [6]) films.\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 15\n57 /a\ndv .2\n02 0.\n32 9\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh tt\nps ://\nw w\nw .c\nam br\nid ge\n.o rg\n/c or\ne.

The polarization curves for Ti coupons treated without an oxidizer and by uusing 0.3, 1 and 1.6 M concentration of H2O2 during CMNS treatment are shown in Fig. 4.\nTable 1 summarizes the corrosion potential (Eoc) values measured pre and post UNCD coating on the titanium coupons treated with CMNS in the absence of oxidizer and after addition of 0.3, 1, and 1.6 M H2O2. The baseline sample, bare Ti coupon with no CMNS treatment has shown a corrosion potential of Eoc at -0.5542 V in DI water at 36.6 C as the baseline sample. As compared to this baseline measurement, each processing step, including the CMNS treatment in the absence of an oxidizer, resulted in an increase in the corrosion potential indicating that the surfaces became more corrosion resistant. The nano-scale modification of the surface through chemical and mechanical polishing in the presence of H2O2 is known to generate an effective passivation layer [1] [2]. The decrease in the corrosion potential at 0.3 M oxidizer concentration can be attributed to the nucleation of the titanium oxide on the surface post CMNS which resulted in an increased\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 15\n57 /a\ndv .2\n02 0.\n32 9\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh tt\nps ://\nw w\nw .c\nam br\nid ge\n.o rg\n/c or\ne.

The best corrosion potential was obtained at 1M concentration indicating an optimal dosage. Furthermore, 1M CMNS treatment has also resulted in the highest corrosion potential measurement post UNCD deposition among all the treatments. While the rougher oxide surface layer may provide more seeding sites for the non-porous UNCD film deposition, in the absence of oxidizer during CMNS (0M H2O2) the corrosion potential was observed to decrease post UNCD deposition. This can be due to the galvanic corrosion taking place in between the UNCD (carbon) islands and the titanium metal surface where the coating is patchy, and the plasma may have stripped the TiO2 layer and produced the TiC nucleation layer. The galvanic corrosion may be induced by the large differences in the reduction potentials of the UNCD and Ti layers, in the galvanic series [25], [26]. The DC anodic linear polarization resistances (LPR) [27] were also calculated from the potentiodynamic curves at +10mV from the Eoc, yet there was not a significant change in the range of what is LPR values (in M.cm2) after CMNS treatment as well as following the UNCD deposition. The calculated values were 0.167, 0.044, 0.093, 0.176 M.cm2 at 0, 0.3, 1 and 1.6 M H2O2 addition, respectively. The values were observed to increase with the increasing oxidizer concentration. These values also validate the changes in the mechanisms of titanium oxide layer formation during CMNS process as a function of the oxidizer concentration. While 1M oxidizer addition is observed to result in the optimal CMNS and UNCD interface and corrosion resistance, further electrochemical analyses in the simulated body fluid or simulated saliva environment will be necessary to understand the in-vivo corrosion behavior in more detail.\nCMNS Treatment H2O2 Concentration\nPre-UNCD Coating Post-UNCD Coating\nEoc vs SCE (V) Eoc vs SCE (V)\n0.0 M -0.2695  0.01 -0.3894  0.024\n0.3 M -0.5293  0.046 -0.3593  0.032\n1.0 M -0.3395  0.028 -0.2695  0.015\n1.6 M -0.3595  0.005 -0.3394  0.01\nCMNS Treatment H2O2 Concentration\nPre-UNCD Coating Post-UNCD Coating\nContact Angle (degrees)\nContact Angle (degrees)\n0.0 M 70.17  4.67 105.33  2.97\n0.3 M 69.55  2.31 110.36  3.88\n1.0 M 70.59  1.34 97.9  1.73\n1.6 M 71.43  4.55 107.97  1.95\nTable I Corrosion potentials acquired from electrochemical tests on Ti coupons in D ater at C pre and post UNCD coating as a function of the CMNS treatment oxidizer concentration.\nTable II Contact angle measurements on Ti coupons pre and post UNCD coating as a function of the CMNS treatment oxidizer concentration.\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 15\n57 /a\ndv .2\n02 0.\n32 9\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\nfr om\nh tt\nps ://\nw w\nw .c\nam br\nid ge\n.o rg\n/c or\ne.

Contact angle measurement is a measure of the surface wettability and it is known that the lower wettability corresponds to a higher surface hydrophobicity which drives cell attachment and hence enhanced biocompatibility [1], [2]. As it can be seen in Table II, the contact angle values were ~70 degrees post CMNS treatment, whereas the UNCD coating has significantly increased the surface hydrophobicity and contact angle values of ~100 degrees were obtained. The significant increase in the surface hydrophobic nature post UNCD is well-aligned with the superior biological response of the UNCD coatings."

      "text" : "Implementation of the novel CMNS process on titanium bio-implants is a\nsynergistic approach for implant surface treatment. Its combination as a pre-treatment to UNCD deposition that is known to be biocompatible and body fluid corrosion resistant has shown to be promoting a continuous deposition through enhanced interface preparation. The preliminary studies demonstrated that the changes in the surface topography and the chemical composition of the Ti metal through the polishing action in the presence of an oxidizer during the CMNS process, affects the UNCD coating quality positively. The electrochemical analyses further showed that the presence of oxidizer during the CMNS treatment promotes the formation of more uniform UNCD coating, enhancing the corrosion resistance particularly at 1M concentration. Further research is needed to understand the behavior of this process methodology on the surface properties towards enhancing biocompatibility by increasing cell attachment, decreasing bacterial growth and eliminating in-vivo Ti4+ ion dissolution from Ti based bio-implants thus demonstrating the synergy in CMNS based UNCD-coating processes for future Ti based prostheses applications."

The combination of the UNCD coating with the CMNS metal surface treatment provides a transformational process to produce a new generation of metallic implants. CMNS promotes a uniform and dense titanium oxide interface and UNCD enables higher resistance to chemical-induced corrosion by oral fluids and enhanced bone attachment due to superior bone cell growth on C atoms (element of life in human DNA and cell). h t t p s : / / d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 1 5 5 7 / a d v . 2 0 2 0 . 3 2 9 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h t t p s : / / w w w . c a m b r i d g e . o r g / c o r e .
