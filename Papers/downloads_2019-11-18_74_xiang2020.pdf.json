      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "As the rapid development of electric vehicles, portable electronic devices and smart grids, the power densities of energy storage systems are required to be enhanced greatly to satisfy the practical demands [1–4]. Among conventional energy storage systems, lithium-ion (Liþ) batteries have been most widely applied due to its high energy density and good cycling stability [5,6]. However, as the charge-discharge rate increases, the performances of Liþ batteries usually decay rapidly, mainly because conventional graphite anodes could not supply effective power capability [7–10]. The conventional graphite anodes have some obvious disadvantages at high rate, such as poor rate performance, high security risk caused by lithium dendrites formation [11,12]. It has been well known that the spinel Li4Ti5O12 would avoid the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and lithium dendrites due to its high platform potential at 1.55 V (vs. Li/Liþ) [10,12]. Besides, Li4Ti5O12 owns good cycle stability because of its zero-strain character. Therefore, Li4Ti5O12 is one of the most attracting anodes for high-rate Liþ batteries [13–15]. However, Li4Ti5O12 owns intrinsic sluggish electrical conductivity and relatively low Liþ diffusion coefficient, so its power capability is not very satisfied for high-rate Liþ batteries [16–18]. In order to improve power capability of Li4Ti5O12, many strategies have been utilized, mainly concentrating on coating a surface conductive layer, synthesizing nanoparticles and designing porous structure [11,19–24]. These strategies could increase the electronic and Liþ conductivity of Li4Ti5O12, leading to remarkedly improved rate performances. Unfortunately, these strategies always introduce excess voids into Li4Ti5O12, resulting in a much low tap density and low volumetric power density [25–28].\nAccording to relative literatures, it is demonstrated that the low tap density of Li4Ti5O12 is mainly caused by excess large pores [27,29]. It is obvious that if without any obstacle between precursor particles, calcination at high temperature is a simple and effective method for eliminating large pores and enhancing tap density. Yan-Bing He synthesized compact Li4Ti5O12 microbars with rich micropores using ammonium bicarbonate as a template through calcination process [30]. The compact Li4Ti5O12 electrode owned a high tap density of 1.2 g cm 3, and displayed a capacity of 129 mA h g 1 at 5.25 A g 1, which is 74% of capacity at 0.0175 A g 1. Similarly, a Li4Ti5O12 microsphere comprised by monodisperse nanoparticles was successfully prepared by Fei-Yu Kang group [31]. After calcined at 750 �C for 7 h, as-prepared Li4Ti5O12 microsphere gets a high tap density of 1.1 g cm 3. Meanwhile, polyvinylpyrrolidone and ammonium bicarbonate were used to produce rich micropores for Liþ diffusion. The Li4Ti5O12 microsphere delivered a specific capacity of 160 mA h g 1 at 0.175 A g 1 and a capacity retention of 60% at 14 A g 1. In order to further enhance tap density of Li4Ti5O12, Zheng et al. prepared a pristine Li4Ti5O12 microsphere with pre-sintered method [32]. The pre-sintered step could release the gas from the decomposition of precursors and is profitable for further decrease the voids in Li4Ti5O12. Finally, the Li4Ti5O12 microsphere achieved a tap density as high as 1.4 g cm 3. Though the above references demonstrated that tap density could be notably improved by calcination treatment, yet the pore size distributions could not be controlled precisely and were attributed to micropore-oriented porous structure, which greatly restricted further improvement of the high-rate performance of Li4Ti5O12.\nIt has been verified that enough mesopores can provide coherent channels for rapid Liþ transportation, which is profitable for high-rate character [9,11,33,34]. Consequently, to combine high tap density and good power capability of Li4Ti5O12, it is necessary to retain enough mesopores while eliminating excess large pores. Therefore, it is required to precisely control porous structure of Li4Ti5O12. It is well known that graphene can be assembled into various conductive and porous frameworks to load nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles, so it is probable to precisely control porous structure of Li4Ti5O12/graphene hybrid material [33,35]. For reference, Quan-Hong Yang group prepared a kind of nanosized tin oxide (SnO2) @graphene composite by capillary drying of graphene\nhydrogels [36]. During the drying process, graphene sheets shrank acutely so that massive large pores are eliminated, leading to enhanced tap density of composite (1 g cm 3 to 2.5 g cm 3). Meanwhile, the in-site deposited nanosized SnO2 particles prevented the aggregation of graphene sheets, resulting in rich mesopores. Generally, the pore structure of SnO2/graphene composite could be precisely controlled by the amounts of precursors. It is indicated that high tap density of Li4Ti5O12/graphene composite with rich mesopores could be achieved by compact assembly of graphene sheets anchored with nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles. However, the compact graphene sheets could severely resist Liþ diffusion and decrease power capabilities of composites [37,38]. Yet, the compact graphene framework could amplify the Liþ diffusion resistance, because Liþ could not shuttle through graphene sheets, which resulted in a poor power capability [39]. Therefore, it is indicated that decreasing the Liþ diffusion resistance from graphene sheets is a key factor for designing compact Li4Ti5O12/graphene composite with good power capability.\nIn this work, a dense and mesopore-oriented holey-graphene framework (HGF) anchored with nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles is successfully synthesized through capillary evaporation process. In sharp contrast to non-hole graphene frameworks (GF), holey graphene owns abundant in-plane pores with diameter about 5 nm. These nanopores could enable Liþ to shuttle graphene sheet and greatly weaken the resistance of Liþ diffusion in the compact Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites, which is essential for achieving good power capability. On the other hand, the porous structure of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite could be precisely controlled by changing the initial ratio of Li4Ti5O12 to HGF. After precisely adjusting porous structure, a balance between mesoporeoriented structure and high tap density is achieved, which is profitable for obtaining good volumetric power capability. Furthermore, Li4Ti5O12 is a kind of zero-strain material, so the compact holey-graphene framework is anticipated to be very stable. As a representative example, a nanosized-Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite (LTO/HGF-1) combines a high tap density of 1.1 g cm 3 and a moderate mesopore-oriented structure with a high specific surface area of 154.2 m2 g 1. Due to the well-designed structure, LTO/HGF-1 displays an excellent volumetric power capability, which delivers a volumetric-specific capacity of 98 mA h cm 3 at 17.5 A g 1 with a capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles at 7A g 1, showing good ultrahigh-rate performances and long cycle stability."

      "text" : "To obtain high tap density, a capillary evaporation drying process was applied as shown in Fig. 1. The process is just to evaporate solvent completely at a high temperature and is very easy to be controlled. In the preparation of blank LTO shown in Fig. 1a, Li4Ti5O12 precursor particles agglomerate together to form larger clusters. Obviously, there are almost no pores in these clusters, resulting in a high tap density for blank LTO. However, due to lack of pores, the Liþ diffusion resistance in blank LTO is likely to be very high. Hence, it is inferred that the high rate performance of blank LTO would be poor. As revealed in Fig. 1b, the tap density of Li4Ti5O12/GF composite increases due to the elimination of large pores after fiercely shrunk. Meanwhile, the in-site deposited Li4Ti5O12 precursor nanoparticles prevent graphene sheets aggregating together and reserve plenty of mesopores. These mesopores could provide channels for Liþ diffusion. However, Liþ cannot pass through graphene sheets, which may restrict the high rate performance of Li4Ti5O12/GF composite. To combine high tap density and good high rate performances, HGO is used to prepare Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite as shown in Fig. 1c. The tap density of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite has also been enhanced in shrinkage step. In addition of the mesopores between graphene sheets, the in-plane pores of holey graphene sheets also support Liþ diffusion, which obviously weakens the resistance from graphene sheets and is very profitable for high rate performance. Based on the above analysis results, it could be predicted that Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite may simultaneously possess high tap density and superior power capability.\nIn this work, HGO with nanopores uniformly distributed in plane is applied for synthesizing nanosized-Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite. The TEM image of HGO in Fig. 2a reveals plentiful in-plane nanopores with sizes of 5 nm which penetrate graphene sheet. Judging from the TEM of HGF in Fig. 2b, the in-plane nanopores could also be observed even under the condition of severe aggregation of graphene sheets. These in-plane nanopores provide channels for electrolyte transportation and ions diffusion, which is benefic to weaken the resistance of Liþ diffusion.\nFrom the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2c, it is found except spinel Li4Ti5O12, no obvious impurity in LTO/HGF-1. However, the other Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites (shown in Fig. S1) all have TiO2 phase. It is generally thought that TiO2 originates from incompletely mixing of Li and Ti sources in preparation process [41]. Hence, the existences of TiO2 reflect that the substance transportation processes of LTO/HGF-2.5, LTO/HGF-1.75, LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 are resisted. It is also indicated that the porous structure of LTO/HGF-1 is likely to be different from other Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites and benefic to ion transportation. To some extent, the pure Li4Ti5O12 phase of blank LTO testifies the above opinion and indicates the transportation resistance is closely relative to graphene sheets. Furthermore, the Li4Ti5O12 particle size in all Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites could also be assessed from half peak width of XRD results. According to the Scherrer equation, the grain size is higher with narrower peak width. Based on the peak width listed in Table S1, it is shown that the grain size gradually diminishes as the content of HGO increases, which indicates the particle size may also decrease. Raman results in Fig. 2d show the characteristic Raman bands of spinel Li4Ti5O12 at 237, 347, 420, and 679 cm 1 in blank LTO and LTO/HGF-1 [19,42]. Moreover, the Raman results of all Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites (in Fig. S2) show not only the bands of Li4Ti5O12, but also the expected D and G bands of reduced GO.\nSEM images in Fig. 3a–f clearly demonstrate the influence of HGO content on the morphology of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites. For blank LTO (Fig. 3a), substantial Li4Ti5O12 particles assemble to a compact solid without any pores. In Fig. 3b–f, it is obvious that Li4Ti5O12 particles are in-site deposited on dense layered graphene sheets. Additionally, these SEM images reflect that with more HGO added in initial, the sizes of Li4Ti5O12 particles are smaller and the dense state of Li4Ti5O12/HGF\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\ncomposites become much clearer. The HRTEM images in Fig. 4a–f further show the size change trend of Li4Ti5O12 particles with the increase amounts of HGO in original. As the amounts of HGO gradually increase, the sizes of Li4Ti5O12 particles decrease from about 250 nm (LTO/HGF-2.5) to only 7 nm (LTO/HGF-0.1), which is consistent with that determined from XRD results. Moreover, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. S2 evolve from scatted points to continuous circles, also demonstrating that the size distributions of Li4Ti5O12 particles gradually become uniform and smaller. Additionally,\nthe zoomed pictures in red panes are ascribed to the (111) plane of spinel Li4Ti5O12, demonstrating good crystallinity.\nN2 adsorption/desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 5a. It is revealed that blank LTO and HGF are both attributed to I type Langmuir Isotherms, which indicate nearly no any pore in the two samples. Because of non-porous character, the specific surface area of blank LTO and HGF are separately only 11.2 m2 g 1 and 5.3 m2 g 1 (shown in Table S2). Table S2 also shows that the BET specific areas of Li4Ti5O12/ HGF composites range from 122.6 to 158.1 m2 g 1. The Li4Ti5O12/HGF\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\ncomposites all possess typical IV type isotherms but with different kinds of hysteresis loops. H3 type hysteresis loops in both LTO/HGF-2.5 and LTO/HGF-1.25 demonstrate the dispersive pore size distributions, indicating abundant larger mesopores in these composites. In contrast, LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 both own H4 type hysteresis loops which reveal the two porous structures are mainly constituted by micropores and smaller mesopores. It is most distinct that the hysteresis loop of LTO/HGF-1 is attributed to H2 type, which reflects uniformly distributed mesopores. The density functional theory (DFT) results further demonstrate the pore size distribution trends of all samples, which are consistent with the analysis from hysteresis loops. It is shown in Fig. 5b that blank LTO and HGF have no any pore. Besides, the pore size distributions of LTO/HGF-2.5 and LTO/HGF-1.75 range from 2 nm to 45 nm, showing much disperse pore distribution. LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 both show two concentrated distributions at micropore (�2 nm) and smaller mesopore (�6 nm) regions. Furthermore, the DFT analysis of LTO/HGF-1 indicates that the prominent pore size is concentrated from 5 nm to 10 nm. For blank LTO or HGF, it is easy to\nunderstand that Li4Ti5O12 particles or graphene sheets shrink into a dense solid in the evaporation drying process, resulting that the both isotherms belong to Langmuir type. However, the different porous structures of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites are caused by the various sizes of Li4Ti5O12 particles, as shown in Schema 1. TEM images have revealed the Li4Ti5O12 particles in LTO/HGF-2.5 and LTO/HGF-1.75 are not homogeneous and its sizes exceed 0.2 μm. Therefore, the reserved pores between graphene sheets are attributed to larger mesopores and distributed dispersedly (as Schema 1a). In LTO/HGF-1, the Li4Ti5O12 particles become uniform and its sizes concentrate at about 20 nm, which makes the voids between particles distributing uniformly and finally achieves a moderate mesopore-oriented structure concentrating at 5 nm–10 nm (as Schema 1b). However, because the particle sizes in LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 are only about 10 nm, the shrinkage effects of graphene sheets are much severe, resulting that the pore size distributions are not only concentrated at smaller mesopores but also at micropores as shown in Schema 1c.\nAs illustrated in Schema. 1, the shrinkage of graphene sheets\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\neliminates large pores and retains mesopores between graphene sheets It is easy to understand that mesopores between graphene sheets have also influence on tap densities of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites. In general, lower specific volume may achieve higher tap density. Fig. 5c shows that the specific volumes of blank LTO and pure HGF are nearly zero due to both solid characters. However, the specific volumes of LTO/HGF composites gradually decreases with lower amounts of HGO. The tap densities of blank LTO, Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites and HGF are shown in Fig. 5d. Among all the samples, blank LTO has the highest tap density of about 1.4 g cm 3, which is equivalent to the highest reported value [29,30,43]. It is evident that voids are introduced as compositing with graphene, which leads to reduce tap density. Hence, the tap densities of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites are all smaller than that of blank LTO. However, as the ratio of HGO increases in initial, the porosity gradually develops from dispersive larger mesopores into concentrated moderate mesopores, so the tap densities increases from only 0.6 g cm 3 (LTO/HGF-2.5) to �1.1 g cm 3 (LTO/HGF-1). As the amounts of HGO further increase, though the porosity continues to shrink, yet the tap densities of composites began to decrease due to the much low density of\nHGF (�0.4 g cm 3). The tap densities of LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 are 0.7 g cm 3 and 0.6 g cm 3, respectively. Hence, among these Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites, LTO/HGF-1 has the highest tap density. Moreover, LTO/HGF-1 also has the highest BET specific area of 158.1 m2 g 1 due to its uniform and moderate mesopore-oriented structure. Though the tap density of LTO/HGF-1 is still a little lower than blank LTO, yet it is demonstrated that a successful trade-off between tap density and mesopore-oriented structure could be achieved by precisely adjusting the porous architecture.\nBased on the above analysis, if HGO is replaced by ordinary GO, LTO/GF (synthesized at the same original weight ratio of LTO to GO of 1:1) will also achieve similar porous structure and tap density with LTO/ HGF-1. The SEM and TEM images of LTO/GF in Fig. S3 reveal that the morphology character is similar with LTO/HGF-1, such as dense layered graphene sheets and uniform nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles on graphene sheets. Furthermore, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of LTO/GF in Fig. S3 is almost the same to LTO/HGF-1. The pore size distribution of LTO/GF is also concentrated at moderate mesopore range (7 nm–12 nm) and its BET specific area is 165 m2 g 1 which are both equivalent to\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\nLTO/HGF-1. Besides, the tap density of LTO/GF is as much as 1.2 g cm 3, which is a bit higher than LTO/HGF-1. However, the XRD result in Fig. S3 demonstrates that there is impurity TiO2 phase in LTO/ GF. From the XRD results of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites (Fig. S1), it is demonstrated that the substance transportation process is not restricted in LTO/HGF-1, so the impurity TiO2 disappeared. Due to the similar porous structure with LTO/HGF-1, there should be also no impurity in LTO/GF. Nevertheless, the existence of impurity TiO2 indicates the mixture of Li and Ti sources is still resisted in LTO/GF. It is easy to infer that the resistances originate from graphene sheets. Unlike LTO/HGF-1, there is no in-plane pores in the graphene sheets in LTO/GF, so ions could not pass through these graphene sheets. After shrinkage, the resistances from graphene sheets lead to uncomplete mixture of reagents and the formation of impurity TiO2."

Based on the peak current density shown in Fig. 6a, it could be concluded that LTO/ HGF-1 owns the best dynamic character among the three samples, which originates from the mesopore-oriented structure and in-plane nanopores of graphene sheets. In sharp contrast, LTO/GF owns the minimum current density which is even lower than blank LTO, demonstrating the weakest kinetics performance. Considering that LTO/GF has the similar porosity and particle size as to LTO/HGF-1, it is proved that the compact graphene sheets severely resist Liþ diffusion process after shrinkage. It is also indicated that in-plane pores of holey graphene sheets could reduce resistance of Liþ diffusion, which takes core role in enhancing power capability for dense Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite.\nMeanwhile, the CV results of other LTO/HGF composites (LTO/HGF2.5/1.75/0.2/0.1) are shown in Fig. S4. Besides the redox peaks of Li4Ti5O12 and TiO2, broad irreversible cathode peaks at 1 V–1.25 V are found in LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1. These irreversible reactions are caused by plentiful defects of excessive graphene and will dramatically decrease the initial efficiencies. From the first charge-discharge curves shown in Fig. S4, the coulombic efficiencies of LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 are separately 42% and 50%, which are dramatically lower than that of LTO/HGF-2.5, LTO/HGF-1.75 and LTO/HGF-1 (the initial efficiencies of the three samples exceed 97%). Moreover, among these Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites, the CV peaks of LTO/HGF-1\nSchema. 1. The effect of various particle sizes on the porous structure of composites in this article. (a) the dispersive particle size distribution, (b) moderate and uniform particle size distribution and (c) much small particle size distribution.\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\nare much sharper than others, indicating much better kinetics character. This means that the dynamic character of LTO/HGF-1 is not only superior to blank LTO and LTO/GF, but also the best in these Li4Ti5O12/ HGF composites.\nTo access the performances of Li4Ti5O12 particles in composites, the gravimetric-specific capacities at low current density (35 mA g 1) based on only Li4Ti5O12 are shown in Fig. 6b. The Li4Ti5O12 contents of all samples are calculated according to TG results in Fig. S5. It is found that blank LTO, LTO/HGF-2.5, LTO/HGF-1.75 all display a capacity around 170 mA h g 1, which is close to the theoretic capacity. Oppositely, LTO/ HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 have only 76 and 64 mA h g 1 respectively. Only based on the mass of Li4Ti5O12, LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF both deliver much higher capacities which exceed the theoretic value of 175 mA h g 1, which originate from the capacity contribution of graphene. At the cutoff voltage of LTO (1V vs Liþ/Li), graphene could display 50 mA h g 1. The calculated specific capacities of LTO/HGF an LTO/GF composite are all based on only Li4Ti5O12. Obviously, these\ncalculated specific capacities contain the contribution of graphene. Hence, the calculated values may exceed the theoretical value of 175 mA h g 1. LTO/GF and LTO/HGF-1 separately display high specific capacities of 190 mA h g 1 and 200 mA h g 1 as based only Li4Ti5O12 at 35 mA g 1 (shown in Fig. 6c). The calculated specific capacities both exceed the theoretical value of Li4Ti5O12. According to TG results, the graphene mass contents of LTO/GF and LTO/HGF-1 are 31% and 24%, respectively. Considering the specific capacity of graphene is 50 mA h g 1, it could be calculated that the specific capacities of Li4Ti5O12 in LTO/GF and LTO/HGF-1 are both nearly 175 mA h g 1, close to theoretical value. It is demonstrated that the nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles of LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF could display much better performances than other samples due to the unique porous structure. The rate performance results in Fig. S4 show that the capacities of LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/ HGF-0.1 decay fastest, nearly losing all capacities at 875 mA g 1. Additionally, the largest charge transfer resistances reflected from EIS results in Fig. S4 further show that LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 have\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\nthe worst dynamic characters even though both Li4Ti5O12 particles are the smallest. These results demonstrate that micropores and small mesopore structure is not suitable for Li4Ti5O12 to achieve good performance.\nFor other samples except LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 shown in Fig. 6c, the specific capacity of LTO/GF decays fastest and nearly lose all capacity at 7 A g 1. LTO/HGF-2.5 also has a rapid capacity decay and finally loses all capacity at 7 A g 1. Interestingly, LTO/HGF-1.75 and blank LTO have moderate capacity retention, which still have specific capacity of 57 mA h g 1 and 50 mA h g 1 at 7 A g 1, respectively. However, as the current density further increase, the capacities of LTO/ HGF-1.75 and blank LTO quickly decrease. Among these samples, LTO/ HGF-1 exhibits best rate performance, delivering a capacity of 150 mA h g 1 at 7 A g 1 with a retention of 78%. Even though based on the total mass of hybrid material, LTO/HGF-1 still owns the best rate performance as shown in Fig. S5 and always displays the highest capacity from 175 mA g 1 on. Unlike LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1, the rate performance differences among LTO/HGF-2.5, LTO/HGF-1.75 and LTO/ HGF-1 are mainly ascribed to the variety of Li4Ti5O12 particle size. This proves that moderate and concentrated mesopore distribution is enough for nanosized particles to achieve good rate performance. Moreover, concentrated mesopore distribution is benefic to get a high tap density, meaning that high tap density and good rate performance could be combined. Considering the similar particles sizes and porous structure, the obvious performance distinction between LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF demonstrates that the Liþ diffusion resistances from graphene sheets are much large after shrunk severely and in-plane nanopores of holey graphene take an important role in achieving good rate performances for compact composites.\nThe volumetric high-rate results of LTO/HGF-1, LTO/GF and blank LTO are shown in Fig. 6d. Due to the higher tap density, blank LTO and LTO/GF deliver higher volumetric-specific capacities than LTO/HGF-1 at low current density (below 175 mA g 1). Nevertheless, LTO/HGF-1 still exhibit a high volumetric-specific capacity of 160 mA h cm 3 at 35 mA g 1. However, LTO/HGF-1 displays the best capacity retention performance and the volumetric-specific capacity of LTO/HGF-1 becomes the highest from current density of 0.875 A g 1 on, which demonstrates the positive effect of mesopore-oriented holey-graphene framework for enhancing power capability in a compact composite. As current density increases to 14 A g 1 (80C), LTO/HGF-1 displays a volumetric-specific capacity of 104 mA h cm 3. In sharp contrast, LTO/ GF nearly loses all capacity and blank LTO only remains 30 mA h cm 3. Even the current density reaches 17.5 A g 1, LTO/HGF-1 could retain a volumetric-specific capacity of 98 mA h cm 3, exhibiting excellent volumetric power capability. As shown in Fig. 6f, the volumetric power capacity of LTO/HGF-1 is remarkedly better than other recent references, though the tap densities of Li4Ti5O12 in these references are a bit higher than this work (shown in Table S4). Table S4 demonstrates that the dense Li4Ti5O12 in recent references are all attributed to microporeoriented structure. The micropore-oriented structures result in high tap density, but hinder the high-rate capabilities. These results demonstrated that compact and mesopore-oriented holey-graphene framework anchored with nano-Li4Ti5O12 has great potential application in highrate Liþ batteries. Furthermore, LTO/HGF-1 also exhibits stable highrate cycle performance as shown in Fig. 6e. After 1000 cycles at 7 A g 1, LTO/HGF-1 still have 80% capacity retention. The long cycle stability should mainly originate from the zero-strain character of Li4Ti5O12. Moreover, the efficiency of every cycle is close to 100%, showing good reversibility of inter-deintercalation process.\nThe functions between the volumetric-specific capacity of LTO/HGF1 and mass loading are shown in Fig. S6. As the mass loadings of LTO/ HGF-1 increase, the capacities at low current density (<175 mA g 1) have no obvious distinction. As current density continues to increase, the volumetric-specific capacity of LTO/HGF-1 decay faster with higher mass loading. At a high mass loading of 3 mg cm 2, LTO/HGF-1 displays a volumetric capacity of 71 mA h cm 3 at 7 A g 1. Nevertheless, the\nvolumetric power capabilities of LTO/HGF-1 at high mass loading are still much better than other references, showing a great potential of practical application."

      "heading" : "3.3. Further electrochemical analyses of excellent volumetric power capability",
      "text" : "To deeply explore the reasons for excellent volumetric power capability of LTO/HGF-1, further electrochemical analyses are made. The EIS analysis results of blank LTO, LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF are shown in Fig. 7. Every Nyquist plot consists of a semicircle and a slanted line which are separately listed in the medium and low frequency region. The semicircle and slanted line sections are separately related to the charge transfer at the electrode surface and the Liþ diffusion process in the bulk electrode [47]. These features of electrochemical reaction process can be further analyzed through an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7a [48]. In the typical circuit, R1 is the DC resistance from electrolyte, electrode, interface et al. R2 represents the resistance of charge transfer process. Warburg impedance (W) is referred to the Liþ diffusion resistance, and constant phase element (CPE) is used to simulate double-layer capacitance.\nAccording to the equivalent circuit, the values of all elements are calculated and listed in Table 1. It is found that the value of R2 of LTO/ HGF-1 is the lowest, showing the fastest surface charge transfer speed. However, the R2 of LTO/GF is as much to 71.1 Ω and is over 4 times than that of LTO/HGF-1, which reveals that LTO/GF has a much high surface charge transfer resistance than LTO/HGF-1. It should be noted that LTO/ HGF-1 and LTO/GF have the similar porous structure and nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles except the in-plane nanopores of graphene sheets. Hence, it could be concluded that the remarkable distinction of R2 between LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF is caused by the in-plane pores of graphene sheets. Furthermore, the R2 of LTO/GF is even 3 times higher than that of blank LTO, demonstrating that without in-plane pores, the surface charge transfer process of LTO/GF is hinder much more intense than non-porous blank LTO. As known, low charge transfer resistance is beneficial to enhance power capability. Therefore, the low charge transfer resistance of LTO/HGF-1 is one of the reasons for its excellent ultrahigh-rate performance.\nThe apparent Liþ diffusion coefficient determines the power capability of composites and could be calculated due to Equations (1) and (2) [9]. In the following equations, molar gas constant (R) and Faraday constant (F) are 8.314 J mol 1 K 1 and 96485 C mol 1, respectively. The number of charge transfer (n) is 1 for Li4Ti5O12. In this experiment, the absolute temperature (T) is 303 K and the surface area of electrode (A) is 2.0 cm2. According to the tap density, the molar concentrations of Liþ (CLiþ) of blank LTO, LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF are calculated to be 4.18 � 10 3, 4.56 � 10 3, 5.32 � 10 3 mol cm 3 respectively. From the fitting results of Fig. 7b, the Warburg impedance coefficients (σ) of the three samples are calculated according to equation (2). Based on the all above paraments, the values of DLiþ are calculated and listed in Table 1.\nDLiþ ¼ ðRTÞ2\n2ðAn2F2CLiþσÞ2 (1)\nZ0 ¼R1 þ R2 þ σω 1=2  (2)\nIn Table 1, it is found that the DLiþ of LTO/HGF-1 is the highest and is over 2 order magnitudes higher than LTO/GF. Meanwhile, the DLiþ of LTO/GF is the lowest and is even 1 order magnitudes lower than blank LTO. It is further verified that the in-plane pores of hole-graphene sheets could greatly decrease the ion diffusion resistances in a dense composite. Without the in-plane pores, the ion diffusion resistance from graphene sheets increases acutely after shrinkage of graphene sheets. That leads to dramatical poor rate performance of LTO/GF, which is even much worse than blank LTO. In brief, with the mostly enhanced Liþ diffusion and charge transfer speed, LTO/HGF-1 exhibits excellent power capability.\nY. Xiang et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 447 (2020) 227372\nHowever, it is important to note that only if holey graphene sheets couple with suitable porous structure, the composite could display excellent volumetric power capability. The simulation results of EIS measurements for the series of LTO/HGF composites are shown in Table S2. It is shown that except LTO/HGF-1, other LTO/HGF composites have much high charge transfer resistance (R2). Moreover, the charge transfer resistances of LTO/HGF-0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 are separately much to 450 and 760 Ω due to the micropore and smallmesopore structure. On the other hand, because of disperse larger mesopore structure in LTO/HGF-2.5 and LTO/HGF-1.75, the charge transfer resistances are both higher than LTO/HGF-1. In addition, the Liþ diffusion coefficients of LTO/HGF-2.5, LTO/HGF-1.75, LTO/HGF0.2 and LTO/HGF-0.1 are much lower than LTO/HGF-1. It is proved that without appropriate porous structure, only holey graphene sheets could not achieve good power capability.\nTo supplementary understand the excellent power capability, kinetics analysis was further applied by CV tests at various rate and the results are shown in Fig. 8. Based on the CV curves in Fig. 8a–c, it could distinguish the diffusion and the capacitive contribution for blank LTO, LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF. The response current at a fixed potential could be divided into diffusion-controlled (k2ν1/2) and pseudocapacitive parts (k1ν) which are able to be quantified according to equation (3) [49]. Fig. 8d shows the fitting results for anodic peaks of blank LTO, LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF. The values of k1 of LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF are separately 0.45 and 0.36, showing amounts of pseudocapacitive effect exist in the deintercalation process. However, the k1 of blank LTO is about 0, proving no any pseudocapacitive storage capacity and the kinetic character is absolutely controlled by the diffusion process. The plotting results for cathodic peaks (shown in Fig. S7) also reveal that there is no pseudocapacitive effect in blank LTO (k1 ¼ 0) and amounts of pseudocapacitive effect exists in LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF (k1 ¼ 0.26, 0.12 for LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF, respectively). Moreover, Fig. 8e exhibits the pseudocapacitive contribution (black region) reaches 30% of the total capacity in LTO/HGF-1 at 10 mV s 1.\niðVÞ¼ k1νþ k2ν1=2 (3)\nThere are outstanding differences in diffusion capacity contributions\nfor the three samples. Though there is no pseudocapacitive effect in blank LTO, yet the larger k2 (shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S7) means the diffusion capacity contribution of blank LTO is higher than that of LTO/ GF. It is verified again that Liþ diffusion process in LTO/GF is severely hindered by graphene sheets even with enough mesopore. For the deintercalation process of LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF, the ratios of capacitive and diffusion capacities at various scan rates are calculated and the results are shown in Fig. 8f. Firstly, the deintercalation capacity of LTO/HGF-1 is always higher than LTO/GF at every rate, revealing better power capability. Secondly, the diffusion capacity is always the dominating contribution in LTO/HGF-1 at each rate. However, the diffusion capacity of LTO/GF decays much faster than capacitive capacity and its capacitive effect becomes the dominating contribution as rate exceeds 5 mV s 1. Besides, at a fixed rate, the pseudocapacitive capacity contribution of LTO/HGF-1 is much lower than LTO/GF. The same change trend is observed in the intercalation process of LTO/HGF1 and LTO/GF (shown in Fig. S4). All above results have proven that LTO/HGF-1 has a much lower Liþ diffusion resistances than LTO/GF, which is the core reason for the excellent power capability of LTO/HGF1. Considering LTO/HGF-1 and LTO/GF have the similar mesoporeoriented structure and nanosized Li4Ti5O12 particles, it is further verified that the in-plane nanopores of holey graphene sheets greatly decrease the Liþ diffusion resistances in the compact composite and improve the diffusion capacity at high rate, showing the fatal role of holey-graphene in achieving excellent power capability."

Unlike previous dense Li4Ti5O12 with micropore-oriented porosity, this article successfully achieved a trade-off between moderate mesopore-oriented porosity for rapid Liþ diffusion and a high tap density through precisely controlling the porous structures of Li4Ti5O12/HGF composites. Even with suitable mesopore-oriented porosity, shrunk graphene sheets greatly resist Liþ diffusion in a dense composite, hindering the improvement of power capability. The in-plane nanopores of holeygraphene sheets permit Liþ to pass and remarkedly weaken the Liþ diffusion resistances, taking a fatal role in achieving the excellent ultrahigh-rate capability for dense Li4Ti5O12/HGF composite. As the initial amounts ratio of HGO to Li4Ti5O12 is 1:1, the as-prepared LTO/ HGF-1 composite has a high tap density of 1.1 g cm 3, ultrahigh rate volumetric capacity of 98 mA h cm 3 at 17.5 A g 1 and long cycle stability.
