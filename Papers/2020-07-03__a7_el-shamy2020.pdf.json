      "text" : "Undoubtedly, water is the main source of our life, and it is considered the main and only source that creates and keeps all the surviving beings in the universe. Recently, the quality of the water captured the attention of scientists, and the study of improving the quality of water is much concerned for them. In order to address this point, water research laboratories and institutes have been established. However, the problem is still remaining, and the quality of water decreases thanks to the unwanted reactions (physical, chemical and biochemical) that take place by the time in the distribution systems and the harmful bacteria, as well [1,2]. Drinking water faces a lot of physical and chemical parameters affecting its quality such as concentrations of chlorides and nitrates in water, water hardness, pH and turbidity [3]. In the last few years, water body surface has been polluted, owing to the ejections of wastewater that have many pollutants like organics, wastes of agriculture and the household sludge [4]. The existence of very small quantities of organic pollutants, like water‒coloring agents/dyes, in water surroundings have been proposed to realize clashing effects on human and ecological systems [5]. In fact, dyes are applied in many industrial applications, for example, leather tanning, fabric industry,\nfood flavors, medical inspection, and also inserting in the industries of cosmetics. It is known that even low concentrations of dyes (< 1mg/L) in water are noticeable, unfavorable, not familiar and harmful [6]. Methyl orange (MO) is one of the most known dyes with the chemical formula (C14H14N3NaO3S), which is extensively used in the fabric industry. Also, methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B are very harmful dyes due to their negative effects on human health. Long time contact with methyl orange, methylene blue and Rhodamine B dyes will produce rising in the heart beats, cyanosis, tumours, liver diseases and human skin irritation [7]. In order to remove methyl orange, methylene blue and Rhodamine B from liquid solutions, many approaches were applied such as membrane separation, coagulation/flocculation, photocatalysis, biological treatment, electrochemical and adsorption technique [5–8]. Particularly, photocatalysis approaches that used some metal oxide compounds like zinc oxide (ZnO) [9], titanium oxide (TiO2) [10] and others; have been demonstrated to be an effective procedure with enhanced efficiency and capability to remove dyes on a large scale besides having other benefits such as recovery, and recycling of adsorbents [11].\nStarting from this point, the configuring and discovery of new photocatalytic materials are considered one of the most important fields\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.synthmet.2020.116472 Received 12 April 2020; Received in revised form 17 May 2020; Accepted 5 June 2020\nE-mail address: agabedelazim@yahoo.com.\nSynthetic Metals 267 (2020) 116472\n0379-6779/ © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nT\ntoday due to their applications in the removal of organic pollutants and solar energy conversion [12]. The innovation of a new photocatalyst with a superior catalytic performance and high stability is a great challenge and attracted the attention of researchers and academics. Recently, large amount of literatures based on metal oxide photocatalysts have been reported, for instance ZnO, TiO2, and SrTiO3 [13–17]. Among all the metal oxide structures, ZnO and TiO2 are considered the most using materials for photocatalysis applications and environmental sustainability [18,19], due to their ease of preparation in nano-scale or bulk scale, high photocatalytic activity, economical and their abundance. But the large energy gap (3.2 eV) of ZnO prevents its use as a photocatalyst in UV light. This is considered as a great limitation where 5 % of solar energy is unusable or wasted [20,21]. As well, many problems for these metal oxide materials were reported such as poor stability, using a small amount of solar energy and the low rate of electron-hole pairs recombination are still limiting their applications [19–25]. In fact, TiO2 nanoparticles share ZnO nanoparticles in the same problems such as the large band gap and the wasted solar energy. However, it is still a great challenge to obtain the photocatalyst with high catalytic activity that can be recycled. Therefore, the need for innovation and building novel photocatalysts to increase both the operational stability and photochemical activity is crucial and essential. To realize these aims, an ideal photocatalyst material should at least realize the following features: high stability, highly activation by low photon energy and efficient separation capacity of electron–hole pairs. To achieve these goals, carbon materials especially carbon quantum dots (CDots) are extensively applied in the photocatalysis uses due to their high electrical conductivity, harmlessness and up-conversion PL behavior. In addition, CDots warp the surface of metal oxide materials to protect them from the corrosion during the process of photocatalytic and increase the structural stability [26]. In fact the composite of CDots with metal oxides is not only increasing the photo-stability but also increasing the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the unique photochemical and physical properties of CDots facilitate its usage as photosensitizers [27]. Particularly, CDots are used as photocatalysts for harvesting (N)IR light due to their PL properties that depend on the excitation wavelength and photo-induced electron-transfer [28].\nBearing in mind such significant properties, we offered an engineered and novel metal peroxide-CDots system, which will be a trail to enhance the photo-stability, high responsiveness to UV-spectrum area and balance charge separation. Lately, there are numerous reports on using the composite (CDots/Zinc oxide ZnO) and CDots/TiO2 in photocatalytic applications, for instance, Li et al. [29] reported on CDots/ZnO system for the removal of Rh.B dyes. They found that pure ZnO has photodegradation efficiency about 30 % and CDots/ZnO has photodegradation efficiency about 81 % within 2 h of UV irradiation. Bozetine et al. [30] reported on nano-composites CDots/ZnO for photocatalytic properties under visible light. They found that CDots/ZnO (at 80 °C) will be able to remove Rh.B dyes with an efficiency that may reach 83 % within 105min. Also, the efficiency of this system increases to be 94 % after 105min of irradiation when annealing the system at 200 °C. The authors also reported that the efficiency reduces to be 88 % for CDots/ZnO (200 °C) after four runs of the experiment stability. Ding et al. also studied the effect of ZnO foam/CDots on the photo-degradation of three different dyes Rh.B, MO and MB under visible light irradiation [31]. They studied the effect of 100mg of ZnO foam decorated with (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 g of CDots) on the photo-degradation of MO, MB and Rh.B dyes. They found that (100mg of ZnO foam with 0.2 g of CDots) is able to remove Rh.B dyes completely within 4 h under visible light. Also, they found that at the same concentration of the photocatalyst, the system was able to remove 50 % of MO and 95 % of MB within 3 h of visible light irradiation. Also, Muthulingam et al. prepared (CDots/N-ZnO) photocatalyst for degradation of dyes such as MB, fluorescein dyes and malachite green dye under daylight [32]. They also stated that CDots/N-ZnO system can be able to remove MB completely with efficiency (100 %) and N-ZnO has the ability to remove 82\n% of MB in 60min of daylight irradiation. Also, they found that both NZnO and CDots/N-ZnO systems are stable for four recycles, where in the 4th cycle; CDots/N-ZnO required 90min to remove the dyes completely and N-ZnO needed 4 h to remove 95 % of MB.\nAs seen, although these photocatalysts seems to be good catalysts due to their higher efficiency, but these catalysts are restricted by special conditions (such as they only work in alkaline media) and this in turn hinders their large scale industrial applications and they also have many shortcomings such as low specific surface area, fast electron-hole pairs recombination, low response to light and the requirement of a long time to reach the desired efficiency. Also, the stability and recovery of these materials is still problematic [1,33] and they must be functionalized by (N, S, and other) groups to break these restrictions. Thus to overcome these shortcomings we introduce cheap, rapid/fast, environment friendliness photocatalyst based on carbon dots decorated zinc peroxide (CDots/ZnO2) can be used for removing three different dyes with higher efficiency, high recovery, high photo-stability, high recycling and also the capability of operating under ambient conditions and also action in a natural pH medium. Also, it can be able to remove a huge volume of the dye molecules in many industries. Moreover, this (CDots/ZnO2) system has a high operational stability without any loss in its efficiency.\nIn this study, we are fascinated with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) particles in nano-scale, as their structure has two oxygen atoms linked by a single bond. Besides, ZnO2 particles have much attention from scientists and academics due to their unique properties and promising functional potential applications, which arise from the increase in the electronegativity (excess of oxygen) behavior and their higher oxidization potential behavior of these nano-particles. From this fact, the MgO2 nano-rods were used to eliminate the MO dye under the UV irradiation [33]. Also, the ZnO2 particles have been used in Rhodamine B (RB) removal under UV irradiation [34]. Also, ZnO2 particles have been used in detoxification of mustard gas [35]. Additionally, the ZnO2 powder is applied in many industrial fields, such as oral surgeries, wear resistance, cosmetic, and others [35]. However, the study of photocatalytic behavior of the metal peroxides and their composites with CDots are available until now. And the photocatalytic behavior of the metal peroxides and their composites materials still need more research.\nIn this work, we report a new photocatalyst based on ZnO2 and CDots/ZnO2 in which ultra-thin layers of insoluble CDots wrapping ZnO2 nano-structures are used as the synergetic catalysts. The photocatalyst CDots/ZnO2 shows an excellent charge separation and superior photocatalytic performance in removing methylene (MB) blue (99 ± 1 % in 50min), methyl (MO) orange (91 ± 2 % in 60min), and Rhodamine B dyes (99 ± 1 % in 80min) under the UV-A light. Also, the main roles of CDots layers and ZnO2 nano-particles in photocatalysts were studied, respectively. CDots/ZnO2 has a photocatalytic activity higher than ZnO2, TiO2 and CDots/TiO2 due to the synergetic effects of the following: (1) ZnO2 and CDots nano-particles contributed in electron-hole pairs separation; (2) CDots have mutual-benefits as electron reservoir behavior and the brilliant up-converted PL; (3) a favorable electron pathway provided by CDots/ZnO2 architectures, CDots→ZnO2, for the electronhole pairs separation. The engineering of CDots/ZnO2 nano-structure displayed a high catalytic performance and a large capacity of migrated electrons at UV-A light than CDots/TiO2 due to their high electronegativity (excess of oxygen/charges) behavior of ZnO2, which facilitates to produce more and more photoelectrons, by the way increasing the photo-current response. Also, the CDots/ZnO2 is still working for along five cycles, according to the recycling experiment. However, the photocatalyst CDots/TiO2 prepared in our experiment showed some higher photocatalytic efficiency higher than that reported in many previous literatures, this is may be due to the differences in the experimental conditions and environments during the photocatalytic process. Finally, this work introduces an invaluable methodology aiming at eliminating the environmental pollution by designing new\nphotocatalysts with brilliant photocatalytic activity and high operational stability."

      "heading" : "3.1. Characterization (TEM, SEM,XRD, XPS) of the samples",
      "text" : "XRD peaks of all samples are depicted in Fig. 1. It can be seen that a single hump was shown at 2θ=23° for C(002) plane of CDots, due to the hexagonal lattice structure of graphite CDots [1,14–17,23–27,33] (Fig. 1a). Fig. (1b) shows the XRD patterns of ZnO2 nano-particles. The (hkl) planes are specified on top of each pattern. All the diffraction patterns of the obtained ZnO2 nano-particles have been attributed to a cubic system of ZnO2, which is compatible with (JCPDS Card No. 75- 1585, ZnO2) [34,35]. Four diffraction peaks were indexed to (111), (200), (220), and (311), which characterize the crystalline phase of ZnO2. There were no obvious diffraction peaks noticed in XRD pattern other than that matching to ZnO2, up to the X-ray detection limit. However, XRD patterns of CDots/ZnO2 nano-composite (Fig. 1c) indicate that no change has been observed in the crystalline phase of ZnO2 by coating CDots on the surface of ZnO2. In addition, the signal of CDots was observed in the CDots/ZnO2 nano-composite that indicates the coating of CDots on the surface of ZnO2. Also, the XRD patterns of CDots/TiO2 nanocomposite were scanned (Fig S1). It was observed that, besides the peaks of CDots nanoparticles at 2θ=23°, there are four additional peaks at 2θ=25.31°, 37.87°, 48.06°, 54.01° and 55.01° for (hkl) planes (101), (004), (200), (105) and (211), which are attributed to the anatase phase of TiO2 nanoparticles (JCPDS 21–1272) and the peaks at 27.50°, 36.01° and 41.19° for (hkl) planes (110), (101) and (111), which are attributed to the rutile phase of TiO2 nanoparticles (JCPDS 21–1276) [36].\nFig (2) shows the TEM images for all the prepared samples. As seen,\nCDots appears with a spherical shape and regular edges (Fig. 2a). Also, on the statistical scale, the distribution of the size ranging from 2 to 18 nm with the average size was around 9.5 ± 2 nm. Also, ZnO2 was observed in the nano-scale with spherical form (Fig. 2b) with average size 15.9 ± 5 nm. But after decorating CDots on ZnO2 surface, no change in the particle size was observed (Fig. 2c). However, it clear that ZnO2 surface decorated with CDots layers. HRTEM image shows the crystalline structure of plane (110) of sp2 graphitic CDots with 0.22 nm lattice space [1,14–17,23–27,33], and (111) plane of ZnO2 nano-particles with 0.28 nm lattice space [34].\nThe surface morphology of the prepared samples is explored by the FE-SEM microscope, (Fig. 3). The micrograph shows the formation of ZnO2 with a spherical structure and a particle size smaller than 50 nm (Fig. 3a). Also, the image of CDots/ZnO2 nano-composite shows no obviously change or difference in morphology or particle size between CDots/ZnO2 and ZnO2 (Fig. 3b). It is also obvious that, CDots/ZnO2 nanoparticles have a spherical structure and also it has a regular shape as compared to ZnO2 nano-particles. As clearly shown, both the micrographs of ZnO2 and CDots/ZnO2 nano-particles are distributed in well manner with particles size in a nanoscale with average size smaller than 50 nm.\nThe energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to assure the formation of the synthesized ZnO2 nano-particles and CDots/ZnO2 nano-composite and identify to their compositions, and also to confirm the obtained results from (FE-SEM) as depicted in Fig. 3(c,d). EDS spectrum confirms the presence of Zinc (Zn) element at E=1.2 KeV and oxygen (O2) at E=0.5 KeV. As seen, the ratio of Oxygen to zinc is\n2:1 that is evident of formation of ZnO2. But in the EDS spectrum of CDots/ZnO2 nano-composite, a carbon signal was observed at E=0.2 KeV, besides the signals of Zinc and Oxygen, proving the decoration of CDots on ZnO2 surface. On the other hand the EDS spectrum of CDots/ TiO2 was performed (Fig S1) to identify the sample elements. It was observed that, in addition to the signals of the carbon and oxygen, the signal of the Ti element was also detected. More evidence, the XPS spectra of the CDots/TiO2 nanocomposite were scanned (Fig S2 and S3)."

      "heading" : "3.2. Interaction with light",
      "text" : "The optical absorption spectra of the samples were measured in the region of 200−800 nm (Fig. 4a). As seen, the ZnO2 nanoparticles show a higher UV and Visible absorption than the TiO2. Also, the indirect band gap of both ZnO2 and TiO2 was obtained from the relation between (αhv)1/2 vs. hv [1,14–17,23–27,33]. The indirect band gaps for ZnO2 and TiO2 were found to be 3.21 and 3.40 eV, respectively. The reason behind the broadening absorption band and the decreasing of band gap of ZnO2 may be due to the oxygen vacancy or due to the strong electronic transitions between the O–Zn–O and OeO bonds [33], which create this broad absorption band and producing a dangling orbitals, increasing the band tails in the nano-composite and hence decreasing the band gaps [37]. Interestingly, CDots/ZnO2 nano-composite possesses absorption intensity higher than CDots/TiO2 nano-composite in the same range of measurements, particularly for λ < 350 nm. Remarkably, the synergetic effect of CDots, ZnO2 and TiO2 was clearly observed by improving the intensity of the absorption\nthrough the whole UV–vis spectrum. At first, the decoration of CDots on the surface of ZnO2 or TiO2 increases the intensity of the absorption. Second, the broadening of the typical absorption peak was observed by the decoration of CDots. Third, red shift behavior was observed from 350 nm to nearly 460 nm as a compared with TiO2 and ZnO2. The indirect band gaps were evaluated for CDots/ZnO2 and CDots/TiO2 and were found to be 1.75 and 2.25 eV, respectively. This behavior was shown a promising result for enhancing the optical response of the photocatalysts.\nOn the other hand, the absorption spectrum of CDots nano-particles as a function of wavelength is depicted in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that CDots spectrum has two absorption bands in UV region at 216 and 293 nm. The bands at 216 and 293 nm are parallel to those of CDots synthesized by a hydrothermal reduction process of the graphene oxide (GO) [38]. The band at 216 nm is produced from the electronic band transition π-π* type of the C]C bonds, while the band at 293 nm is ascribed to the electronic band transition n-π* type of the C]O bond [1,39].\nFig (4c) shows the up conversion PL spectra of CDots at different excitation wavelength (λexcitation). As seen, the up-conversion behavior of CDots was clearly observed, where the (N)IR light was absorbed by CDots and then emit PL spectra at a shorter wavelength. That is to say, CDots/ZnO2 nano-composites can be excited with a wide range spectrum of incident light by up-conversion process.\nMany experiments were performed to study the behavior of charge carrier migration and prevent the charge pairs recombination. The\nNyquist diagram of EIS shows that the charge transfer resistance is decreased by the application of CDots and ZnO2 (Fig. 5a). A Nyquist diagram shows a semicircle (arc) behavior, which is characterized by the process of charge transfer while the semicircle diameter indicated the internal resistance of the materials. As seen, from the Nyquist diagram the radius of the semicircle (arc) for CDots/TiO2, CDots/ZnO2 and ZnO2 is smaller than that of TiO2, which refers that these materials have a resistance smaller than that of TiO2. By the way, the obtained data shows that CDots act as a source of electron transfer between CDots and ZnO2 and also between CDots and TiO2, thus the charge migration is produced and the interfacial charge separation is generated, thus reducing the dissipation of energy. This obtained behavior proves that CDots/ZnO2 has the behavior of charge-carrier migration and prevents the charge-pairs recombination. It is worth to mention, ZnO2 has arc radius smaller than TiO2, this is may be attributed to the excess of charges that can be produce an electron transfer behavior and the enhancement of photocatalytic performance.\nThe time-resolved PL behavior was measured to study the significance of the process of dynamic electron migration (Fig. 5b). Obviously, the nano-second scale fast decay behavior was observed for TiO2, ZnO2, CDots/TiO2 and CDots/ZnO2 samples. The results refer to the rate of the charge recombination of TiO2 tends to gain a specific constraint [40,41]. By using exponential fitting model, TiO2, ZnO2, CDots/ TiO2 and CDots/ZnO2 have lifetime 0.50, 0.77, 1.21 and 1.91 ns, respectively. As seen, TiO2 has an intrinsic fluorescence lifetime of 0.50 ns. This is attributed to the electron-hole pairs recombination\nbehavior under the excitation of light. Also, it can be seen that lifetime of (CDots/ZnO2) increases when CDots warped ZnO2 surface. The increase in the lifetime of charge carriers indicates the acceleration of charge transfer reaction enhanced by the insertion of ZnO2 and CDots. The longest decay time was obtained by CDots/ZnO2 system; this indicates that this system has a rapid electron transfer mechanism through (CDots→ZnO2). The fast and rapid charge transfer mechanism is the main reason behind the enhancement of the photo-current and photocatalytic performance. Also, these data reveal that ZnO2 nano-particles have the ability to store the electrons produced by photon in the photocatalysis reaction."

      "text" : "In fact, before starting the photocatalysis experiment we calculated the electronegativity of the ZnO2 nanoparticles (supplementary materials). The results show that the photo-generated holes in ZnO2 possess oxidizing ability stronger than that in TiO2, which gives ZnO2 to be a high photocatalyst higher than TiO2.\nIt is known that, the study of the catalyst concentration of (CDots/ ZnO2) is very important. (Fig. 6a) shows the impact of the adsorbent concentration of CDots/ZnO2 on the photo-activity for degradation efficiency. As seen, the photocatalysis activity was increased with the growth of the concentration of CDots/ZnO2 nano-particles. The degradation activity was displayed the best value, when the concentration of CDots/ZnO2 reaches 50mg/L. However, the rate of MO degradation reduced when the concentration of CDots/ZnO2 nano-particles increased over these values. This behavior was observed due to the increase in the concentration of CDots/ZnO2 can obstruct the generation of active radicals by inhibiting the reaction between the (e−/h+) pairs and the adsorbed oxidants (O2)/reducers (OH−). Alternatively, this behavior is attributed to the interaction between the harvesting of light photons and the active species of photo-degradation dyes.\nAlso, the effect of pH value on the photodegradation efficiency (%) was studied (Fig. 6b). From Fig. 6b, it can be seen that the ZnO2 is unable to work in the acidic medium, this is due to the dissolution of ZnO2 in acidic medium especially around (pH=4) [42]. However, the efficiency (%) was increased in the acidic medium and reaches to 70 % at pH=3 just when the ZnO2 nanoparticles decorated with CDots. However the CDots/ZnO2 photocatalyst shows a good efficiency in the neutral pH value and in basic medium. This is may be due to the decoration of ZnO2 with CDots layers, which protect the ZnO2 from the\ndissolution and corrosive behavior. These results give this photocatalyst some advantages in its photocayalytic application because of it is not need to special conditions and work in neutral media.\nExperimentally, 50mg/L of CDots/ZnO2 and pH=7 is the best concentration and pH value selected here to the photocatalytic performance for MO, MB and Rh.B degradation under UV-A irradiation based on the conditions of the above experiments. For the photocatalysis experiment, 50mg/L of photocatalyst (CDots/ZnO2) was inserted into 100mL of (10mg/L) dye solution with adjusting pH at 7 and the mixture was stirred for 60min. Then the above mixture was irradiated under UV-A light to study the photo-degradation of MO, MB and Rh.B dyes. It is worthy mention that, the photolysis of MO, MB and Rh.B is very slow and negligible from the blank experiment data.\nFrom (Fig. 7a), the efficiency of MB photodegradation over CDots/ ZnO2 catalyst is 99 ± 1 % within 50min under the illumination of UVA light. On the other hand, the efficiency of MB photodegradation is 91 ± 3 % for catalyst ZnO2 within 50min. It is clear that, CDots/ZnO2 shows photocatalytic activity higher than ZnO2, where CDots/ZnO2 shows a 10 % improvement than ZnO2. On the other hand, the degradation of MB was studied by the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and CDots/TiO2 under the same conditions (Fig. 7b). It was found that CDots/ TiO2 has photocatalytic efficiency 75 ± 3 % and TiO2 shows 30 ± 1 % within 50min under the UV-A illumination. More interestingly, ZnO2 shows photocatalytic efficiency higher than TiO2 (ca. 60 % within 50min of UV-A irradiation).\nThe degradation of MO was studied by the photocatalytic activity of ZnO2 and CDots/ZnO2 under UV irradiation, see Fig. 8a. Where, the efficiency of MO photo-degradation over CDots/ZnO2 catalyst is 91 ± 2 % within 60min under the illumination of UV-A light. But ZnO2 shows photo-degradation efficiency 70 ± 4 % at 60min. On the other hand, CDots/TiO2 and TiO2 have efficiency 60 ± 1 % and 45 ± 2 % at 60min (Fig. 8b).\nThe degradation of Rh.B was studied by the photocatalytic activity of ZnO2 and CDots/ZnO2 under UV-A, see Fig. 9a. The efficiency of Rh.B photo-degradation over CDots/ZnO2 catalyst is 99 ± 1 % and for ZnO2 ∼ 85 ± 4 % within 80min under the illumination of UV-A light. Alternatively, the Rh.B degradation was studied by the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and CDots/TiO2 under the same conditions (Fig. 9b). As seen, CDots/TiO2 system has photocatalytic efficiency 80 ± 2 % and for TiO2∼ 45 ± 3 % within 80min under the UV-A illumination. Also, the ZnO2 still shows photocatalytic efficiency higher than TiO2.\nFrom the results, ZnO2 nano-particles show some higher\nphotocatalytic efficiency and degrade the MO, MB and Rh.B dyes faster than the TiO2 nanoparticles. Also, their CDots/ZnO2 composites show higher photocatalytic efficiency and degrade the MO, MB and Rh.B dyes faster than their CDots/TiO2 composites. This is can be illustrated on the basis of the transient photocurrent response. The separation conditions and charge transfer of the samples as photoelectrods were studied by scanning the response of photocurrent as a function of time. Fig. 10 shows the transient photocurrent through four runs of on-off illumination of light. As seen, the obtained data showed that these photocatalysts have good photostability. It is clear that, CDots/ZnO2 has a higher photocurrent density than the other samples (TiO2, ZnO2 and CDots/TiO2) due to the photo-generated current originating from the migration of electrons that generated by photon to the back contact, as a results improving the value of the photocurrent. This means that the higher photoelectrons generation and transport will produced due to CDots works as a source of electrons and the ZnO2 also has an excess of electronegative (charges) behavior, which helps to produce more and more photoelectrons. Also, the obtained results demonstrate that the synergetic effect of ZnO2 and CDots has the ability to separate the electron-hole pairs that generated by photon more than the other\nsamples (TiO2, ZnO2 and CDots/TiO2) and inhibit the recombination of electron-hole. Also, the BET analysis was studied to support and discuss the above results. Fig. 11 shows the distributions of pore size and the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of TiO2, ZnO2 and CDots/TiO2 and CDots/ZnO2 catalysts. Also, Table 1 shows the textural parameters of these catalysts. It is worth noticed that all catalysts have the same type of isotherms (IV isotherms type), proving the presence of mesoporous structure [26]. Also, it very important to mentioned that the BET surface area of the TiO2 and ZnO2 after decorating with CDots (CDots/TiO2 and CDots/ZnO2) is slightly decreased when they compared with TiO2 and ZnO2, which was produced by the close packed structure between ZnO2/TiO2 and CDots. Also, it worth to clarify the photocatalysts that have an advantageous mesoporous structure to photocatalytic reaction because the mesoporous structure can offer an effective method for the products and reactant movements and enable the reactants adsorption on the photocatalyst surfaces [26]. Since the small variance in the surface area among the decorated ZnO2/TiO2 with CDots catalysts and ZnO2/TiO2, the enhancement in photocatalytic performance has slight relation to the surface area."

      "text" : "The performance of the reuse catalytic reaction of CDots/ZnO2 was studied under the same conditions (Fig. 12). The experiment was performed for five runs with each run lasting for 50min. It can be seen, after the 5th run of CDots/ZnO2 treatment, the photocatalysis activity is still showing the same value which means the high stability of CDots/ ZnO2 catalyst along the five runs.\nAccording to the above experimental data, there are two potential mechanisms that can be suggested to explain the enhancement of the photocatalyst (CDots/ZnO2) stability. (i) The coating/decorating of CDots nano-particles on the surface of ZnO2 nano-particles inhibits the dissolution of ZnO2 during the reaction in vessel reactor. So, the stability of (CDots/ZnO2) catalyst can be improved through the process of the photocatalysis. (ii) CDots nano-particles act as electron donor/receptor, which can draw the electrons from ZnO2 nano-particles. This leads to a delay in the possible photo-corrosion reaction and enhances the photostability of CDots/ZnO2."

      "text" : "The higher efficiency of CDots/ZnO2 catalyst can be attributed to the effects of CDots and ZnO2 nano-particles features, as illustrated in (Scheme 2).\nThe main explanations are: (i) the photo-generated electron–hole pairs are separated by both CDots and ZnO2. This separation is done by obstructing/blocking the recombination of charge to produce photoreactive sites. These reactive sites serve as a reservoir of electrons [43–45]. Once the pairs of (e–/h+) are generated when applying light energy greater or equal to the catalyst band gap, the energy levels facilitate the transfer of the electrons from the conduction band of ZnO2 to the close located levels of CDots, which aid to separate the pairs (e–/ h+) that were produced by light via inhibiting the recombination of charge to produce photo-reactive sites [44]. (ii) In fact, the difference in energies between the work function of CDots and the conduction band of ZnO2 make the applicability of the electronic coupling between CDots through (π electrons) and ZnO2 conduction band strong, producing the up-conversion and expanded the capability of absorbing light to longer wavelength region [46]. Also, it is possible to create a massive amount of photo-reactive sites when holes are near ZnO2 valence bands, this leads to creating free radicals with high energy. For instance, the superoxide radicals (⋅ −O2 ) created by the interaction of CDots and ZnO2 have rich and excess of electrons with the adsorbed oxygen molecules. At the same time, the hydroxide (⋅OH ) is created by migration of the holes to the surface and reacts with H2O molecules. Also, the perhydroxide (⋅OOH ) is produced by the superoxide protonation. Generally, these free-radicals with their own high energy are accountable for degradation of bigger dye molecules into tiny fragments [47,48]. The higher photocatalytic performance of CDots/ZnO2 catalyst can be attributed to the effects of CDots [49] and ZnO2 nano-particles features. The reactions can be stated as follow:\n+ → +\n+ →\n+ →\n+ → +\n→\n+ → +\n+ → +\n+ → +\n− +\n− −\n+ −\n− C /ZnO hv e (C ) h (ZnO ) e O O h OH OH O H O H O OH"

From the table, it can be noticed that, (i) in the current study, the concentration of our catalyst is large relative to the concentration of the dyes. However, in comparison with the reported catalysts (Table 2) it was found that the concentration is suitable and acceptable with the other reported catalysts. From the fact of an ideal photocatalyst, where it must be able to remove a high concentration of dyes or a high volume of the dye molecules, it was found that our catalyst was able to remove a huge volume (100mL) of the dye molecules relative to the other reported catalysts. (ii) Data obtained from this photocatalyst have some better quality than that reported in the previous works. This is may be due to the up-conversion luminescence behavior and the induced electron transfer by light photon features of CDots, the synergetic affect, the design of charge-transfer channels and up-converting light into chemical energy for the high-efficiency of photocatalysis. However, this photocatalyst has some drawbacks such as its limited in the near infrared light. So, we suggest that the decoration of this catalyst with a metal with surface plasmon resonance to produce a schottky junction will improve its performance, make it work on a wide/full spectrum, increase its stability and improving photocurrent response."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In conclusion, photocatalyst (CDots/ZnO2) with high performance is engineered by combining the tunable luminescence CDots and ZnO2. CDots/ZnO2 has a photocatalytic activity against MB, MO and Rh.B higher than ZnO2, TiO2 and CDots/TiO2 due to the synergetic effects of the following: (1) ZnO2 and CDots nano-particles contributed to electron-hole pairs separation; (2) CDots have mutual-benefits as electron reservoir behavior and the brilliant up-converted PL; (3) a favorable electron pathway provided by CDots/ZnO2 architectures, CDots→ZnO2, for the electron-hole pairs separation. The engineering of CDots/ZnO2 nano-structure displayed a high catalytic performance and a large\ncapacity of migrating electrons at UV-A light than CDots/TiO2 due to the excess of oxygen/charges behavior of ZnO2, which facilitates producing more and more photoelectrons, in the same way of increasing the photo-current response. This work does not only give some vision concerning the building of photocatalysts based on metal peroxide/ CDots, but also opens the horizons to a wide range of the engineering of photocatalysts with high sensitivity to low light energy. Finally, the obtained results offer a new photocatalyst based on metal peroxide/ CDots for potential applications in the current environmental pollution, energy and other related fields.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nAhmed gamal El-Shamy: Conceptualization, Methodology,\nSoftware, Visualization, Investigation, Software, Validation, Data curation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThere is no declaration of interest."

The structural and chemical compositions of (CDots/ZnO2) catalyst have been described using XRD, BET, SEM, and TEM. The decoration of CDots on ZnO2 surface is confirmed by XRD and TEM microscope. Then the photocatalysis activity of CDots/ZnO2 has studied for methyl orange, methylene blue and Rhodamine B dyes and compared with CDots/TiO2. CDots/ZnO2 shows higher photocatalytic activity than CDots/TiO2, due to its excellent charge separation, large total pore volume and/or size and higher photoresponsive behavior of CDots/ZnO2. Photocatalyst (CDots/ZnO2) nano-composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity and high stability in UV-A spectrum range thanks to the up-conversion luminescence and photoinduced electron transfer behavior of CDots. Moreover, the superior photocatalytic activity of CDots/ZnO2 is attributed to the synergetic effect and the design of charge-transfer channel. Also, the stability of CDots/ZnO2 stands for along five cycles without any change. This effort introduces an invaluable methodology aiming at eliminating the environmental pollution by designing new photocatalysts with brilliant photocatalytic activity and high operational stability.",
