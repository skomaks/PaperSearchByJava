Recently, Natural tissue or cell sheets have emerged as new strategies to construct periosteal substitute.4 Nevertheless, the fabrication complexity and high cost of cellsderived periosteum has resulted in the urgency to facilitate the acquisition and convenient usage of artificial periosteum.\nElectrospinning has gained widespread interests in flexible electronics,5–7 filtering,8,9 energy storage,10 and biomedical applications.11–14 Among them, electrospun-fiber-based biomaterials have been widely used in tissue regeneration owing to the structural similarity to an extracellular matrix (ECM), porous structure permeable to air and liquid, easy fabrication, and low cost. Furthermore, the small diameter and large draw ratio of\nne with antibacterial and osteogenic dual functions as biomimetic artificial 24-136, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nano.2019.01.002\nelectrospun fibers have provided the fibrous membrane with excellent flexibility,15 an essential property for artificial periosteum to cover the complex surface of bone grafts. However, over the past few years, the primary strategies in electrospun-fiber-based bone regeneration are primarily focused on the encapsulation of anti-infection16 or osteogenic agents (antibiotics,17 growth factors,18 and/or nanomaterials19,20). Because conventional osteogenic growth factors exhibit disadvantages of rapid degradation, high cost, and deactivation issues, it is unsurprising that the clinical use of these growth factors has been limited.21 Nanomaterials have been studied extensively in the medical field for applications of drugs and genes carriers,22 cancer therapy,23 gene therapy, antibacterial agents,24–28 antiviral agents,29 tissue engineering,30 medical diagnosis,31 medical imaging,32 etc., and have advanced the development of medicine and biology significantly.33 However, the biosafety of nanomaterials have always been the most concerning issue in recent years.34 Furthermore, studies that emphasized on the synergistic effect of antibacterial and osteogenesis in the process of bone regeneration are still in their infancy. Infections typically occur in the early stage of bone defect healing while osteogenesis is a long-term pathological activity after the inflammation period.17 Thus, the appropriate and sequential release of antibacterial and osteogenesis agents would be highly desirable for biomaterials to match with the process of bone tissue regeneration. In this study, the core-sheath fiber configuration was realized in time to endow the electrospun fibrous artificial periosteum with multifunctional and hierarchical drug release properties. The multifunctional artificial periosteum was obtained by coaxial electrospinning with encapsulation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride (MOX) in a gelatin shell and icariin (ICA) in a polycaprolactone (PCL) core. ICA, the primary component of the traditional Chinese medicine Herba Epimedium,35,36 was chosen as the osteogenic assistant to endow the artificial periosteum with osteoinductive property, while MOX was selected to provide the artificial periosteum with antibacterial property. Genipin, an excellent natural biosafety cross-linker, was used to crosslink the gelatin in the fiber shell owing to its fast degradation, as reported in our previous study.37 Both the coresheath configuration and the disparate degradation rate of PCL and gelatin can contribute to the hierarchical release of the two encapsulated drugs. This study aims to develop a multifunctional electrospun core-sheath fiber membrane and investigate its physical properties, in vitro antibacterial effect, biocompatibility, osteogenesis property, and in vivo osteogenic performance in a rabbit radius defect model. This work is expected to provide valuable information for the development of multifunctional fiber-based artificial periosteum."

The TEM micrographs in Figures 1, B and S2, A clearly show the formation of the core-sheath configuration. The fiber morphology and porous structure were maintained after genipin crosslinking (Figure S2, B). The crosslinking decreased the fiber diameters slightly from the range of 500–1000 nm to 400–800 nm (Table S1). The dark component inside the fibers was PCL; it can be used as structural support for the fiber while the gelatin shell can provide biological cues for the fiber.\nAs shown in Figure 2, A, MOX and ICA are crystallized with characteristic peaks located at 6–8° and 32°, respectively. For the electrospun membranes, the diffraction peaks located at 23.8° and 24.2° were assigned to semi-crystallized PCL, and the base lines were upward owing to the amorphous gelatin in the fiber shell. The characteristic diffraction peaks of ICA and MOX were absent in the electrospun membranes, indicating the homogeneous dispersion of both drugs in the polymer matrix.\nThe stress–strain curves in Figure 2, B show that the membranes were stretchable, a significant property for the artificial periosteum to bear the stress during the surgical operation and physiological process. PGMI and PGM possessed the tensile strength of more than 1 MPa, which is comparable with natural periosteum,44 as demonstrated in Table S2.\nAs shown in Figure 2, C, all the core-sheath fiber membranes indicated excellent hydrophilicity with contact angles of 10°-60°.

Subsequently, a second burst release of MOX was observed until the 14th day. The release profiles of MOX from PGM and PGMI were similar, but the release of ICA from PGI and PGMI were different (Figure 3, B). Twenty percent of ICA was released from the PGMI while only 5% was released from the PGI matrix in the first 24 h. As shown in Figure 3, C, the release of MOX was much faster than that of ICA from PGMI during the whole investigation period. The release of MOX was almost completed at 1 month while a slow and sustained release for ICA was still continued.\nThe in vitro degradation behavior of the core-sheath fiber membrane is shown in Figure 3, D. All the fiber membrane exhibited evident mass loss during the 2 months. The degradation rates of all the membranes were as follows: PGM\nNPGMI NPG NPGI. Approximately 60–80% of weight loss was achieved after 2 months of degradation for all the fiber membranes. Figure 3, E shows the morphology of the coresheath fiber membranes after degradation in PBS for 1 and 2 months. After 1 month degradation, the fiber surfaces of all membranes became rough and fractures were present only on the surface of the PGM fiber; after 2 month degradation, more fractures emerged on the surface of all the fibers compared to that of 1 month, but the general architecture of the fibers and porous structure was still preserved."

After cultured for 4 h, the cells adhered to the electrospun membrane successfully (Figure 4, D). PGM displayed the greatest potential to promote MC3T3E1 proliferation among all membranes (Figure 4, E). There was no obvious facilitation influence of PGI on MC3T3-E1 proliferation compared with PG. However, the cell numbers on\nall fiber membranes were increased during the 7 day culture. The morphology of the cells cultured on PGMI for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days indicated that the cells were growing healthily and could spread on the surface of the membrane without infiltrating into the thickness direction owing to the small pore size (Figure 4, F, G).

The highest OCN expression was achieved in the PGMI groups than in the TCP and other membrane groups (Figure 5, B). The incorporation of both MOX and ICA demonstrated a positive effect on OCN expression; thus, the highest OCN concentration was detected in the PGMI groups. COL I is an important structural component in the bone matrix and affects the mineralized tissue's strength and toughness significantly.45 No significant difference for the COL I expression was observed among the different groups after 14 days of culture (Figure 5, C).

      "text" : "Periosteum, a membrane that covers almost the whole surface of bone, is crucial in bone formation and defect healing. Periosteum transplantation is confronted with the challenges of availability, donor site morbidity, and immunological rejection.\nArtificial periosteum fabricated from natural tissue or cell sheets are viable choice for the facilitation of bone regeneration cooperated with bone grafts; however, the fabrication complexity, high cost, and storage problems should be addressed for them.46 Electrospun fibers mimicking the fibrous structure of natural periosteum is therefore a novel approach to better treat\nthe large bone defects. Electrospun composite membranes based on silk fibroin had been fabricated to form a synthetic periosteum but the osteogenesis performance was limited when only relying on the recognition of synthetic materials by cells.47 Besides, a biomimetic tissue-engineered periosteum was constructed via layer-by-layer bottom-up strategy utilizing PCL, collagen, and nano-hydroxyapatite composite nanofiber sheets seeded with bone marrow stromal cells.48 However, the fabrication of biomimetic artificial periosteum with antibacterial and osteogenic dual functions for bone regeneration applications is still in their infancy. In this study, electrospun core-sheath fiber was thus used to mimic the architecture and osteogenesis function of natural periosteum, accompanied by the bestowal of effective bacteriostasis function. Both the core-sheath configuration and different degradation rates of the fiber core and fiber shell were designed to provide favorable contributions for the controlled and hierarchical release of antibacterial agent MOX in the fiber shell and osteogenic agent ICA in the fiber core. The physical property and biological property of the electrospun dual drugloaded core-sheath fiber membrane were investigated comprehensively to better understand its clinic outcome.\nSEM and TEM confirmed the successful fabrication of the electrospun core-sheath micro/nano fiber membrane. After the crosslinking of gelatin by genipin, the fiber morphology and porous structure still remained. The pore sizes of the fibrous membrane are much smaller than those of the fibroblasts, which could prevent the migration of fibroblasts to the defect sites. Furthermore, the 60–90% porosities of all the fibrous membranes could sufficiently ensure gas and nutrition exchange.49\nXRD characterization clarified the homogeneous dispersion of MOX and ICA in the polymer matrix that would benefit the controlled and sustained drug release. The stretchability and high tensile strength of PGMI further facilitated its practical application in clinics.50 The improvement in surface hydrophilicity for PGM and PGMI compared to PG micro/nano fiber membrane was primarily ascribed to the addition of MOX that is hydrophilic owing to the presence of a carboxyl group. Surface wettability affects proteins adsorption significantly and could possibly supply beneficial cues for biomaterials to interact with dynamic tissues.51\nOur primary findings are that the electrospun core-sheath fiber composed of PCL core and gelatin shell can act as an effective carrier for MOX and ICA. The mechanism of drug release was based on drug diffusion and matrix degradation.52 These two drugs exhibited burst release during the first day, and were attributable to the drug diffusion in the fiber surface. The gelatin in the fiber shell was directly interfacing with PBS such that the release profiles of the encapsulated MOX in PGM and PGMI was similar. Meanwhile, the diffusion and release of MOX from the fiber shell would lead to small channels and defects in fiber, which could be favorable for water molecules to diffuse into the fiber core and finally facilitate ICA diffusion to the fiber surface. Therefore, it was reasonable that an evident difference was observed between the release rates of ICA in PGI and PGMI. In brief, the release of MOX in the fiber shell was not influenced by ICA in the fiber core; however, the release of ICA in the fiber core could be facilitated by the release of MOX in the fiber shell. The hierarchical release of MOX and ICA were\nachieved in PGMI based on the core-sheath configuration and the disparate degradation rate of PCL and gelatin. A longer diffusion path cooperated with a slow degradation rate of PCL contributed to the sustained release of ICA; in contrast, MOX in the fiber shell was released in a fast and high-dose manner until 1 month, as a result from the shorter drug diffusion path and rapid degradation rate of gelatin.53 The first week post-surgery presented a high infection risk; therefore, a high dose of antibiotics was desired, while bone-inductive factors would be necessary during the whole regeneration period. We conclude that the release profiles of MOX and ICA in PGMI could reduce the infection risk effectively once the defect was formed and simultaneously provide sustained osteoinductive factors for the long-term defect healing.\nIt is also necessary for implantable scaffold to synchronize matrix degradation with the replacement of regenerated tissues. The artificial periosteum was preferable to be used for at least 2 months to allow the successful regeneration of bone tissues.54 In the first 10 days, the mass loss was mainly primarily ascribed to drug release and/or the hydrolysis of gelatin on the fiber surface. From 10 to 20 days, the degradation of cross-linked gelatin in the fiber shell led to a sharp mass decrease in the polymer matrix. Subsequently, the mass loss was primarily resulted from PCL hydrolysis and degradation accompanied by a slow ICA release. MOX is water soluble and the encapsulation of MOX in the fiber shell accelerated the degradation significantly because the resulting defects from MOX release on the fiber surface would open more channels for water exchange. Briefly, the electrospun core-sheath fiber membrane could provide effective antibacterial cues during the first month and sustained osteoinductive cues for the entire duration while degrading gradually without interference to normal tissues. The in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxicity evaluation also proved that MOX released from the fiber shell could prevent the colonization of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria without any side effects on the cells. Moreover, the cells could adhere to and proliferate on the electrospun membrane despite the use of organic solvents, antibiotics, and crosslinking agents.\nWe also confirmed that the sustained release of ICA was beneficial for the osteogenic differentiation especially for OCN expression and Ca2+ deposition.55 It has also been reported that the antibiotics adversely impact cell viability and osteogenic activity.56 In our study, the encapsulation of MOX adversely affected the ALP expression, but the OCN expression and Ca2+ deposition were up-regulated significantly in PGM. The positive effect of MOX encapsulation in the fiber shell on OCN and Ca2+ expression was speculated to be the enhanced perception of matrix-driven cues on hydrophilic fibers.57 Furthermore, a significantly higher ALP, OCN expression, and calcium deposition were observed in all fiber membranes compared with TCP, thus confirming the active role of the ECM-like structure features of the fiber membrane. The most remarkable capability on promoting osteogenic differentiation was demonstrated in the PGMI group among all fiber membranes owing to the synergistic effect of hydrophilic MOX and powerful osteogenic promoter ICA, thus indicating its potential to be applied as artificial periosteum.\nThe in vivo experiments further demonstrated the effective role of the electrospun dual drug-loaded membrane as an\nartificial periosteum. All results from radiographic observation, histological, and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that PGMI possessed the most positive effect in enhancing the quality and quantity of bone formation as well as maturation when compared to the blank and PG groups. The comprehensive effect of fibrous matrix and hierarchical release of MOX and ICA both facilitated in obtaining the nascent bone with high quantity and quality, thus highlighting the great potential of this electrospun MOX- and ICA-loaded core-sheath fibrous membrane to be applied as an artificial periosteum in practice.\nTo summarize, we have developed a fibrous membrane with ICA and MOX encapsulated within a PCL core and gelatin shell, respectively, assisted by co-axial electrospinning. Through rational design of fiber configuration and polymer component, a biomimetic periosteum was designed that could provide antibacterial and osteogenic cues for bone regeneration. The fast release of MOX and sustained release of ICA could effectively inhibit bacterial colonization and simultaneously provide osteoinductive cues for bone regeneration by virtue of the core-sheath configuration and disparate degradation rate of PCL and gelatin. The electrospun fibrous membrane with the required mechanical strength and biocompatibility was also a viable supporting substrate for MC3T3-E1 cells to adhere to and proliferate on. Furthermore, the dual drug-loaded core-sheath fiber membrane clearly enhanced the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells including the osteocalcin and type-I collagen expression as well as calcium deposition. Further, the MOX- and ICA-loaded core-sheath fiber membrane displayed fascinating properties contributing to the in vivo bone formation in a rabbit radius defect model. Therefore, we believe that the ICA- and MOX-loaded core-sheath fiber membrane is promising as a multifunctional artificial periosteum for bone regeneration applications in clinics."

The physical properties, drug release, degradation, antibacterial property, in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis performances were investigated. Results demonstrated that stepwise and controlled drug release profiles were achieved based on the coreshell configuration and disparate degradation rate of PCL and gelatin. Only 20% ICA was released from this dual drug-loaded membrane after 1 month while the release of MOX was almost completed. Moreover, clear in vitro antibacterial effect and enhancement in osteogenic marker expressions including osteocalcin, type-I collagen expression, and calcium deposition were observed. Notably, the dual drug-loaded membrane displayed fascinating properties contributing to in vivo bone formation in terms of quality and quantity in a rabbit radius defect model. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
