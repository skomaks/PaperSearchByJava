      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "In recent years, the development of cataluminescence (CTL)-based gas sensors have drawn extensive interest, mainly because of the high sensitivity, fast response, long-term stability, and simplicity of the device [1–3]. CTL is defined as the light emission during the catalytic oxidation reaction on the surface of catalytic solid material [4,5]. This phenomenon was firstly reported by Breysse et al. in 1976 [6]. After that, Analytical chemists have made great efforts to promote the development of CTL. Nowadays, CCL was proved to be a powerful technology for rapid analysis, which shows promising applications in environmental analysis [7–9], food analysis [10–12], clinical breath analysis [2,13,14], and biochemical analysis [15,16]. Sensing material plays an important role in a sensor system, it interacts with analytes to induce detectable signals. The characteristic of the sensing material directly affects the sensitivity, selectivity and stability of the sensor. In 2002, Zhang et al. first introduced nanomaterials as sensing material into the design of CTL gas sensor, they demonstrated that nanomaterials can greatly enhance CTL performances, due to the pleasing advantages of high surface areas and high reaction activity for\nMolecules 2019, 24, 4275; doi:10.3390/molecules24234275 www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2019, 24, 4275 2 of 9\nnanomaterials [17]. Since then, many nanomaterials were prepared and used for design of CCL sensors. For instance, nanomaterial Zn/SiO2-based sensor for ethyne [18], nanosized NaYF4:Er-based sensor for ketone [19], sensor based on α-MoO3 nanobelts for diethyl ether [20], sensor based on nano-MgO2 for iso-butanol [21], sensor based on nanomaterial g-C3N4 for carbon monoxide [22], nanomaterial NiO for H2S sensor [23], nanosized ZnO-based sensor for propionaldehyde [24]. There are abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled breath, some of them have been identified as biomarkers of diseases [25,26]. Analysis of concerned VOCs in exhaled breath has been recognized as a useful method for diagnosis of disease such as diabetes [27–29], asthma [30,31], lung cancer [32–34] and breast cancer [35,36]. The most outstanding advantage of breath analysis is that the pain-free and noninvasive collection of sample represents minimal risk to the human subjects [13,37]. Gas chromatography or chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) are the traditional methods for breath analysis. However, these methods require complicated, bulky and expensive instruments, and their measuring procedures are also relatively tedious [38,39]. Sensors for breath analysis have attract wide attention because of their simple and compact device fabrication, as well as easy operation [40,41]. Examples include a WO3-based sensor for diagnosis of diseases [42], carbon nanotube (CNT)-based sensors functionalized with ionic liquids for infectious diseases [43], surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensor based on gold nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide for gastric cancer [44]. Exhaled acetophenone in human breath is considered as an important biomarkers of breast cancers patients [45,46]. In the present work, nano-praseodymium oxide (nano-Pr6O11) was synthesized by hydrothermal method. The prepared nano-Pr6O11 exhibited strong CTL response to acetophenone, but no or weak responses to other compounds. Thus, the nano-Pr6O11 was used as sensing material to design CTL sensor for acetophenone. The sensor showed high sensitivity to acetophenone with a limit of detection of 4 mg/m3 (0.7 ppm). We demonstrated that the proposed sensor can be used for analysis of acetophenone in human exhaled breath. To the best of our knowledge, this work is first report of a CTL sensor for acetophenone."

Although the detail reaction mechanism of CTL still remains uncertain, it is now well recognized that CTL emission must meet some requirements. One of the essential requirements is that the chemical compound can be oxidized to form a CTL intermediate, then the intermediate can produce photoemission when it returns to the ground state during the reaction process. It means that not all the chemical compounds can emit CTL on the same nanomaterial, even if they could be oxidized on the surface of nanomaterial.

Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were purchased from The National Standard of Material Resources Network (Beijing, China). The morphology of Pr6O11was characterized by using a scanning electron microscopy (Helios G4 CX). X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV X-Ray Diffractometer using CuKα radiation with a scan speed of 5◦/min ranging from 10◦ to 80◦. (λ = 1.54 Å, operated on 40 mA and 40 kV current). BPCL ultra-weak luminescence analyzer (Guangzhou Microphotonics Technologies Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China) was used to measured luminous signal. The luminescence analyzer equipped with a photomultiplier detector, a high voltage of 680 V was applied to the photomultiplier, the Data acquisition rate was set as 0.5 s.\nMolecules 2019, 24, 4275 7 of 9"

In brief, 3.0 mL of deionized water was mixed with 0.5 g of solid catalyst, then the suspended liquid containing catalyst was dripped onto the surface of a ceramic heater and was heated to 450◦ for 20 min. The ceramic heater coating with catalyst was put into a lab-made quartz tube that with a gas inlet and outlet. A voltage regulator was used to control the temperature of the ceramic heater by adjusting the output voltage. An air pump was used to support air carrier, and the flow rare was controlled by a flowmeter. The CTL signal was measured and processed by the BPCL ultra-weak luminescence analyzer. The detecting wavelength was selected by choosing optical filter. At the beginning of each series of experiments, the CTL sensor based on praseodymium oxide was heated to 450◦ for 10 min in air to activate the catalyst, and eliminate the influence of previous absorbates. Then the temperature of the sensor was reduced to a certain value for subsequent detection."

      "text" : "In summary, we synthesized nano-Pr6O11 via a simple hydrothermal method, and demonstrated that the prepared nanomaterial can be used as sensing material for CTL detection of acetophenone. The CTL sensor exhibited good selectivity, fast response, and high sensitivity for sensing acetophenone. The sensor was applied to the determination of acetophenone in exhaled breath samples, satisfactory recoveries in the range of 106.7–113.1% were obtained. This work provides a simple, rapid, and sensitivity method for sensing of acetophenone in many cases, especially in exhaled breath.\nAuthor Contributions: Q.-C.Z. and R.-K.Z. conceived and designed the experiment, and wrote the paper.

    "abstractText" : "In this work, we successfully developed a novel and sensitive gas sensor for the determination of trace acetophenone based on its cataluminescence (CTL) emission on the surface of nano-praseodymium oxide (nano-Pr6O11). The effects of working conditions such as temperature, flow rate, and detecting wavelength on the CTL sensing were investigated in detail. Under the optimized conditions, the sensor exhibited linear response to the acetophenone in the range of 15–280 mg/m3 (2.8–52 ppm), with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9968 and a limit of detection (S/N = 3) of 4 mg/m3 (0.7 ppm). The selectivity of the sensor was also investigated, no or weak response to other compounds, such as alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol), aldehyde (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde), benzenes (toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene), n-pentane, ethyl acetate, ammonia, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide. Finally, the present sensor was applied to the determination of acetophenone in human exhaled breath samples. The results showed that the sensor has promising application in clinical breath analysis.",
