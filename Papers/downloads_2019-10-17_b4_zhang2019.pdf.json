Assessment of the neurotoxic effects caused by urban PM is complicated by variations of composition from source, location, and season. We compared several in vitro cell-based assays in relation to their in vivo neurotoxicity for NF-κB transcriptional activation, nitric oxide induction, and lipid peroxidation. These studies compared batches of nPM, a nanosized subfraction of PM2.5, extracted as an aqueous suspension, used in prior studies. In vitro activities were compared with in vivo responses of mice chronically exposed to the same batch of nPM.\nThe potency of nPM varied widely between batches for NF-κB activation, analyzed with an NF-κB reporter in human monocytes. Three independently collected batches of nPM had corresponding differences to responses of mouse cerebral cortex to chronic nPM inhalation, for levels of induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglial activation (Iba1), and soluble Aβ40 & −42 peptides. The in vitro responses of BV2 microglia for NOproduction and lipid peroxidation also differed by nPM batch, but did not correlate with in vivo responses. These data confirm that batches of nPM can differ widely in toxicity. The in vitro NF-κB reporter assay offers a simple, high throughput screening method to predict the in vivo neurotoxic effects of nPM exposure."

      "text" : "Epidemiological studies consistently associate exposure to urban ambient air pollution particulate matter (PM) with accelerated cognitive aging and increased risk of Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [1–5]. Correspondingly, rodent air pollution exposure models show cognitive impairments, brain inflammation, loss of CA1 synapses, decreased glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 receptor, and increased Aβ oligomers [3,6–8].\nAmbient air pollution is globally monitored by the WHO as PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter of particles below 2.5 μm) [9]. The epidemiological associations of PM2.5 with aging and diseases are based mainly on mass concentration μg/m3, with little consideration of chemical composition. However, ambient urban PM is a heterogeneous mixture of particles with different sizes that vary widely in chemical\ncomposition. Moreover, PM2.5 bioactivities depend on how active chemicals are distributed on particle surfaces. The composition varies greatly among batches due to the variety of local sources, as well as daily variations in temperature, sunlight, humidity, among other environmental factors, [10–14].\nSeveral studies tried to predict PM toxicity in populations by composition and oxidative activities in cell-free systems [15,16]. The weak correlations of biochemical assays with epidemiological and rodent responses [17] has stimulated the development of in vitro assays that may predict in vivo responses; these assays include for mutagenicity [18], oxidative potential [16], cytotoxicity [19] and cytokine production [19–23].\nInflammation is induced in rodent brains by chronic exposure to air pollution PM [3,6–8], and oxidative stress is postulated to underlie the neurotoxicity of ambient PM2.5 [24].

We tested two forms of PM collected at different times near an urban highway in Los Angeles: PM2.5 collected directly as an aqueous slurry (sPM), and nPM, a nano-scaled subfraction of PM2.5 (i.e., ultrafine PM), collected on filters, and eluted by sonication. We also examined diesel exhaust particle (DEP) that is widely used to model PM for air pollution [26]. We showed wide differences on nPM batches for NF-κB activation, lipid peroxidation, NO production. The in vitro potency of NF-κB activation by nPM strongly predicted in vivo neurotoxic responses."

      "text" : "The potency of nPM (PM with aerodynamic diameter≤ 0.25 μm) and sPM (slurry PM with aerodynamic diameter≤ 2.5 μm) for activating NF-κB signaling was assayed with human THP1 monocytes transfected with a NF-κB reporter (THP1-Blue monocytes). The reporter is driven by IκB cis elements (NF-κB binding sites) that increase secretion of embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) into cell media (Fig. 1A). At 5 μg/ml, the maximal NF-κB induction for several batches was 10-fold or more above control (Fig. 1B). The batches of nPM and sPM differed 4-fold in NF-κB activation. DEP had weaker activity by mass, inducing NF-κB by 2-fold at 100 μg/ml (Fig. 1B), but not at 5 μg/ ml (not shown).\nSince lipopolysaccharide can activate NF-κB (Fig. 1B), we examined its possible contribution to NF-κB activation by nPM. Neutralization of LPS activity by pretreatment with polymyxin B attenuated nPM-induced NF-κB activation by 10–30%, depending on the batch (Fig. 1C); batches nPM-2 and sPM-2 retained activity after polymyxin treatment. Polymyxin B (PMB) is a cationic polypeptide that binds the negatively charged lipid A, the toxic component of LPS, thereby neutralizing its activity by reducing its binding to the LPS receptor TLR4 [27]. Thus, these data suggest that LPS carried by nPM only partly contributes to its NF-κB activation.\nTo further analyze NF-κB activation, we showed increased nuclear levels of the NF-κBp65 subunit (Fig. 2A). Corresponding to NF-κB activation, nPM induced cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 2B). The link of cytokine responses to NF-κB induction was shown by SN50, a specific NF-κB inhibitor, which suppressed cytokine induction by 65% (Fig. 2B)."

The nPM and sPM batches differed widely in NO induction (Fig. 3), ranging from no induction (nPM-7) to 8-fold induction (DEP-2), over controls. The DEP induced slightly more NO than nPM at the same dose after 6 h (Figs. 3) and 24 h (not shown)."

We assayed fluorescence of DPPP (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) for lipid peroxidation in human THP1 monocytes. Pre-incubation with DPPP embeds DPPP into plasma membranes [29], where it can be oxidized to the fluorescent product, DPPP oxide [30]. Again, we observed major batch differences at 5 μg/ml (Fig. 4), with lipid peroxidation ranging from 2-fold (nPM-1) to 12-fold (sPM-2) above vehicle control. Both batches of DEP had activity equivalent to the most active nPM/sPM batches."

      "heading" : "2.4. Comparisons of in vitro potency to induce NF-κB, NO, and lipid peroxidation",
      "text" : "The levels of induction for NF-κB, NO, and lipid peroxidation did not correlate significantly by batch at p < 0.05 (Fig. S1), while there was a marginal correlation between NF-κB activation and NO production (p=0.08). These data suggest that batch differences of in vitro\ncellular responses arise from independent processes from undefined compositional differences between air pollution batches.\nIn vivo neurotoxic effects are associated with in vitro NF-κB activity of PM.\nTo examine if in vitro activity can predict in vivo responses, we exposed the mice to batches of urban nPM and sPM used for the in vitro assays: nPM-2, 4, 5, and 6, and sPM-1, which differed in NF-κB activation (Fig. 1A). After 3 weeks exposure, nPM-4, nPM-5, and sPM-1 induced cerebral cortex responses, including increased IFNγ and decreased IL2 (protein level measured by ELISA), with the magnitude differing by batch (Fig. 5A). These batches were collected at the same site, but at different times (see Methods, Table 1).\nPrincipal components (PC) of responses were calculated for each mouse based on the changes of 9 inflammatory cytokines in the cerebral cortex. PC is considered as a latent variable of inflammation and represents a linear combination of the changes of the 9 cytokines. The NFκB responses in vitro were significantly associated with PC3, explaining 17% of in vivo differences by batch (Fig. 5B). In contrast, lipid peroxidation and NO production were poorly correlated with in vivo responses (Fig. 5C and D). This suggests that PM potency of NF-κB\nactivation could predict the long-term neurotoxic trajectories of the exposure.\nThe role of NF-κB was further tested by examining in vivo neurotoxic responses of mice exposed to nPMs with different in vitro NF-κB activation potency for 8 weeks. Exposure to nPM-2 that induced NF-κB in vitro by 12-fold also increased cerebral cortex soluble Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides, and hippocampal Iba1. In contrast, exposure to nPM-6, which induced NF-κB activity by 5-fold at the same dose, did not alter soluble Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides, and hippocampal Iba1 (Fig. 5E).\nSince oxidative stress is postulated in mechanisms of air pollutioncaused neurotoxicity [24], we assayed protein adducts of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), an established marker of oxidative stress produced by lipid peroxidation [31]. HNE-protein adducts did not change in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice exposed to either nPM batch for 3 or 8 weeks (data not shown)."

      "text" : "We examined the chemical composition of different batches for clues to explain the many-fold differences in activity. Metals, inorganic\nelements, water-soluble organic carbons (WSOC), and LPS were assayed in 7 batches of nPM and 2 batches of sPM, each collected at different times from the same site. The chemical composition varied greatly among the batches (Fig. 6), e.g. for nPM, iron varied 80-fold, and WSOC up to 300-fold. The components with highest variance were LPS, and alkali and alkaline-earth metals.\nThe nPM components associating with in vitro biological responses were identified by hierarchical clustering, using a dissimilarity matrix (generated from pairwise Pearson correlation) of biological responses and chemical subgroups of different nPM batches. This statistical method clusters objects by their degree of association (Fig. 6H). Among the analyzed particle components, LPS and WSOC had higher correlation with NF-κB activation than other components. The contribution of LPS to NF-κB activation varied from 0 to 30%, depending on the nPM batch. Weak associations were found between nPM components and lipid peroxidation or NO production (Fig. 6H). These data suggest that bulk chemical composition assay may not reliably predict the\nbioactivities of urban ambient PM."

      "heading" : "3. Discussion",
      "text" : "Batches of urban ambient PM had wide differences of NF-κB activation in a cell-based assay that correlated best with in vivo neurotoxicity. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to explore in vitro cell-based assays to predict particle-caused in vivo neurotoxic effects. Our recent review [17] discussed how epidemiologic and animal studies using ambient PM exposures fail to show correlations between bulk composition and in vitro oxidative potential and neurotoxicity.\nFor cell-based assays, we selected a human monocyte cell line (THP1 cells) to assess the pro-inflammatory potency and oxidative potential of PMs. Monocytes and macrophages are major cells that scavenge particles and produce inflammatory mediators in the body. The THP1 monocytes are widely used to study inflammatory responses. Compared to human bronchial epithelial cells and THP1-derived macrophages, the THP1 monocytes had stronger pro-inflammatory responses to nPM for NF-κB activation and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (data not shown). For NO production, we assayed microglia, the resident immune cell type in brain. NO production is increased in BV2 microglia by PM2.5 [33]. Most comparisons of cell-based and animal responses have focused on acute pulmonary toxicity of particle exposure, using macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells, which are directly contacted by inhaled PM [19–23]. There is considerable celltype specificity for mechanisms of phagocytosis and response to PM\n[34,35]. The inflammatory potency was assayed by NF-κB, a master transcription factor that regulates the induction of inflammatory mediators by air pollution PM (Fig. 1). Compared to assessing mRNA or protein of inflammatory mediators, this NF-κB reporter assay is more accurate, faster, and cost saving. NF-κB activation occurs in inflammatory responses common to all cells, whereas some pro-inflammatory mediators vary by cell type and animal species.\nMembrane oxidation was assessed as lipid peroxidation in THP1 monocytes by the DPPP assay, which measures combined effects of the interaction of PM with extracellular molecules, the cell membrane, and the surface chemistry of PMs. The DPPP assay minimizes confounds of other methods based on the oxidation of dithiothreitol, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein and other fluorescent dyes by particles in a test tube [17]. NO production was measured in BV2 microglia using Greiss assay [55], a simple, fast and widely used assay in NO studies. BV2 microglia were chosen for this assay because PM-mediated NO production was not detected in THP1 monocytes and because microglia are a major source of NO in the brain [36] and NO production was induced by urban ambient PM in BV2 microglia [33]. For both lipid peroxidation and NO, DEP had activity equivalent to the most active nPM/sPM batches, consistent with its in vivo neuroinflammatory activity following gestational exposure [26].\nIn vivo neurotoxic effects were assessed by cytokines (Fig. 5A) [7,37,38], microglial activation (Iba1) [37–39], and a neurodegenerative peptide (Aβ40/42), which are increased in mouse brain by chronic\nexposure to nPM [3,40–42]. As expected, the current data confirm that urban PM samples can vary widely in bioactivities relevant to neurotoxicity for NF-κB activation, lipid peroxidation, and NO-production (Figs. 1, 3 and 4), and for in vivo neurotoxic responses (Fig. 5). This unequal bioactivity/toxicity of particles collected from different sources, sites, and/or time has been observed by many groups [43–52]. It is generally thought that varying toxicity is due to composition differences [10–14] that alter particle-cell interaction, phagocytosis, and subsequent responses [34,35,53]. However, there is little definition of how each component may contribute to biological endpoints. The best correlations were for NF-κB activation with LPS and WSOC in the particles for in vitro cell-based responses (Fig. 6H). Specific components of nPM contributing to different cellular responses will be sought in future studies. Because ambient particles vary widely in composition, we may consider developing synthetic ultrafine PM with defined chemical components. Because the surface components of particles cause initial cell responses in vitro and in vivo, surface composition rather than bulk analysis needs to be evaluated for its biological activity. For example, NF-κB induction in THP1 monocytes was dependent on iron on the surface of natural silica particles, a small fraction of the total iron [54].\nCell-based inflammatory responses to predict in vivo lung responses to ultrafine PM have been examined by several groups [19–23]. These studies with different cell models were focused on acute responses of lung toxicity. The nPM batches with a higher potency of NF-κB activation caused stronger neurotoxic responses (Fig. 5), suggesting that the cell-based NF-κB activation assay is a better predictor than in vivo responses to chronic nPM exposure. Because THP1 monocytes are human derived, we suggest that the NF-κB assay could be useful for estimating neurotoxicity of human urban PM exposure.\nThe potency of urban PM for membrane lipid peroxidation or NO production was poorly correlated with in vivo neurotoxic responses (Fig. 5), suggesting that neither DPPP oxidation nor NO production is predictive for the in vivo neurotoxicity. Although we don't know how the inhalation of nanoparticle causes neurotoxicity, some evidence suggests indirect mechanisms via neurotoxicity carried by blood or lymph, lung-to-brain [36]. Unlike cytokines, oxidants and NO produced by airway cells are usually short-lived and detoxified quickly at production loci, and thus are unlikely to reach the brain at sufficient concentrations for direct responses [15]. DPPP oxidation in THP1 cells results from direct interaction of the particles with these H2O2-producing cells. These products are very low in quantity and unlikely to travel far from the membrane site of production. Although the lipid peroxidation measured by HNE-protein adducts was increased in some regions of mouse brain upon acute exposure to urban particles [38,55], we did not see 4-HNE elevations in mouse brain after chronically exposed to nPM (data not shown).\nIn sum, these three cell-based assays for biological responses to air pollution particles had limited correlation with in vivo responses with each other and with in vivo neurotoxic responses. The in vitro NF-κB activation was the most robust correlation with in vivo neurotoxic responses to urban ambient PM. A caveat is the small number of nPM batches available for comparison for in vivo neurotoxic effects, which cannot rule out false correlation between the cell-based assays and in vivo responses. Another limitation is the time-dependent changes of in vivo endpoint makers, which were limited to 8 weeks for Aβ40/42 peptides and Iba1. The NF-κB cell-based assay hold promise for predicting neurotoxicity in vivo."

These aerosols represent a mix of fresh and aged ambient PM, mostly from vehicular traffic. The filterdeposited dried nPM were eluted by sonication into deionized water, referred to as nPM [7,57].\nThe slurry PM (sPM) was collected using the aerosol-into-liquid collector, which utilizes the saturation–condensation, particle-to-droplet growth system developed for the versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) [58,59].

    "abstractText" : "Exposure to urban ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease and accelerated cognitive decline in normal aging. Assessment of the neurotoxic effects caused by urban PM is complicated by variations of composition from source, location, and season. We compared several in vitro cell-based assays in relation to their in vivo neurotoxicity for NF-κB transcriptional activation, nitric oxide induction, and lipid peroxidation. These studies compared batches of nPM, a nanosized subfraction of PM2.5, extracted as an aqueous suspension, used in prior studies. In vitro activities were compared with in vivo responses of mice chronically exposed to the same batch of nPM. The potency of nPM varied widely between batches for NF-κB activation, analyzed with an NF-κB reporter in human monocytes. Three independently collected batches of nPM had corresponding differences to responses of mouse cerebral cortex to chronic nPM inhalation, for levels of induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglial activation (Iba1), and soluble Aβ40 & −42 peptides. The in vitro responses of BV2 microglia for NOproduction and lipid peroxidation also differed by nPM batch, but did not correlate with in vivo responses. These data confirm that batches of nPM can differ widely in toxicity. The in vitro NF-κB reporter assay offers a simple, high throughput screening method to predict the in vivo neurotoxic effects of nPM exposure.",
