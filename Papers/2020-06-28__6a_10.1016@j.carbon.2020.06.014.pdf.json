      "text" : "The perfect control over the constituent and architecture of porous nanomaterials is\nstill a significant challenge in developing high performance electromagnetic wave absorption materials. In this work, we have designed and prepared a novel lightweight electromagnetic wave absorption material with the combination of hollow structure and bimetallic constituents by the thermal decomposition of metal−organic framework (MOF) ZIF-67. We found that by introducing additional metal Nickle into the porous Co/C composites, the CoNi/C-800-PVDF nanocomposite could yield an excellent reflection loss of -61.02 dB at 13.68 GHz and simultaneously possess effective absorbing bandwidth of 5.2 GHz with lower filler loading as 10 wt%, which corresponding to a less absorber thickness of 2 mm. These results demonstrate that the synergistic effects between the bimetallic components and hollow structure of novel CoNi/C composite optimize impedance matching, and thus improve the absorption performance greatly. The\nproperties of specific surface area, interface polarization, dipole polarization, ferromagnetic resonance, eddy current loss and multiple scattering are investigated to further explain the high performance of materials. Key words: microwave absorption; metal−organic framework (MOF); hollow porous structure; bimetallic carbon-based nanocomposites; impedance matching. 1. Introduction\nThe electromagnetic (EM) waves have received considerable attention due to their\nwidely potential applications in various fields, such as defense research, transportation industry, as well as daily life productions.[1-2] Meanwhile, the EM radiation has led a serial of serious problems, such as the interference, which threaten to the military applications and human health. As is well recognized, the development of electromagnetic wave absorbing materials has been a crucial role to address these concerns.[3] Normally, high-performance electromagnetic wave absorbing materials should exhibit strong absorption, a broad absorption bandwidth and a lightweight, etc. However, it is a great challenge to satisfy all requirements through regular composites because of the limited attenuation ability. To overcome the disadvantages, many researches have been switched to design multiple components materials with novel structures due to their significant synergistic effects between different constituents and good impedance matching.\nAs is known, absorption ability of EM wave absorbing materials depends on its\ndielectric loss, magnetic loss and impedance matching, which could be influenced by\ntheir structures[4] and constituents[5]. Therefore, rational construction of a favorable microstructure of material is firstly proceeded to improve the absorbing properties and upgrade the EM attenuation ability. Unique structure with low density and large surface area can greatly increase polarization centers, which is benefit to further enhance the dielectric loss ability by inducing surface polarization and polarization relaxation.By introducing the shell or pores to the material, it is effective to decrease the permittivity to enhance impedance matching.[6-8] For example, Li et al.[9] prepared the Co/C nanocomposites with hollow microspheres, which delivered a promoted performance with strong reflection loss (−66.5 dB at 17.6 GHz) and wide response bandwidth (over −10 dB, 3.7−18.0 GHz). Wang et al.[10] reported that the honeycomb-like Co/C composites showed the maximum reflection loss of −50.7dB and the effective bandwidth of 4.6 GHz at a 10 wt% loading. Additionally, our group fabricated core-shell NiS2@MoS2 nanospheres,[11] which could achieve a reflection loss of −41.05 dB with 4.2 GHz effective bandwidth. All the studies show that the structure does have a great influence on the EM absorbing performance. Exception for the structure, the composites consisting multiple components have also attracted more attention. Metallic magnetic materials can be widely used to prepare thinner absorbing materials along with high efficiency electromagnetic absorption properties due to the high saturation magnetization and high permeability at high frequency. [12-14] However, the single magnetic component material has only single magnetic loss mechanism and high density, which lead to the poor absorbing performance and applications. On the contrary, carbon-based\nmaterials are widely used because of their low density, high dielectric loss, natural abundance and excellent chemical stability.[15-17] Therefore, magnetic carbon matrix composites have been widely studied because of its great impedance matching and performance, such as Fe3O4@C[18], SiC@C[19], FeCoNi-graphene[20], FeCo@C[21] and FeCo@MoS2[16]. The maximum RL values of FeCo@C reached −56 dB at 1.85 mm and broadest bandwidth was 8.3 GHz. Excellent wave absorption performance was achieved for the FeCo@MoS2 composite with a maximum reflection loss of −64.64 dB at 14.4 GHz and a broad effective absorption bandwidth of 7.2 GHz at a small thickness of 2 mm. The results implied that magnetic carbon-based microwave absorbing materials consisting dual loss mechanisms have been a great candidate to achieve efficient and lightweight EM absorption because of good impedance matching. In light of these contributions, the perfect combination of the constituent and structure for developing high performance electromagnetic wave absorption materials is highly desirable.\nIn past decades, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with periodic coordination of\norganic ligands and metal ions, have drawn tremendous attention due to their specific natural advantages,[23-25] such as the high porosity, good chemical homogeneity of metal-carbon components and diverse morphology.[26-34] The most favorable aspect for MOFs is that they have been recognized as ideal templates to fabricate a promising EM wave absorbing materials, because the MOFs can easily achieve carbon-based magnetic composites with retaining their porosity and uniformity characters by controlling the in situ pyrolysis. Derived from Co-MOFs (ZIF-67), the prepared Co/C-500[35] composites\nexhibited the maximum reflection loss (RL) of −35.3 dB and the effective absorption bandwidth of 5.80 GHz (8.40 GHz−14.20 GHz), corresponding to an absorber thickness of 2.5 mm with loading of 60 wt%. Liang and coworkers[36] reported NiO/Ni/GN@Air@NiO/Ni/GN based on Ni-MOFs, which displayed great performance of consumption the incident EM wave with the minimum reflection loss of −34.5 dB at 17.2 GHz, when containing 50 wt% of as-prepared product. Though most of MOF-derived EM wave absorption materials possess excellent properties, the filler loading is higher than 30%, which is not benefit to large scale applications.[37-40]\nIn this contribution, we developed a novel lightweight EM wave absorption material\nwith the combination of hollow structure and bimetallic constituents by the control of a pyrolysis process of MOFs. This proposal is based on the following considerations: (a) the hollow structure would result in the large specific surface area, which is propitious to enhance interfacial polarization and multiple scattering and reduced the specific gravity simultaneously; (b) additional magnetic components as catalyst could induce amorphous carbon to graphitization, which is benefit to reinforce conductivity, so as to enhance the dielectric loss. Thus, the synergistic effect between magnetic components and carbon-based may show up good impedance matching. Additionally, we also optimize the annealing temperature for the thermal decomposition of Co-MOF (ZIF-67) to investigate the effect of thermal treatment on the properties of as-obtained materials and their final composites. As a result, when annealing at 800 °C, the EM wave reflection loss of the CoNi/C-800 system can achieve -61.02 dB at 13.68 GHz. It is worth to note that the\nfrequency range of CoNi/C-800 is achieved from 11.8 GHz to 17 GHz with only 10 wt% filler loading and an absorber thickness of 2 mm, which is much lighter and thinner than others published in literatures. In view of all advantages, the products can effectively attenuate the incident EM wave with a lower filler loading, which can be a good candidate of effective EM wave absorption materials."

      "text" : "Synthesis of ZIF-67. The MOF ZIF-67 precursors were prepared from Co(NO3)2\nand 2-methylimidazole (2-mIm) according to our previously reported procedures. First, 12 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 48 mmol of 2-methylimidazole (2-mIm) were dissolved in 100 mL of methanol, respectively. Then, the solution of 2-mIm was quickly added to the solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O. The mixed solution was stirred for 10 min and aged for 24 h at room temperature. The resulting purple precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol three times and then dried at 60 °C overnight.\nSynthesis of ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs. The as-obtained crystals of ZIF-67 (400 mg)\nwere dispersed in 250 mL of ethanol containing 800 mg of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. After stirring for 60 min, the core−shell layered double hydroxides ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs were harvested by centrifugation and finally dried at 60 °C.\nSynthesis of hollow CoNi/C. The as-synthesized ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs were\nannealed by gradient heating with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere in a\ntube furnace. Firstly, the samples were hearted at 350 °C for 2 h, and then at 600 °C (700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C for comparison) for 2 h, separately.\nCharacterization. The morphologies of the samples were observed using scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-1200EX) at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The phases of the samples were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded on a Rigaku D/max X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectra of the composites were collected using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi). The static magnetic properties of the as-prepared porous composites were measured by a Lake Shore 7404 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature. An Agilent PNA-N5244A vector network analyzer (Agilent, USA) was used to determine the relative permeability and permittivity in the frequency range of 2.0−18.0 GHz for the calculation of reflection loss. A sample containing from 5 wt% to 20 wt% of the as-prepared product were mixed with Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) used as the basement compressed into a standard ring with an outer diameter of 7 mm, an inner diameter of 3 mm, and a thickness of 2 mm for electromagnetic wave measurement."

      "heading" : "3. Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "In order to check the morphology and structure of ZIF-67, ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs\nand CoNi/C, the samples are characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD measurements, and the corresponding images are presented in Figure 1a-b exhibit the representative SEM\nand TEM images of the precursor ZIF-67, which are composed of well-dispersed rhombic dodecahedral morphology with an average diameter of about 500 nm and a relatively smooth surface. The XRD pattern (Figure 1c) shows the strong typical diffraction peaks of ZIF-67 indicating good crystallinity and purity, which is well identical with the previous report.[41-42] The as-synthesized ZIF-67 was reacted with Ni(NO3)2 to produce ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs at room temperature. Their representative SEM and TEM images are provided in Figure 1d and e. Apparently, ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs have polyhedral structures with rougher surface and smaller size, compared with ZIF-67. Based on Figure 1e, one can find the core-shell structure for ZIF-67@NiCo-LDH CSs. The formation mechanism of the core-shell structure could be explained as below: during the reaction, protons generated from the hydrolysis of Ni2+ ions can gradually etch ZIF-67 templates from the outside, and the released Co2+ ions may be partially oxidized by dissolved O2 and NO 3− ions in the solution. Then, the Co2+/Co3+ ions are precipitated with Ni2+ ions to form Co(OH)2, Co(OH)3 and Ni(OH)2, which lead to the Ni−Co LDH shells.[43]\nMeanwhile, we selected four thermal temperature (600 °C to 700 °C, 800 °C and\n900 °C) to explore the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the morphology of the products. First, the samples were hearted to 350 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1 under Ar atmosphere in a tube furnace. Then, the temperature was rise to different temperature with 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C at same rate, which lead to the four final products marked as CoNi/C-600, CoNi/C-700, CoNi/C-800, and CoNi/C-900, separately. After pyrolysis, the\nabsorption abilities. Moreover, TEM images identify that there are many heterogeneous nanoparticles evenly distributed in the carbon matrix, and the main particle size of products increases with the increasing temperature from 600 °C to 900 °C. The average sizes of primary crystallites are ∼10 nm for CoNi/C-600, ∼15nm for CoNi/C-700, ∼20 nm for Co/C-800 and ∼40 nm for Co/C-900.\nTo further confirm the structures with more details, the TEM and HRTEM images\nwere performed on the sample CoNi/C-800, which has the best microwave absorption property. TEM and HRTEM images of CoNi/C-800 were shown in Supplementary Figure 1a-b. From the HRTEM image, the ordered lattice fringes are clearly discerned that the gaps between two neighboring lattice fringes are approximately 0.20 nm, 0.17 nm and 0.12 nm, well assigning to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of Co-Ni alloy, respectively. The diffraction concentric rings of SAED pattern (Supplementary Figure 1c) also validates the crystalline nature of CoNi/C-800 as indexed as (111), (200), and (220) diffraction dots.[47] These results are well corresponding with the XRD and TEM results. The element distribution was verified by elemental mapping images. As shown in Figure 3b-f, the metal particles of Co and Ni exhibit the similar distribution, indicating uniform dispersion of the formed CoNi alloy in carbon layers. Additionally, the surface chemical composition and valence state of CoNi/C-800 nanocomposite was investigated by XPS. The survey scan spectrum in Supplementary Figure 2 indicates the existence of Co, Ni, C, N and O element in the CoNi/C-800, which is agreement with the EDS results. The proportion of each peak was also exhibited in the XPS spectra. As seen in Figure 4a, the\nspectrum of Co 2p shows two main picks at 794.3 eV and 778.4 eV attributed to Co 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively. The Co metallic state and the Co 2+ oxidation state of Co 2p3/2 peak are found at 778.3 eV and 781.0 eV. Another two peaks at 802 eV and 786 eV are attributed to satellite peaks. The Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 peaks are observed at 872 eV and 853 eV in Figure 4b, respectively. The spectrum of Ni 2p3/2 displays two peaks at 852.7 eV and 853.9 eV, which are identified with the metallic state of Ni and oxidation state of Ni2+. Two satellite peaks are found at 860 and 878 eV. As shown in Figure 4c, the high-resolution C 1s spectra reveals four peaks centered at 284.6 (C-C/C=C), 285.1 (C– N), 286.3 (C=O) and 288.9 eV (O-C=O). The N 1s spectrum in Figure 4d also is fitted to three peaks of graphitic N (400.7eV), pyrrolic N (399.3eV) and pyridinic N (398.6eV).[48-49] Finally, we determined that it was magnetic carbon composite uniformly dispersed by cobalt-nickel alloy. Previous results have proved that thermal decomposition is a useful method to convert MOF precursors to porous structures of metal and metal oxides.[15,50]\nThe surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples were investigated by\nthe nitrogen adsorption−desorption analysis. As shown in Figure 5a, because of inheriting the porous structure of MOFs, a typical type-IV isotherm and a distinct hysteresis loop with the high pore volume of 0.34 cm³/g indicate the presence of a mesoporous structure. The specific surface area is 135.22 m²/g, which is higher than that of the direct pyrolysis ZIF-67. The larger specific surface area will be benefit to the microwave absorbing property. The inset of Figure 5a was the pore size distribution. The pore size distribution\ncurves of the sample show a great deal of disordered porous with a size distribution from 1 to 20 nm. The distinct peaks centered at 3.894 nm imply the formation of mesoporous structure, which offers more active sites for polarization and scattering to enhance microwave absorption. After determining its porous and mesoporous structure, its magnetism is tested due to the presence of magnetic particles.\nThe magnetization studies were investigated by vibration sample magnetometer\n(VSM) to get the hysteresis loops, as shown in Figure 5b. The four samples displayed a typical ferromagnetic behavior with obvious hysteresis loops in the M−H curves. The saturation magnetization (MS) of CoNi/C-600, CoNi/C-700, CoNi/C-800, and CoNi/C-900 is 73.1419, 83.8706, 92.3599 and 95.2949 emu/g, respectively, which are higher than those of the reported composites derived from MOFs containing single metal. With the temperature going up, the CoNi alloy particles show enhanced crystalline, which endows CoNi/C-900 the largest MS. Meanwhile, the coercivity (HC) values of the CoNi/C samples vary negligibly. The HC of CoNi/C-600, CoNi/C-700, CoNi/C-800, and CoNi/C-900 is 294.4, 392.1, 277.8 and 312.8 Oe, respectively. The relative high MS and HC will contribute to the high frequency resonance so as to improve the EM absorbing property in high frequency field.\nIn general, the performance of the EM wave absorption material is evaluated by the\nvalue of reflection loss (RL) , which calculated by the following equation:[51-52]\n= 20 log (1)\n= tanh !\"# $ % √'()(* (2) where refers to the normalized input impedance of the material, )( and '( stand for relative complex permittivity ()( = )(+ + )(\") and complex permeability ('( = '(+ + '(\" ), d is the layer thickness, and c and f are the velocity and frequency of electromagnetic waves, respectively.\nTo investigate the absorption characteristics of the material, four kinds of\ncomposites were fabricated with PVDF as the polymer matrix. The processing conditions of composites were systematically studied with different filler loading (from 5% to 20%). The detailed results are summarized in Supplementary Figure 3. The optimal filler loadings for the four composites were found to be 10%, which was much lower than those of previous reports. The RL values of the four materials with 10% filler loading are shown in Figure 6a-d, and the corresponding three-dimensional diagrams of reflection loss with thickness and frequency are shown in the Figure 6e-h. It can be found that the minimum RL value of CoNi/C-600@PVDF is -31.5 dB at 6.08 GHz with a thickness of 5 mm. When annealing temperature was increased to 700 °C, the thickness of the material with best absorption performance was decreased to 3 mm, in which the minimum RL value can achieve -30.9 dB at 8.72 GHz. And its effective absorption bandwidth can reach 5.1 GHz. As the pyrolysis temperature rises, the frequency corresponding to the optimum performance gradually transfer from low frequency to high frequency with a gradual decreasing thickness. For CoNi/C-800@PVDF, the maximum RL is -61.09 dB at 13.68 GHz with only 2 mm thickness and the effective absorption bandwidth can reach\n5.2 GHz. It is also obvious from the comparison of different samples in Supplementary Figure 4 that CoNi/C-800@PVDF has better performance at same thickness and filler loading. The superior performance of CoNi/C-800@PVDF should be attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of the CoNi alloy as compared with previous studies. Whereas, the CoNi/C-900@PVDF harvests negligible microwave absorption ability due to the weak impendence matching. These results show that the sintering temperature has a great influence on the absorbing properties of the materials which can be optimized by adjusting the thickness and filler loading. Compared with other literatures in Table 1, it is worth highlighting that the optimized CoNi/C-800@PVDF exhibits both stronger absorption and broader effective absorbing bandwidth with only 10 wt% filler loading, which would benefit to fabricate the thinner and lighter materials.\nTo explain the amazing performance, we will analyze its dielectric parameters and\nimpedance matching. As is well known that the absorbing performance of the material depends on the relative complex permittivity and relative complex permeability, where the real parts of permittivity (εr′) and permeability (μr′) represent the storage ability of electrical and magnetic energy, and the imaginary parts of permittivity (εr″) and permeability (μr″) stand for the dissipation capability of electrical and magnetic energy. Therefore, the dielectric loss and magnetic loss are measured by tangent (tanδε = εr″/εr′, tanδμ = μr″/μr′) calculated by the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part.\nAs shown in Figure 7a-b, the εr′ and εr″ values of CoNi/C-600@PVDF decrease\nfrom 8.3 to 5.5 and 3.9 to 1.5. The CoNi/C-700@PVDF and CoNi/C-800@PVDF harvest\nsimilar value of εr′, decreasing from 11.4 to 6.6 and 11.6 to 6.4. However, there is obvious difference between their dielectric imaginary parts (εr″) of CoNi/C-700@PVDF and CoNi/C-800@PVDF , respectively from 5.4 to 2.4 and 6.2 to 3.0, which indicated that CoNi/C-800@PVDF may have preferable loss ability of electrical and magnetic energy. The CoNi/C-900@PVDF has the maximum value of εr′ and εr″, which can achieve 16.1 and 11.0. Compared to the εr′ and εr″ values of CoNi/C-600@PVDF, there is an apparent increase with the increasing temperature, which may be attributed to the increasing graphitization degree of carbon. All results are consistent with the XRD and EDS analysis. According to the frequency dependence of dielectric loss tangent in Figure 7c, it can be seen the dielectric loss increases with the rising temperature. The dielectric loss values of CoNi/C-600@PVDF and CoNi/C-700@PVDF decreased from 0.48 to 0.30 and 0.47 to 0.36, separately. The dielectric loss of CoNi/C-800@PVDF fluctuated around 0.5, while CoNi/C-900@PVDF shows growing tendency from 0.68 to 0.77. It is known that dielectric loss generally includes conductivity loss and polarization loss, which contains ion polarization, electron polarization, dipole polarization and interface polarization.[53] The former two mostly play a major role in high frequency (103-106 GHz), while the latter two mainly play a role in the frequency range of our study. It can be concluded from the previous results that the formation of CoNi alloy and the enhancement of graphitization degree can be contributed to gradual improvement of its conductivity leading to an increase in the conductivity loss. While the increase of graphitization and alloy particles also bring about more defects and specific surface\narea,[54] which are conducive to more dipole polarization and interface polarization, resulting in an increase in polarization loss. The hollow structure also plays a great role, greatly increasing the specific surface area to cause more dipole polarization sites and greatly enhancing the interface polarization effect. As a result of these multiple effects, the dielectric loss value gradually increases.\nIn addition to the dielectric loss, due to the existent of CoNi alloy, the magnetic\nloss also plays an important role in EM wave absorbing. Looking from the Figure 7d, CoNi/C-700@PVDF and CoNi/C-800@PVDF show better storage ability than others conclude from the higher μr′ decreasing from 1.40 to 1.20. The μr′ value of CoNi/C-900@PVDF goes up sharply to 1.0, on the contrary, CoNi/C-600@PVDF drops sharply 1.25 from to 1.0 and then they all keep fluctuating around 1.0. Except for CoNi/C-900@PVDF, as shown in Figure 7e, other three samples exhibit similar attenuation capabilities from their similar imaginary part values, sharply increasing from 0.10 to 0.38 on the frequency between 2 to 5 GHz. After 8 GHz, three of them fluctuated around 0.1. Because of the induced magnetic field by charges motion exceeding the original magnetic field, some negative values appear, which is also confirmed by some other carbon-based nanocomposites for EM wave absorbing materials.[55-60] The composite CoNi/C-900@PVDF only reduces the EM wave at 2-10 GHz, because the μr″ value is positive. And after 10 GHz, the μr″ value is negative which represents the EM wave reflected from the surface. Figure 7f shows that three samples display similar magnetic loss tangent value. According to the TEM and XRD results, the CoNi alloy\nnanoparticles enlarged with the increasing temperature, while induce the decrease of the surface. The increase of magnetism and the decrease of specific surface area working together lead to the little difference between the CoNi/C-600@PVDF, CoNi/C-700@PVDF and CoNi/C-800@PVDF. The magnetic loss usually originates from hysteresis, domain wall resonance, which can be excluded in the frequency range of the study, the eddy current effect, and ferromagnetic resonance.[61] If the magnetic loss is brought about by the eddy current effect, the C0 (C0 = μ″(μ′) −2f−1) values should be constant. For our samples in Figure 8a, the C0 values intensively vary in the frequency from 2-8 GHz ascribed to the ferromagnetic resonance. And all the samples keep a constant from 8 to 18 GHz, suggesting that the eddy current effect exactly plays the crucial role in magnetic loss. So it turns out that the low frequency ferromagnetic resonance and the high frequency eddy current loss together cause the magnetic loss.[62]\nThe impedance matching can be presented by the Zin/Z0. According to the above\nformula, the closer the values of Zin and Z0 are, the smaller the value of RL will be and the better the absorbing performance will be. As shown in Figure 8b, the impedance matching values of CoNi/C-700@PVDF and CoNi/C-800@PVDF are close to 1 after 12 GHz, indicating that they have great impedance matching ability to fabricate high-performance EM wave absorption materials. The CoNi/C-800@PVDF has better matching degree and its maximum absorption value corresponds to the frequency of impedance matching close to 1, so it would show the best absorption performance. Though CoNi/C-900@PVDF has a high dielectric loss, it gives the worst performance\ndue to its low impedance matching.\nAttenuation constant (α) is another important factor to evaluate the absorption\nproperty of the material, which can be determined as:[63-64] . = √ \"!$ )(\"'(\" − )(+ '(+ + 0()(\"'(\" − )(+ '(+ ) + ()(+ '(\" + )(\" '(+ ) (3) where f and c are the frequency and velocity of electromagnetic waves, respectively. From the formula, we can see the attenuation constant increases with the increase of frequency and the variation of attenuation constant also intensifies with the rise of temperature. As displayed in Figure 8c, the value of attenuation constant of sample CoNi/C-600 °C went from 38 to 145, while the value of CoNi/C-700 °C and 800 °C went from 46 to 207 and from 52 to 226, respectively. CoNi/C-900@PVDF possess the maximum α value, rising from 73 to 288. Although it can consume more electromagnetic waves, the final attenuation effect is not good due to its low impedance matching leading to too few electromagnetic waves entering the material. Based on the above results, composite CoNi/C-800@PVDF has higher dielectric loss, magnetic loss as well as better impedance matching degree, which result the superior EM absorbing properties with strong absorption and wide effective absorption bandwidth with lower filler loading. 4. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the hollow porous CoNi/C nanocomposites have been successfully\nsynthesized by a facile pyrolysis of MOFs-derived core-shell precursor. Benefiting from the formation of CoNi alloy combined with carbon material, EM wave absorbing performance was obviously enhanced by the strong dielectric loss caused by conductivity\nloss and surface polarization, and magnetic loss induced by ferromagnetic resonance and eddy current loss. By controlling the sintering temperature, we can tune the electromagnetic parameters and optimize impedance matching to obtain excellent EM wave absorbing materials. The CoNi/C-800@PVDF composite shows the best performance with a reflection loss of -61.02 dB and an effective absorbing bandwidth of 5.2 GHz at thickness of 2 mm with only 10 wt% filler loading. The results demonstrate that the strategy we proposed would open a novel pathway to design high performance EM wave absorption materials."

In this work, we have designed and prepared a novel lightweight electromagnetic wave absorption material with the combination of hollow structure and bimetallic constituents by the thermal decomposition of metal−organic framework (MOF) ZIF-67. We found that by introducing additional metal Nickle into the porous Co/C composites, the CoNi/C-800-PVDF nanocomposite could yield an excellent reflection loss of -61.02 dB at 13.68 GHz and simultaneously possess effective absorbing bandwidth of 5.2 GHz with lower filler loading as 10 wt%, which corresponding to a less absorber thickness of 2 mm. These results demonstrate that the synergistic effects between the bimetallic components and hollow structure of novel CoNi/C composite optimize impedance matching, and thus improve the absorption performance greatly. The properties of specific surface area, interface polarization, dipole polarization, ferromagnetic resonance, eddy current loss and multiple scattering are investigated to further explain the high performance of materials.",
