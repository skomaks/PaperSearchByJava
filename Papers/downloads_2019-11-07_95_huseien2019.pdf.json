The deterioration that happens in such concretes from the very beginning of the service not only life reduces their lifespan but also demands more OPC. Furthermore, the continuation and repairing are mostly laboured intensive and too expensive. Thus, self-recovery of the damaged concretes is significant concerning environmental mitigation and energy saving. Lately, nanomaterials based concretes have been exploited diversely in the construction engineering owing to their enhanced mechanical and durable attributes. The design as well as production of self-healing and sustainable concrete is an intensely research topic in nanotechnology. In this view, this article provides a comprehensive assessment on nanomaterials based self-healing concretes.

      "text" : "Cement industries that produce the main constituent of concrete remain the foremost concern to the world in terms of contributor for climate change and hindrance towards sustainability. Apart from USA, the fast-developing nations such as China, Indonesia, India, and Turkey are also causing major environmental pollution. According to Robert Hutchinson (2016), above 4 billion metric tons of OPC that is produced annually from numerous cement industries worldwide as basic constituent of concrete are primarily responsible for the major CO2 footprint [1–4]. Identification satisfactory and realistic alternatives are challenging task. In the civil engineering sector, OPC is broadly used as efficient binder in concrete and other construction materials. Meanwhile, OPC manufacturing is commonly accepted as the main provider of emitted greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [5–8]. International Energy Agency (IEA) reports suggest that it amounts to 6–7% of total CO2 emissions [8–11]. By the year 2050, the worldwide demand of OPC is expected boost to nearly 200% [8]. Mitigation of CO2 emissions from OPC related activities requires new types of sustainable, smart and environmental affable self-healing materials [12,13].\nIt is known that cement materials have very low resistance to aggressive environment and that is one of the most severe problems\naffecting the durability and service life of concrete structures in the natural climate. The effect of aggressive environment can manifest in the form of expansion and cracking of concrete. Sometimes the cracking of concrete may cause serious structural problems [14,15]. In this sense, the continuous increase in the durability requirements of the concrete structures led to the development of smart concretes (using self-healing technology) where excellent durability is mandatory [16].\nGenerally, self-healing is beneficial for the materials’ durability. Particularly, it is advantageous when human interference is difficult such as in construction purposes in the midst of harsh physical and chemical environments. Self-healing is also required to protect material characteristics especially in kinetic and thermodynamic conditions that support large defects density like nanostructures. Nanomaterials invariably reveal excellent functional attributes. Compared to ordinary materials, nanomaterials degrade faster due to the presence of numerous interfacial atoms. Many functional nanostructures can be combined to fabricate diverse nanosystems, wherein some components can also be incorporated to offer self-healing actions. In fact, this strategy is simplistic compared to the design of a more robust nanosystem [17]. Of late, due to the rapid advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology the design and fabrication of self-healing materials has taken new frontiers, wherein materials with particle size below 500 nm\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2019.01.032 Received 18 September 2018; Received in revised form 25 January 2019; Accepted 25 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Self-healing materials can recover from the damages autonomously. In many circumstances, the self-healing action can also be prompted via temperature as external stimuli, systems with this capacity are called non-autonomic self-healing materials [18].\nLooking at the future prospects self-healing concrete, this communication revisits the ongoing research activities on nanomaterials based self-healing concrete beneficial for future sustainable developments. Present paper is organized in three main sections. Section 1 discusses the importance of self-healing concrete towards more sustainable and smarter growth in the building sectors than the existing traditional concretes in terms of enhanced environmental friendliness and pollution reduction. Second section highlights some undertaken strategies of self-healing processes that disclosed repairing mechanisms with sophistication, elegancy and efficiency. Various mechanisms of selfhealing, benefits and drawbacks of every strategy are emphasized and compared. Section 3 deals with based self-healing systems as feasible solution of self-recovery mechanisms when active concretes are exposed to corrosion, deterioration, degradation and cracking."

      "text" : "Universally, OPC has been continually exploited as concrete binder and different building substances. It is known that production of OPC based concretes needs huge amount of fuel and raw ingredients that are acquired via resource mining and energy exhaustive processing [9]. This in turn causes great quantities of greenhouse gases (essentially CO2 and NOX) emission into the atmosphere. Per ton of OPC manufacturing, almost one ton of CO2 is created by consuming 2.5 t of raw materials and fuel [19–22]. Some estimates revealed that approximately 1.35 billion tons of CO2 is emitted per annum from the OPC production industries alone, accounting nearly 7% of the total greenhouse gases released to the environment [8,23]. Compared to CO2 levels in 2010, the CO2 emissions from OPC industries on the earth's atmosphere is going to be a major environmental concern because the global demand of OPC is predicted to grow nearly to 200% by 2050 [8]. Over the years, numerous strategies were adopted to reduce OPC manufacturing including the durability enhancement of concrete and elongation of service lifespan. In this standpoint, self-healing concrete is emerged as one of the gifted solutions to mitigate the OPC generated environmental pollution."

      "heading" : "2.2. Concrete durability",
      "text" : "Characteristically, the serviceability of construction materials has considerable economic significance, particularly with modern infrastructures and components. For urbanization, concrete materials that are greatly exploited must meet the standard codes of practices requisites’ related to strength and durability [24]. For instance, poor plan, low capacity or over-load, faulty material design and structures, wrong construction practices or unsatisfactory maintenance, and lack of engineering knowledge can often diminish the service life span of concrete under operation [25]. In the construction industries fast declination of concrete structures being a major setback necessitates additional improvement. Varieties of physical, chemical, thermal and biological processes are responsible for the progressive deterioration concrete structures during their service [7,26]. Several studies [27–29] revealed that the concrete performance is greatly affected by improper usage, physical and chemical conditions of environments. It is verified that both external and internal factors involving physical, chemical, or mechanical actions are often responsible for the deterioration of the concrete structures.\nMechanical damage of concrete structure occurs due to different reasons such as impact, abrasion, cracking, erosion, cavitation, or contraction. Chemical actions that cause the declination of concretes are carbonation, reaction associated with alkali and silica, alkali and\ncarbonate as well as efflorescence. Moreover, outside attacks of chemicals happen primarily due to CO2, Cl2, SO4 as well as several other liquids and gases generated by the industries. Physical causes of deterioration include the effects of high temperature or differences in the thermal expansion of aggregate and of the hardened cement paste. Other reason of deterioration is the occurrence of alternating freezing and thawing of concrete and the associated action of the de-icing salts. Physical and chemical processes of deterioration often act in a synergistic way including the influence of sea water on concrete. Poor durability performance of OPC in aggressive acidic or sulphate (especially in marine) environment is caused due the existence of calcium complexes. These calcium complexes are very easily dissolved in acidic atmosphere, leading to enhanced porosity and thus fast deterioration [30].\nIn many places worldwide, OPC structures that are existing for many decades are facing rapid deterioration [31]. Definitely, the permanence of OPC is linked with the nature of concretes’ constituents, where CaO of 60–65% and the hydration product of Ca(OH)2 nearly 25% is responsible for fast structural decay. Several studies indicated that occurrence of fast reaction of Ca(OH)2 in the acidic surroundings allows OPC to be deprived of water, leading to acid fusion and weakening of resistance against aggressive attacks. On the top, the intense reaction of evolved CO2 with Ca(OH)2 contribute to rapid corrosion of the concretes containing OPC [31]. The safety, service life, permanence, and life span of the mix design of concretes are considerably influenced by the cracks development and subsequent erosion. These distinguished drawbacks of OPC based concretes drove researchers to enhance properties of conventional OPC by adding pozolanic materials, polymer and nanomaterials so that it becomes more sustainable and endurable. The immediate consequence for affected concrete structures is the anticipated need of maintenance and execution of repairing [32]. Thus, there is a renewed interest for the development of sustainable concrete to solve all these existing shortcomings involving harsh environmental conditioning and durability."

      "text" : "Nowadays, cement is the primary workhorse in the construction sectors worldwide. Cement is processed at high temperature (≈1450 °C) in a rotary kiln by mixing limestone or chalks with clay. Next, the yielded hard nodules of clinker are crushed with low amount of gypsum using ball milling technique. Firing of such cement constituents at higher temperature needs substantial amounts of energy to be consumed (burning of coal or petroleum coke). Rapid decay of land setting, generation of dust during transport, creation of noise all over quarrying and processing of raw materials are regarded as major environmental concerns in OPC production. According to previous publications [28,33], OPC manufacturing devoid of considerable amounts of CO2 release is impossible. Actually, the CO2 emission occurs in two phases including fuel burning (to achieve very high temperatures of klin) and calcining (a chemical reaction occurs during limestone firing). Until now, even the most efficient cement production plant emits 60% or more of CO2 from various inevitable chemical pathways. The consumption of a considerable quantity of energy during crushing of cementitious raw materials in the clinker phase remains the foremost ecological distress in the OPC industries [34,35]. Undeniably, developing autonomic self-healing cement-based materials must be realized as a practical solution to the existing problems."

      "text" : "Low carbon emission and energy saving building material incorporated with smart material (in self-healing technology) is a wellknown candidate energy technology in enhancing energy efficiency and\nsustainability of building. The major aim of sustainable development is to keep livelihood on earth in the predictable future with absolute support or care so that ecological balance is not disturbed [36]. Sustainability is founded on three basic elements such as the economic security, environmental safety and societal benefits. Sustainable advancement must preserve these factors to protect the biodiversity with balanced ecosystem. In the present industrial uprising era, engineers, scientists, policymakers and architects are attempting to use resourcefully the sustainable model to reduce the negative impact on our ecosystem. Therefore, in the perspective of building materials the phrase sustainability used synonymously with robust or friendly and green environment [37,38]. In this viewpoint, self-healing materials have attracted increasing interest due to their potential to lessen the degradation, prolong the functional lifespan, and suppress the maintenance costs of materials [39,40]. However, the self-healing technology contributions directly to enhance the environment and reduction the pollution from increasing concrete life-span and reduction the demand and consumed of OPC as well ‘as affecting to saving energy and increase the sustainability of concrete."

      "text" : "During the past decade, the self-healing technique extensively studied and introduce as an innovative technique for concrete crack selfrepair. However, several innovative strategies to self-healing for cementitious materials have been proposed and developed. Nowadays, it is known as the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology which has been standardized in ISO 14040–14044. Thus far, it has been used for assessing the environmental impact of all kinds of products and services preferably from the cradle to the grave. The goal of this LCA was a quantification of the environmental impact reduction that could be achieved by using the proposed self-healing concrete instead of a more traditional concrete. Some direct benefits of concrete self-healing include the reduction of the rate of deterioration, extension of service life, and reduction of repair frequency and cost over the life cycle of a concrete infrastructure. These direct benefits may be expected to lead to enhanced environmental sustainability since fewer repairs implies lower rate of material resource usage and reduction in energy consumption and pollutant emission in material production and transport, as well as that associated with traffic alterations in transportation infrastructure during repair/reconstruction events [41]. Van Belleghem et al. [42] has reported the Self-healing of cracks with encapsulated polyurethane precursor formed a partial barrier against immediate ingress of chlorides through the cracks. Application of self-healing concrete was able to reduce the chloride concentration in a cracked zone by 75% or more. Service life of self-healing concrete in marine environments could amount to 60–94 years as opposed to only 7 years for ordinary (cracked) concrete. However, life cycle assessment calculations indicated important environmental benefits (56–75%) and mainly induced by the achievable service life extension."

      "text" : "In human body, injured surfaces (skins) and tissues are self-recovered due to the assimilation of nutrients that creates new substitutes to repair the injured parts. Likewise, in the self-healing of cements based materials essential products (acts as nutrients) are supplied to heal the cracks in damaged concretes. In the past few decades, intensive investigations have been performed to explore novel strategies for efficient self-healing with durability. Fig. 1 provides a schematic presentation involving the developed self-healing strategies for cementious materials.\n3.3.1. Hollow fibres Fig. 2 schematically displays the hollow fibres enabled self-healing processes. Hollow fibres store some functional materials’ components\n(acts as healing agent) inside of the empty spaces that form a composite network matrix [43,44]. When concrete structure is damaged and develops cracks under certain external stress or stimuli these functional elements so called healing agents flow out of these hollow spaces to repair the cracks instantly. Analogous to the arteries in living system, self-healing processes use hollow fibres implanted with the engineering materials of varying length scales depending on the damaged structures to be repaired [44,45]. For instance bulk polymers used in polymeric composites for self-healing purposes [46–49]. It has been shown that these hollow fibres or tubular structures are greatly effective for discharging the healing agents upon encapsulation [50,51]. To identify easily and speedily the internal damages in composite structures, Pang and Bond proposed a method called damage visual enhancement [49]. It was demonstrated that (Fig. 3) fibres packed with engineered healing materials and tagged with fluorescent dye can easily monitor the repairing progression.\nThe idea of biological self-healing mechanism such as bleeding can now be applied to repair the cracks of cementitious materials [52,53] appropriate. Using this concept, the functional components (healing elements) can be packed inside the fragile fibrous vessels dispersed inside the concretes network. Upon sustained damages these fragile fibres are broken and functional repair materials are released to initiate the self-repairing. Liquid methyl methacrylate in short MMA (is a methyl ester of methacrylic acid and a reactive resin) was embedded within hollow polypropylene fibres and then encapsulated inside the concrete [53], which could release MMA and reduced the concrete porosity. Some studies were conducted on the release of crack holding cementitious glue from hollow pipettes of glass inside the concrete immediately following the flexural test. Such concrete structures packed with glue/adhesive components were found to display about 20% more load carrying capacity than the one without glue following the flexural testing.\nSeveral researchers [52,54,55] independently clarified the buoyant process involving self-healing. To get a basic insight of the self-healing processes, hollow fibres (pipettes) were positioned within cementitious network matrix, where one terminal was connected to the self-healing mediator and another end was fastened. In this study, concrete mixes were designed [54] and glass tubes with respective external and internal diameter of 2mm and 0.8mm was positioned within the specimens. Both dilute (27%) non-dilute alkali-silicate mixture and 2 components combined epoxy resin of low viscosity were utilized for selfhealing component. Subsequently, this complex solution was loaded until the Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD) reached to 0.03–2mm after the elimination of the load. Next, these cracked samples were again cured to examine the improvement of self-healing ability. Compared to normal specimens (without healing agent) specimens that contained the dilute and non-dilute alkaline silica solution as the healing component correspondingly revealed a mean ratio of the strength recovery of 1.1 and 1.5. Conversely, specimens in the presence of epoxy resin displayed little improvement in the strength recovery ratio, which was much below the value that was obtained by direct mixing of resin and manual injection into the cracked regions (about three times better recovery). This observation was majorly ascribed to the inadequate blending and stirring of the two constituents, which produced the low healing ratio due to less hardening of resin. It could also be due to the presence of some residual epoxy that remained inside the pipes because of the sealing of one end.\nAccording Joseph [55], the testing regime was analogous except some insignificant distinctions. Bent plastic tubes with respective external and internal diameter of 4mm and 3mm were employed as the vehicle of healing mediator (Ethylcyanoacrylate). It was concluded that supply of such healing component externally could achieve self-healing successfully. After healing of the damaged area the stiffness after crack, the peak load and the ductility were enhanced considerably. Results during and after test revealed that, ethyl cyanoacrylate as adhesive could penetrate a large area of the fractured surfaces due to the\ncapillary suction and gravitational effects."

      "heading" : "3.3.2. Microencapsulation",
      "text" : "With the time, the man-made materials for encapsulation were developed from natural examples spanning from macro- to nano- scale. Birds’ egg or seeds are the simplest illustration of natural encapsulation on a macroscopic scale and a cell within it is an example on microscopic scale [57–59]. The growth of microencapsulation started with the synthesis of capsules comprised of dyes, which was then included in paper for the copying and replacing the carbon-paper [60]. Over the passage of time, several novel technologies have been developed in diverse areas. Microencapsulation is not considered as disconnected product or part of it, which is rather defined as the development of including micrometer size solid granules or liquid drops or gases within\nthe inert shell, isolating and protecting them from unnecessary reactions in the outside surroundings [61,62]. The implementations of microencapsulation with self-healing products were established [61,63]. Fig. 3a explains the self-healing idea, where the crack ruptures the implanted microcapsules, resulting in the release of healing agent into the crack surfaces via capillary action. Thereafter, the healing agent comes in contact with the embedded catalyst, inducing polymerization and thus closing of the surrounding cracks. Fig. 3b displays a typical cracked microcapsule image.\nNishiwaki [64] reported the filling of microcapsules using epoxy resin as healing material where the shell of urea–formaldehyde formalin in the size range of 20–70 µm was incorporated. These microcapsules plus acrylic-resin (an hardener in the form of gelatin shell of size range of 125–297 µm) were employed. It was shown that\nmicrocapsules incorporated with sodium silicate were effective for selfhealing [65]. In this work, concrete was first stacked to almost the breaking point before the load was removed and then cured for 1 week. Results revealed the concrete with 2% sodium silicate microencapsulation could recover as much as 26% of its actual strength compared to the reference sample (recovery of 10% only). It was concluded that by growing the healing material's amount even upper strength recovery ratio could be attained. Jianying Yu et. al [66] inspected the one-component microcapsules were prepared with toluenedi-isocyanate (TDI) as the healing agent and paraffin as the shell. The results indicted d that the TDI was successfully encapsulated in the paraffin shell and The mortars with the microcapsules showed more favorable self-healing capacity."

      "text" : "Kishi et al. [67] reported the creation of cementitious materials such as Al2O3–Fe2O3-tri (AFt), Al2O3–Fe2O3-mono (AFm) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the cracked concrete and air voids of Ca(OH)2 crystals. It was assumed that such hydration yields could leached out and re-crystallize in the flown water through the fractures. According to this idea, Kishi and co-workers [67–69] evaluated the self-healing concrete performance with different healing agents. Expansive agent, geo-materials and chemical mixtures together with their blends were included in the investigation of agents [69,70]. A comparison of the reference specimen was made with the specimen containing 10% cement substituted by expansive materials comprised of C4A3S, CaSO4 and CaO (lime) was conducted. It was revealed that for concrete beams containing expansive agents could almost heal the presence of an early crack of 0.22mm later than 1 month, in which rehydration yield among cracks was identified. Nevertheless, for the ordinary concrete structure these cracks were partially healed during the the same time period. Therefore, re-crystallization of expansive agents in air voids for selfrecovery was extra efficient compared to normal concrete [67]. Tanvir Qureshi et. al [29] reported that the expansive minerals improved the self-healing capacity of concrete mixes. The autogenous self-healing performance of any particular cement mix could be numerically predicted based on their hydration degree which is an indicator of cement mix state at any particular age.\nIt was also demonstrated that a geo-material containing SiO2 (71.3%) and Al2O3 (15.4%) when added to the expansive material could form a geo-polymer via polymerization of aluminate and silicate compleaxes individually [68]. Subsequently, these were dissolved at high pH due to the existence of alkali metals. Thorough investigation revealed that the size geo-polymer gel particles were below 2 µm and the cracked interfacial phases of the original ruptured zone generated numerous hydro-garnet or AFt phases (Fig. 5). Thus presence of expansive agent played a decisive role to bridge those cracks.\nFurthermore, EDX spectra displayed that majority of the modified geopolymer gel was existed in dense phase than the hydro-garnet one. Further study on chemical additives [68] indicated that the inclusion of NaHCO3, Na2CO3 and Li2CO3 to the standard concrete could enhance by cementitious re-crystallization and precipitation of particles in concrete. It was concluded that using proper amounts of carbonates and expansive agents, the self-healing attributes of cracks could considerably be improved."

      "text" : "In recent years, the utilization of biological techniques for repairing were proposed by introducing bacteria inside the concrete [71–75]. In the mid-1990s Gollapudi et al. [76] conducted a study and introduced an environmental friendly approach to repair concrete cracks, where ureolytic bacteria was incorporated to accelerate the precipitation of CaCO3 in the micro-crack areas in concrete. The microbes assisted precipitation of CaCO3 was characterized using several parameters such as the dissolved inorganic carbon contents, materials pH, calcium ions concentration, and accessibility of nucleation sites (accessible localized areas of reaction). The bacterial cell walls acted as nucleation sites and bacterial metabolism controlled the other factors [72].\nTittelboom and coworkers [72] used bacteria in concrete to generate an enzyme called urease that could catalyze urea (CO(NH2)2) into ammonium ions (NH4+) and carbonate radicals (CO3−2). In the chemical reactions 1mol of urea underwent intracellular hydrolyses to\n1mol of carbonate and 1mol of ammonia following Path I. Then, carbamate was hydrolysed spontaneously to form one extra mole of ammonia and carbonic acid via path II. These products later formed 1mol of bi-carbonate (HCO−3) and 2mol of ammonium (NH+4) and hydroxide (OH−1) ions (Path III and IV). Path IV and V was responsible for the enhancement of pH, drifting the bicarbonate equilibrium to form carbonate ions.\nCO(NH2)2+H2O → NH2COOH+NH3 Path I\nNH2COOH + H2O → NH3 + H2CO3 Path II\nH2CO3 + H2O → HCO−3 + H+1 Path III\n2NH3 + 2H2O → 2NH+4 + 2OH−1 Path IV\nHCO−3 + H+1+ 2NH+4 + 2OH−1 → CO3−2 + 2NH+4 + 2H2O Path V\nThe bacteria could accept cations (with Ca+2 deposited on the surface of cell-wall) from the surroundings because of their negatively charged cell walls. Then, the Ca+2 could react with the CO3−2 and led to precipitate CaCO3 at the cell wall surfaces which offer the active nucleation site (Path VI and VII). Using this approach of localized precipitation of CaCO3 via bacteria, the cracked surfaces could be repaired.

      "heading" : "3.3.5. Shape memory materials as self-healer",
      "text" : "Several researchers [77–80] revealed the usefulness of functional materials incorporation in cementitious concrete structures to achieve efficient self-healing. These candidates include shape memory alloys (SMAs) or shape memory polymers. The fundamental idea is that when cracks are formed then such materials with short predefined memory shape could shrink in a controlled condition, thereby generating a contraction to optimally act as cracks closure agent. Chang and Read (1932) identified a reversible phase change in gold–cadmium (Au-Cd) alloy which was referred as first observation on shape memory effect [80]. Over the years, several SMAs have been realized with excellent thermo-mechanical and thermo-electrical features [81]. For instance, Nitinol reveals super-elasticity together with shape memory effect refers by returning back to their predetermined shapes under heat treatment. In super-elasticity it undergoes an exceedingly large inelastic deformation and recovers the shape soon after unloading [82]. Wires of SMAs was used by Song and Mo [83] to get intelligent reinforced concrete (IRC). The post-tension effects in IRC were achieved by utilizing stranded martensite wires of SMA. The alteration in the electrical resistance of SMA wires was monitored to get the strain distribution within the concrete. Any cracks development due to explosions or earthquakes could be identified, wherein electrical heating of the SMA wires could reveal contraction and reduce the cracks, there could handle macro-cracks via self-rehabilitation. The concrete structure was intelligent enough to detect the self-rehabilitation and thus the name was coined.\nSakai et al. [77] examined the self-restoration process in concrete\nbeam by super-elastic wires made of SMAs. Results showed that the mortar beam containing SMA wires could recover about totally after sustaining a very huge crack. Likewise, shape memory polymers (SMPs) have been developed by Jefferson et al. to incorporate into cementitious materials [79]. When crack arises in the cementitious matrix because of early age shrinkage, thermal influences and/or mechanical loading then the shrinking process in the included SMA tendons can be stimulated by heating. This in turn can repair the cracks by developing a measurable compressive stresses across the closed crack surfaces. Such cracks closing mechanism can improve the natural self-healing processes and the durability performance of the structural elements in concrete. It was concluded that post-tensioned mortar beams via aligned shrinked polymer tendons could be effective for crack closing and weak prestressing. Results from several screening tests revealed that the most efficient tendons were polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Shrinktite with a shrinking potential of about 34MPa at controlled situations with 90 °C heating and subsequent cooling down to room temperature. The influence of heating together with extra curing could enhance the mortar's strength around 25%."

      "text" : "Recent developments in materials’ technology provide extra functionalities leading to the term of “intelligent material” which are characterized via desired response to some external stimuli such as temperature, light, humidity, etc. Innovative materials for buildings (coatings) have been developed and tested successfully [84,85]. Amongst these materials we may find coatings for self-healing concrete with specific durability properties. The technical of self-healing coating used with reinforcement concrete for steel bar self-healing and reduction the corrosion damaged. Self-healing coatings are a recent avenue of research that could provide a way to fight the deterioration of modern infrastructure. Conventional anti-corrosive coatings have limited effectiveness if even a small portion of the coating is damaged [86]. Selfhealing coatings, however, can continue to function due to their ability to heal after fracture [87]. In effect, this self-repair is anticipated to be able to greatly prolong the life of steel rebar structures. Initial investigation into application on steel rebar was conducted by Chen et al. [88]. This technology could be applied to rebar structures that are typically coated with epoxy coatings in the highly corrosive areas of the Northeast to combat rapid corrosion rates.\nIn the past, many studies have been conducted [12,13,26] to determine the mechanism of protecting the concrete roads, bridges and other structures against tiny cracks development. Yet, no conclusive remark has been made and thus remained as major issue. Cracks allow water, salt used for deicing and air to enter the concrete. During winter season, frozen water inside the cracks expands and made them bigger, speeding up concrete's deterioration in the presence of road salt. Many investigations have been conducted on self-healing anticorrosive coatings for protection of metals but no work is performed on self-healing protective coating for concrete. Self-healing coatings that initiate selfhealing through external cracking or damaging has seen substantial research. These coatings often have micro containers mixed in that can rupture easily when acted upon. The containers hold healing agents that then seal the crack and prolong the functionality of the coating. Containers that hold these healing agents can vary from polyurethane microcapsules to microfilament tubes and often have little effect on the\nmechanical properties of the coating. Research in this area has provided good results and application in real world environments can be further investigated [87,89,90].\nMany types of organic and inorganic materials used for this purpose. Epoxy coatings are widely used to prevent corrosive agents such as water and salts from coming in contact with rebar. The development of polymer coatings that react to environmental stimuli such as heat or pH changes to initiate crack healing has also been investigated [91,92]. Coatings that react to heat have achieved success, with some retaining all of their mechanical properties after multiple healing cycles [93]. As polyelectrolyte nanocontainer coatings, changes in the pH of the solution have been able to set a response within seconds [94]. Full recovery of the mechanical properties of the coatings were also achieved, making it a promising option for research in the future [94]. Drying oils such as tung oil and linseed oil have received significant investigation regarding their healing properties and encapsulation [95–97]. When exposed to air, tung oil will polymerize into a tough, glossy, waterproof coating. These characteristics have made drying oils a valuable component in paints, varnishes, and printing inks. Tung oil encapsulation was first achieved by Samadzadeh et al. [98]. These urea-formaldehyde microcapsules displayed good adhesion to the epoxy matrix, compared to industry standards, by testing the microcapsules pull-off strength following ASTM D4541-09. Testing of damaged samples to measure service life through immersion in sodium chloride solutions was conducted. Results were promising, as the tung oil microcapsules extended service life up to nine times that of epoxy coatings after damage."

      "text" : "In the early 1990s, the special class of concrete called ultra-ductile fibre reinforced cementitious composites was designed. Originally, it is known as Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) [99], which is constantly improved over the last two decade [16,99]. This material possesses high ductility (3–7%), tight crack size (about 60 µm) and comparatively low fibre content (roughly 2% or lesser by volume) [100]. Actually, metal-like feature is the significant mechanical character of ECC. It can sustain elevated loads after initial crack during auxiliary distortions. Li et al. [101] examined the self-repairing idea of Dry [52] related to bleeding which was used to discharge chemicals that could close the tensile cracks with subsequent air curing. This mechanism led to regain the mechanical properties of the un-cracked composites. It was acknowledged that the self-healing process was ineffective for usual concrete, cement or concrete reinforced with fibre. It is due the difficulty in controlling the size of the tensile cracks in these materials. Local breakages could multiply continuously inside the crack width under declining tensile load and exhaust quickly the accessible chemicals responsible for crack closure and re-healing. Therefore, effective self-recovery requires the control of the tensile crack width which must be restricted within tens of micros. Else, very large glass pipes are needed to modify the mechanical characteristics of composites. This argument was consistent with several other reports, that emphasized the role of cracks width [102–104].\nThe tightly controlled crack size being one inherent characteristics of ECC can offer advantages for applying the self-healing idea to ECC. Later, two different experiments were conducted [30] to examine the viability of the proposed bleeding notion. In the first experiment, the ECC materials with a single empty glass fibre free of any healing chemical were tested in situ at a loading stage under an FESEM. The idea was to confirm the sensing and actuation properties of ECC. The other experiment was performed to measure the flexural strength of ECC containing the glass fibres packed with sealing material (ethyl cyanoacrylate). Both studies were performed under MTS load-frames to ascertain the re-healing effectiveness of the sealing mediator after sustaining damage (fracture) in the load-cycles. The sensing and actuation processes were authenticated using FESEM images and the influences of revitalization were authenticated via flexural stiffness regain. It was also acknowledged that several other issues need further\ninvestigation before practical applications could be made. Li et al. [50,105,106] also examined the self-healing phenomena of cementitious materials in addition to the inclusion of external chemical as healing glue in concrete. The concrete matrix and its interaction with the exposed surroundings were examined. The ECC specimens were precracked and exposed to various environments such as water permeation and submersion, cycles related to wetting and drying, and chloride ions attack. Results revealed that the mechanical and transport characteristics was principally recovered, particularly for ECC preloaded with tensile strain below 1%. Apart from the tiny cracks, the small water/ binder ratio and the presence of great quantity of FA in the mixture could support the self-recovery action through hydration and pozzolanic mechanisms.\nThe ECC materials was locally developed from waste matters and/or by-products [107]. Several mixtures were designed using powders of blast furnace slag (BFS) as well as limestone (LS) and subsequently analyzed by measuring the tensile strain (2–3%) as well stiff cracks (with typical size< 60 µm). It was found that [108] the mixes designed by Zhou et al. [107] were dissimilar from the one casted by Li et al. [50] in terms of basic constituents (high proportion of BFS and LS instead of FA) and very high water to binder ratio in the range of 0.45–0.60 against 0.23. This indicated that the quantity of un-hydrated cementitious materials cured later than 28 days was much below the one used by Li et al. [101]. It was shown that ECC specimens made from great quantity of BFS, LP and reasonably high ratio of water to binder that could restore comparable self-repairing properties than ECC materials analyzed by high proportion of FA and low water to binder ratio. This observation was ascribed to the presence of tight crack width, wherein the self-healing of ECC was decided by the availability of un-hydrated cement and other complementary products including BFS. Therefore, low ratio of water to cementitious material ratio and high fraction of cementitious specimen were useful to support the self-recovery process. The significance of crack size was underscored in the context of constant hydration dependent self-recovery because it consumed very low amount of healing materials to close the cracks and was easy for the healing specimens to develop from both faces of the cracks for joining.\nCommonly, the micro-crack behaviour and the cracking chance of ECC in the presence of micro-encapsulated modules were found to improve, wherein healing materials were released. This assured the efficiency of the sensing and actuation processesthrough micro-encapsulation. The tight crack size in ECC is greatly significant because it needs low quantities of healing products for cracks filling and efficient for the healing products to develop from both facades for connecting these cracks. In short, ECC possesses higher fraction of cementitious materials and lesser water to binder ratio than conventional cements, thus more effective self-healer. Table 1 enlists the benefits and drawbacks of various self-healing concrete strategies developed in the past."

Using milling technique, high volume of nanoparticles can be produced. Though top-down approach is contemporary for nanofabrication, the consistency and superiority of the yields are often unpredictable. To overcome such drawbacks, the milling techniques (a top-down approach) can further be improved by increasing the number of balls, ball types, milling speed, and nature of the jar, where the quality of nanoparticles become better [128].\nHigh energy ball milling technique has been widely used to fabricate diverse nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nanograins, nanoalloy, nanocomposites and nano quasicrystals. John Benjamin introduced this technique to produce oxide particles inside the matrix of nickel superalloys (1970). Utilizing milling technique the properties of alloy component effective for high thermal structure was altered and mechanical strengths were improved. Factors including fractures, plastic distortions/deformations, and cold welds during the milling process affect the materials conversion into the desired morphology. Milling not only crushes the material into tinier fragments but also blends numerous particles or materials to transform into new phases with different compositions. Usually, the final yields of milling technique are in the form of flakes where refinements are performed based on the selected ball and milling standard. Most of the nanomaterials (nanosilica, nano alumina, nanoclay) utilized in concrete can be obtained via bottom-up approach, which is adopted for materials engineering at atomic or molecular levels via the self-assembling process so called molecular- nanotechnology or molecular-level processing. It is applied indirectly in nanomaterials and chemical production [32]. Varied morphology of nanoparticles obtained via bottom-up strategy is often customized through chemical synthesis technique. In comparison to top-down strategy, the bottom-up strategy can generate nanomorphology with more uniformity and reproducibility. Besides, using bottom-up approach one can produce novel nanocrystals with perfect atomic or molecular ordering. Bottom-up approach based production of nanomaterials are useful for achieving high electronic conductivity, optical absorption and chemical reactivity [129]. Through bottom-up strategy, one can get tinier size and formation of consistent surface atoms with modified surface energies and morphologies. Usually, bottom-up technique is exploited to prepare self-healing and selfcleaning nanomaterials with improved catalytic properties, sensing capacity and novel pigments characteristics. Moreover, the main drawbacks of bottom-up scheme is related to high running cost, need of experts for chemical synthesis and limitation to laboratory orientation only [130]. The nanoparticles produced using bottom-up approach is excellent for advance applications including electronic components and biotechnology."

Early strengths of pastes, mortars [131,135] and concrete [136] in the presence of nanomaterials were reported to be much higher than those formulated with conventional OPC. Development of such higher strengths were ascribed to the faster cement hydration process and pozzolanic reaction, reduction of pores density, and enhanced interfacial bonding amid hardened cement paste and constituents (aggregates). Nanomaterials were also exploited to reduce the porosity and enhance the durability properties of concrete [137,138]. With developing the concrete technology, the nanomaterials were used in many applications (Fig. 5) and the self-healing technology\none of the important application to produce sustainable and smart concrete."

It was shown that the strength of normal concrete tend to enhance with the inclusion of nanoparticles. The bulk properties and packing model structure of concrete can remarkably be improved via the incorporation of nanoparticle. Nanoparticles act as excellent filling agents through the refinement of intersection zones in cementitious materials and production of high density concrete. The manipulation or modification of these nanoparticles in the cement matrix can render a new-fangled nanostructures [139–141]. General deficiencies in the microstructures of concretes including voids, micro-porosity and corrosion originated from the reaction of alkaline silica can be discarded. The advancement of nanomaterials occurred due to their characteristics as new binding agent with particles sizes much tinier than traditional OPC. This property enhances the hydration gel product by imparting a neat and solid structure. Besides, using a blend of filler and extra chemical reaction in the hydration scheme, high performing novel nanoconcrete with enhanced durability can be achieved.\nThe application of nanotechnology in concrete is still in its infancy. Ever-growing demand for ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) and recurring environmental pollution caused by OPC enforced the engineers to exploit nanotechnology in construction materials. Classical blends of UHPC with incorporated silica fumes can achieve enhanced strength and high durability. However, limited accessibility and highpricing of nanomaterials not only slowed down the growth of UHPC technology but also made it less demanding compared to conventional high strength concrete (HSC). To overcome these limitations, nanotechnology enrouted production of UHPC emerged in its own right wherein an alternative to silica fume has been developed. Exploiting the nanoproduction idea, a typical nanomaterial mimicking the attributes of silica fume was designed. Nanosilica is certainly the newest material in nanotechnology based processing that has been used as substitute to silica fume [142]. Using this celebrated nanosilica component, several types of nanoparticles have been synthesized which are effective for concrete production [143], Nanoalumina [144],titanium oxide nanoparticles [145], carbon nanotube [146] and nanopolycarboxylates [147] are the emergent nanomaterials in the new nanoconcrete era. It is now customary to discuss about the production and possible applications of nanomaterials.\n4.4. Significance of nanomaterials as self-healer\nThe contribution of nanomaterials in enhancing the workability, strength and durability of building materials can affect the hydration kinetics of cement. Furthermore, the addition of nanomaterials can improve the performance of cement appreciably. The high performance of nanomaterials attracted the researchers to apply nanomaterials to create sustainable concrete by self-healing technology. The demerits of preceding methods are used for self-healing such as tricky to harden the bi-components healing system. The amount of healing materials packed inside the microcapsules was little. Strength of bonds amid the microcapsules and the cement network required to be stronger than that of the former. It led the researchers to resolve these problems and find another way to produce sustainable concrete with performance. In order to solve these problems, the merits of nanomaterials are presented in a nowadays, make the researchers in this field believe to these materials will be the best way for sustainable concrete."

      "text" : "Advancement of self-healing materials in concrete industries is an\nemerging trend. The generic term self-healing concrete is used for cement-based materials that repair themselves after the material or structure gets damaged via diverse deterioration mechanism. Nowadays, using nanomaterials for sustainable concrete also gets a lot of attention around the world. Compound the two technologies (selfhealing and nanomaterials) together contributed to enhancing the durability of concrete and successfully led to producing sustainable concrete [148,149]. Most application of nanomaterials in self-healing has been used to control the corrosion of steel bars in reinforcement concrete. Koleva [148] have been reported the ability to Improving reinforced concrete performance by incorporating nanoscale materials with tailored properties i.e. core-shell polymer vesicles or micelles in the cement-based system. Few researches have been conducted to using nanomaterials for self-healing concrete.\nQian et al. [150] studied the curing situations in the presence of air, CO2, and water in the wet-state as well as dry-state. Furthermore, the effects of nanoclay with water (used as inner water furnishing agent for hydration) on the micro-cracks were determined. Results revealed that the healing extent could be considerably superior with the inclusion of nanoclay and better cementitious materials concentration for mixes. It was stated that for all studied air cured mixtures, the final crack did not occur at the new location, indicating good healing. Despite the interior water supply from nanoclay it revealed comparatively weak strengthening, enabling it hard to relocate the final crack-sites from pre-existing one to another positions. This unproductive recovery with air curing was also reported by Hua [63]. It was shown that the self-healing behaviour of ECC with Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) capsules with water as the interior pool for extra hydration was effective. Meanwhile, various repairing products were recognized across the cracked facades. However, noticeable healed cracks were absent completely. It was acknowledged that the cracks could very likely undergo via the self-recovery mechanism without much effectiveness. The significance of enough water or moisture accessibility was highlighted that acted as the reactant for additional hydration as well as the ions transportation media."

In general, nanosilica (Fig. 6) was manufactured from micron sized silica. Strong reactions produced by nanosilica in UHPC are comparable to silica fume or micro-silica involving their strength, performance and durability improvement [151–153]. Qing and Zenan [152] demonstrated that concrete with nanosilica can gain early strength than that of silica-fume. It was shown that the incorporation of nanosilica in concrete could enhance its workability when the inclusion of super-plasticizers amount was lowest. Besides, nanosilica particles\nsize could act as ultra-filler inside the concrete, leading to dense and refined micro-voids to impart smart microstructures [154]. Other benefits involving nanosilica is the better control of water to cement ratio, wherein the strength can be customized easily. Quercia. et al. [155] reported the incorporation of nanosilica at certain dosage improved the strength of concrete and performed as cement substitution component. Nearly 20–30% of cement could be lowered via the implementation of nanosilica, thereby it can be a good substitute to cement. In self-healing application, the capacity of nanosilica to react with available Ca(OH)2 in concrete and formulate (CSH gel) was examined [156–159]. Using nanosilica the self-healing concrete technology as additional mineral admixtures or in nanoencapsulation method has been studied. However, the disadvantage of nanosilica is the cost and availability in certain nations where nanosilica need to be imported for usage in the concrete industries [32]."

      "heading" : "5.2. Nanoalumina",
      "text" : "In the cement hydration, it is known that the silica and alumina are two main components involved to formulate C-(A)-S-H gels with calcium. The role of silica inside cement was to alter strength whereas alumina controlled the setting-time. Nanoalumina is produced from alumina, where the use of nanoalumina in concrete is seldom reported. The inclusion of nanoalumina in concrete particularly high performance concrete can enormously affect concrete characteristics because it regulates the setting-time of cement [161,162]. Presence of nanoalumina within cement can accelerate the early setting-time for high performance concrete, which in turn diminishes the segregation and flocculation. In high performance concrete mixes, any disturbance in the cement creates inhomogeneity and affects the working performance. Nanoalumina in high performance concrete functions as dispersive mediator in cement particulates [163,164]. Besides, nanoalumina can refine the porosity of hydration-gel product as nanofiller because the cement proportion in high performing concrete is high. Therefore, grains size distribution in such concrete is essential simultaneously with silica mediated hydration. Without nanoalumina mediated refinement, the hydration mechanism is weaker since the silica component cannot penetrate the interior structure of the gel. Incorporation of nanoalumina can create a path for easy injection of the silica or binding materials into the interior microstructures of the hydration gel to start the refinement [165,166]. All these merits are mentioned above make the nanoalumina one of the important materials can use in future to produce smart and sustainable concrete by using self-healing and nanotechnology."

They possess atypical properties, which are precious for applications in diverse fields of materials science and nanotechnology [32,123]. Particularly, due to their unusual thermal conductivity, mechanical and electrical characteristics CNTs can be used as additives for diverse structural applications. NTs are affiliated to the fullerene family, in which the long and hollow construction with the walls created by one-atom-thick sheets of carbon so called grapheme makes them different. Such sheets can be rolled at definite orientations, where the revolving angle and radius together determines the attributes of CNTs [146]. Nanotubes are divided into single-walled NT (SWNT) and multiwalled NT (MWNT). Individual NTs are aligned in the form of ‘‘ropes” that holds them mutually by van der Waals forces or via pi-stacking [167,168]. These ropes make chemical bonds in the CNT structure, where the bonds of NTs are comprised alike the graphite. These bonds are much stronger than the one formed in alkanes and diamond, making CNTs exceptionally strong.\nFlexibility is one of the significant merits of CNT to produce sustainable concrete. Using CNT, the sustainable concrete design may be changed into distinctive or rigid type. Flexible nature of CNT is advantageous for enhancing the sustainable concrete strength. Compared to other nanomaterials, CNT is superior in terms of flexibility improvement and strength enhancement of sustainable concrete [146]. Predominantly, the dimension of CNT is tinier than other nanomaterials. The major function of CNT in sustainable concrete is to advance the stress and compressive strength [69]. CNT can use in self-healing concrete technical using Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) method and that will contributed to produce sustainable and smart concrete for future construction industry. Nevertheless, deficiency of CNT resources may trim down the attention towards potential concrete application of this material."

      "heading" : "5.4. Polycarboxylates",
      "text" : "In the past, polycarboxylates (PCE) nanomaterials has been utilized in concrete [169]. PCE is a polymer based compound that is obtained from methoxy-polyethylene glycol co-polymer. It functions in the secondary or side reactions which are reinforced to methacrylic acid copolymer as the major element. Usually, the carboxylate group is comprised of water molecule, rendering a negative charge alongside the backbone of PCE. The polyethylene oxide group provides a non-uniform electron cloud distribution and chemical polarities to the secondary or side reactions. The number and the length of secondary or side groups are can easily be changed. In case the secondary or side reactions possess numerous electrons it lowers the large molar mass and alters the polymer density, resulting in reduced performance of cement suspensions [32,170]. For both chains to combine and paired simultaneously, longer side groups and strong charge density from one to other reaction end must form. Usually, polycarboxylate is used in concrete as high range water reducer (HRWR). Inclusion of PCE allows in controlling the concrete workability better at lower water to cement ratios.\nThe characteristics of PCE in concrete rely on its amount, where elevated amount may cause in false setting without any hydration incidence in the concrete [171]. Aside, addition of PCE at required level can create Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) which enhances the workability of concrete. It also cxreates a flow concrete with enormous effects at small and elevated intensity region. Other benefit of PCE inclusion in UHPC or concrete is related to its capacity to be applied in marine atmosphere. Pores or voids in UHPC can remarkably be reduced to get more compact structure in the presence of PCE because it can eliminate air bubble and improves the concrete density. Furthermore, refinement of UHPC microstructure can avoid or reduce the permeability rate under marine condition, lowering the attack from sea-water containing sulphate and chloride ions. On top, the usage of polycarboxylate is regarded as relatively green strategy than the use of silica\nfume and other stabilizers in the UHPC microstructures refinement. Birgisson et al. [172] used PCE in HSC instead of silica fume to improve the workability and performance of UHPC. Additionally, approximately 70% of constituent materials in UHPC including silica fume, superplasticizer and fibre were reduced. Ultimately, it was shown that the incorporation of PCE within UHPC could improve the overall performance compared to pure UHPC or HSC. It was acknowledged that PCE addition of 2.5% of cement weight in HSC could rapidly enhance the early age strength. Consequently, on the first day the HSC strength was enhanced from 40 to 80MPa. Meanwhile, at 28 days, obtained strength was about 70–100MPa at low PCE level, which proved that PCE can act as a good substitute to improve the concrete performance. In short, simple management with least parameters or protocols of PCE makes it celebrated nanomaterials to be incorporated in UHPC."

      "text" : "Titania or titanium oxide (TiO2) has widely been used as pigment in foods colouring, paints, photocatalyses, implants, solar cells, and many other applications. Normally, it is resourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase phases and exists in nature as minerals’ phases such as rutile, anatase and brookite. At high pressure, TiO2 is transformed to monoclinic baddeleyite and an orthorhombic structures, recently discovered at the Ries crater in Bavaria [167,173]. Ilmenite and rutile form are the most abundant form of titanium dioxide-containing ore worldwide (98%). Heating above temperatures 600° to 800 °C one achieves the metastable anatase and brookite phases [174].\nIncorporation of TiO2 into UHPC and other concretes revealed remarkable influence on self-cleaning capability and contributed as green material implementation in engineering construction [173]. Jubilee Church in Rome (Italy) exploited this self-cleaning attribute of TiO2 in buildings, materials’ paving and product finishing [126]. TiO2 provides accelerated strength of concrete at early age, wherein the concretes performance and abrasion resistance both are enhanced [175]. TiO2 acting as glassy layer (extreme porosity) or pigment in the exterior of the particles in UHPC and concrete modifies their microstructure and thus the performance. Moreover, such layers can react with the hydration gel products in mixing by producing protective layers, thereby imparts self-cleaning capacity to the surface of concrete. This selfcleaning action of titania in the exterior and coated concrete surface make them extremely durable with permeability. This enhanced activity of titania incorporated concrete is regarded as fibre reinforced system that mimics the glassy fibre effect. It is realized that refinement and tailoring of the hydration gel via such fibres can be useful for the production of concrete with improved strength and prolonged durability [176]. Yet, health safety is a major concern related to the usage of TiO2 because of its dusty nature where small dosage can result in notable environmental impact especially to workers during packaging and manufacturing. Some reports exhibited that TiO2 generates inflammation and causes cancer to factory workers [175]. Consequently, it must be handled with care, particularly during mixing and process of TiO2."

      "text" : "Nanokaolin is a by-product of kaolin also called kaolinite, a very important industrial clay mineral with the chemical formula of Al2Si2O5(OH)4 [177,178]. This is a silicate mineral with many layers, where one tetrahedral layer is connected via oxygen atoms to another octahedral layer of alumina [179]. Kaolinite enriched rocks are generally called kaolin or china clay [180]. This clay encloses white mineral that called dioctahedral phyllosilicate that is formed by chemical changes of aluminium silicate minerals including feldspar [181]. For ceramic applications, kaolin is heat treated and altered into Al2O3.2SiO2·2H2O. After treatment or endothermic dehydration crystalline phase of kaolin is transformed to amorphous structures [182],\nwhere the new phase is known as metakaolin. IT contains amorphous silica and alumina with some hexagonal layering [183], which is very reactive pozzolan and reveals comparable reaction as silica fume. Furthermore, by refining the microstructure of metakaolin both strength can durability can be improved, thereby allows consistent water penetration. This properties make kaolin strong and cost effective than silica fume [32,184].\nNanokaolin is generated following either top-down or bottom-up approach, where the final product is influence by the processing conditions. Usually, the generation of nanokaolin comprised of layering or stacking flakes. Apparently, the kaolin particles are identical to the nanokaolin, where the morphologies after the size conversion from microparticles to nanoparticles offer wider surface area. In the concrete, nanokaolin is treated to form extra reactive or stable product called nanometakaolin. Being a newly used supplementary ingredient in concrete, presence of nanometakaolin improves the concrete properties unexpectedly [32]. The positive effects of metakaolin in UHPC and other kinds of concretes are demonstrated [138]. Morsy et al. [185] showed that nanometakaolin inclusion in concrete could improve the mortars’ compressive strength by about 8–10%. Interestingly, the tensile and flexural strength enhancement of mortar containing nanometakaolin was discerned to be nearly 10–15% compared to plain OPC [185,186]. Despite the advantages of nanometakaolin incorporation into mortars to improving the performance some shortcomings on the application of in UHPC were identified. Actually, lacking of raw kaolin in certain nations makes nanometakaolin unpopular than celebrated silica fume. Thus, standard guidelines and commercial protocols must be developed for large scale production of nanokaolin and nanometakaolin as useful nanomaterial alternative to concrete for serving the construction industries."

      "text" : "Nanoparticles of layered mineral silicates are called nanoclay. Based on these nanoparticles chemical compositions and morphologies, nanoclays are categorized into many classes including montmorillonite, bentonite, kaolinite, hectorite, and halloysite. It is one of the most inexpensive materials with beneficial outcomes in polymers. It is prepared from deposits of montmorillonite mineral having platelet structures of average thickness of 1 nm thick and width of 70–150 nm. It possesses many good qualities and an outstanding base material for nanotechnology manoeuvring. These notable attributes are the stability, interlayer spacing, elevated hydration and swelling capacity as well as strong chemical reactivity. Clays and their improved organic products can be analyzed via simple and modern instruments that can evaluate the chemical compositions. These tools include gravimetric analyser, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) or X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, cation exchange capacity (CEC) using standard ammonium acetate technique, surface area determination, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powdered X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and so on [58,88–90]. These clays are also distinguished via cation exchange capacity that can differ broadly based on the source and nature of clay. The clay purity can influence the nanocomposite behaviours. Therefore, it is significant to obtain montmorillonite with minimal impurities such as crystalline silica (quartz), amorphous silica, calcite and kaolin [187]. For the clays purification, several techniques have been developed such as hydrocyclone, centrifugation, sedimentation technique and chemical treatment [183].\nClays are regarded as economical and easily accessible materials. Despite their abundance worldwide, the guideline and methods for transforming clay to nanomaterials is not well documented yet. It is thus important to explore the constructional benefits and disadvantages of nanoclay as potential materials, although it has been diversely employed in the polymeric system. Nonetheless, the proof on the improvement in the material hardness, thermal stability, barrier coating, and solvents together with the enhancement in the electronic and novel\ntypes of materials are required. In the construction process, nanoclay is used as an additive to improve the mechanical and binding concrete characteristics. Morsy et al. [185] acknowledged that the enhancement in the compressive and tensile strength of mortar cement in the presence of nanoclay as additive. Furthermore, the thermal properties of concretes can be enhanced via the inclusion of nanoclay as cement additive in the paste [188,189]. Qian et al. [150] studied the inclusion of nanoclay with water (worked as the inner water provider to promote hydration alongside the microcracks). It was shown that the recovery level could be considerably improved with the incorporation of nanoclay in the mixtures. The mechanism of healing depended on the reaction between calcium hydroxide and nanoclay to formulate CSH gel led to healing the crack."

Surface coating of nanoparticles from diverse material can enhance the surface area by several orders of magnitude than their bulk counterpart. Particularly, silver is attractive metal because of its extraordinary size and shape dependent optical characteristics, efficient plasmon excitation, and high electrical and thermal conductivity in the bulk among all metals. These unique features allow silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) for potential applications in catalysis, selective oxidation of styrene, antimicrobial coatings, optical sensing, printed electronics and photonics. Ag NPs of dimension in the range of 1–100 nm find several applications in the field of catalytic processes, photonic devices, electronics, optoelectronic, etc due to their distinct physical, structural, morphological, chemical, electrical, optical, and magnetic attributes. On top, Ag NPs have widely been used as antibacterial and antifungal agents in biomedical field, in textile engineering, for water treatment, and several other consumer products [190,191]."

The attempt researchers to solve self-healing problems by using nanomaterials as the healing agent contributed to achieving many advantages. Moreover, deployment of nanomaterials in the self-healing concrete is an emergent concept. High performance of nanomaterials affects positively towards the enhancement and development the self-healing concrete. The applied nanotechnology led to develop a molecular model for the hydration products (C-S-H gels) of OPC [175] as shown in Fig. 7. As well as enhance of strength and sustainability of self-healing concrete using nanomaterials the controlled self-healing be better and the price of the material is considerably below epoxy-based materials.\nThe cost of self-healing concrete compared to conventional concrete still high even with using nanomaterials. Thus, self-healing concrete is a probable product for several civil engineering structures where the concrete cost is much higher due to better quality. For instance, in tunnel linings and marine structures wherein the security is a major issue or in structures in which there is limited accessibility for repairing and maintaining. In such special circumstances, even if the self-healing\nagents incorporated concretes cost higher it should not be too burdensome looking at the safety and future benefits."

It has been documented that over 2.6 billion tons of OPC was manufactured in the year 2007 [156] worldwide, amounting to above 17 billion tons. OPC was used in varieties of products such as building basement, walls, footpaths, lamp posts, bridges, dams, tall towers, skyscrapers, etc. to cite a few. Usually, concrete goods are proposed to achieve long lifetime and tolerant against local aggressive atmospheric conditions. Eventually, these concrete structures are mostly demolished and recycled at occasions upon reaching the final stage of their service life. Besides, in the building sector is such it is easy to apply process innovations instead of modernizations of disruptive goods. Manufacturing combines the products from varieties of supplies and skilfulness in a broad array of trading into a solitary completed structure. An alteration in the built structure can be evaluated by the construction corporation itself. Moreover, a considerably novel product produced by the supplier needs understanding and approval by the architects, engineers and the client before being applied by the skilled and trained on-site workers.\nSeveral factors must be accounted to develop nanotechnology enrouted concretes. Firstly, concrete and related products must be manufactured at large scale. Even if the cost of expensive concrete structures becomes lower it must be capable of handling massive material in a safer and environmental friendly way. Secondly, innovations required to be methodically developed with field testing to achieve the understanding and assurance in the construction sector. Lastly, structures of concrete are hard to destroy and need explosives or high-energies for breaking up. Thus, nanotechnology based concrete production should be compatible to these conventional practices. With these constrictions, the early nanomaterials implementations in self-healing purposes must render notable benefits in terms of extra functions with comparatively low quantities of nanomaterials. This low amount can be offered via standard construction practices and must not influence the the materials’ performance. Innovative products (smart self-healing concrete) must be able to advance the delivery of the traditional materials including the control of released admixtures in order to likely penetrating the marketplace."

Using nanomaterials based self-healing technology emission of CO2 can remarkably be reduced. Currently, world's development exclusive of concrete is beyond imagination [193]. History tells us that without concrete the wonderful structures like Sydney Opera House, the Chrysler Building, or Taj Mahal could not have existed. Furthermore, the skyscrapers in metropolis all over the world would have reached to such striking altitudes without the usage of celebrated concretes. In every aspect, durability of concrete played a remarkable role to erect those historic buildings centuries ago without modern technology and qualified engineers. Definitely, concrete in its own right is an integrated part of everyday life. Briefly, the manufacturing of smart and new concrete demands much money where billions tons of raw materials are wasted annually because inefficient production processes of concrete. Moreover, the production of OPC (primary concrete binder) adds to over 5% of the totally released greenhouse gases annually worldwide. It enforces threat to our environment where world development is striving for sustainable and green building deployment [194]. Therefore, the future aim is targeted to build cleaner, safer, efficient, reliable, and stronger smart materials alternative to concrete than the\nconventional OPC based concretes.

Thus, self-recovery of the damaged concretes is significant concerning environmental mitigation and energy saving. Lately, nanomaterials based concretes have been exploited diversely in the construction engineering owing to their enhanced mechanical and durable attributes. The design as well as production of self-healing and sustainable concrete is an intensely research topic in nanotechnology. In this view, this article provides a comprehensive assessment on nanomaterials based self-healing concretes. The past development, recent trends, environmental impact, sustainability, merits and demerits of several methods of self-healing concrete production are discussed.",
