Present batch study evaluates the adsorption of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) onto three magnetites having nanometric (M1-30 nm and M2-60 nm) and micrometric particle sizes (M3-1.5 μm). Obtained data revealed that particle size of tested magnetites strongly affected the extent and kinetics of metal adsorption and desorption. Observed order of adsorption efficiency was M1 > M2 > M3 with optimum monolayer adsorption of 408.14, 331.40, 178.47 mg/g (for Pb) and 228.05, 170.86, 83.49 mg/g (for Cd), respectively. Adsorption data were well fitted to the Freundlich (R2 ¼ 0.99), Langmuir (R2 ¼ 0.99) and pseudo-first order models (R2 ¼ 0.98). Electrostatic attraction and surface precipitation interaction via external mass transfer between bulk liquid-solid interfaces were the potential adsorption pathways. Pb showed higher affinity than Cd in multi-metal system. Desorption efficiency was higher in acidic environment (92%) than in distilled water (44%). Moreover, regenerated magnetite samples retained good adsorption capacity for six cycles. As soils are characterized by large variability of iron minerals, these findings have important implications regarding the transport and immobilization of contaminants particularly in the management of contaminated soils."

      "text" : "Presence of toxic metals in the aquatic and soil environment poses serious threats to the environment and public health (Hamid et al., 2019a, b). Situation is worsening in developing countries like Pakistan, where industries are disposing metal-contaminated wastewater into local water bodies without proper treatment (Murtaza et al., 2017). Contaminated wastewater is being used for agricultural purposes due to the prevailing water shortage which leads to the entry of metals into the agricultural soils and ultimately the food chain (Hamid et al., 2019c). Considering the non-biodegradable nature of metals, strong persistence\nin soils, and their higher tendency to bioaccumulate in living organisms (Fu and Wang, 2011), finding suitable strategies to address metal contamination has received significant attention among the scientific community.\nThere exist different remediation strategies with varying treatment efficiency. Adsorption is usually considered as an effective technique which can bind the pollutants in a quick and cost-effective way that reduces their bioavailability and toxicity (Hamid et al., 2020). Iron minerals are abundant in environment and are widely used for soil immobilization and wastewater treatment (Hamid et al., 2019a).

Magnetite plays a prominent role in dictating the mobility and toxicity of various pollutants and in biogeochemical cycling of trace elements in soil. It is amongst the highly efficient adsorbent due to its high adsorption capacity, stability and magnetic nature (Usman et al., 2018). Its ferromagnetic nature facilitates its separation from the reaction medium for pollutant recovery and repeated adsorption (Ajmal et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2019). It should be noted that formation pathways control the structural properties and composition of magnetite and, therefore, large variability of magnetite is found in natural soils and sediments (Usman et al., 2018).\nAdsorptive interaction of magnetite has been reported with different metal ions such as As (Yean et al., 2005), Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb (Nassar, 2010), Cr (Parsons et al., 2014), U etc. (Singer et al., 2012). However, limited information is available regarding adsorption of metal ions onto different magnetites that merits to be studied considering the existence of large variability of magnetite as micrometric and nanometric particles in natural and engineered settings. Adsorption efficiency is mainly dictated by characteristics of reaction medium and that of adsorbent. Structural variations and heterogeneity of a mineral could dictate its pollutant adsorption efficiency and ultimately the fate of contaminants in the environment. It should be further explored from both environmental and engineering aspects. Moreover, to our knowledge, impact of morphology and particle size of magnetite on their desorption/regeneration capacity and metal recovery is still missing in literature. Therefore, present study was conducted to explore the adsorptive interactions of Pb and Cd with three kinds of magnetite having different particle sizes and surface area characteristics. Batch adsorption experiments were performed to determine the effect of various adsorption parameters such as equilibrium concentration, contact time, effect of pH, temperature and competitive adsorption behavior. Moreover, to determine the extent and nature of adsorption, experimental adsorption data was further analyzed via adsorption kinetics and isotherm modeling. Finally, desorption of metal ions was also evaluated to explore the potential practical use of regenerated magnetites."

      "text" : "The effect of reaction time on metals adsorption by M1, M2, and M3 is presented in Fig. 1, which represents two phase kinetic adsorption behaviors. All tested adsorbents firstly exhibited a rapid metal adsorption. With an increase in reaction time, adsorption was dramatically increased, and saturation point was achieved at 180, 180, 360 min for M1, M2 and M3, respectively for Pb (Fig. 1a and b), and for Cd at 360 min for three magnetites. This could be correlated to the large number of available surface sites at initial phase of adsorption process which are saturated as adsorption proceeds. Owing to the existence of relatively larger driving force between metal ions and solid surface sites, higher metal uptake was observed (curve was more vertical at initial adsorption stage) in a shorter period of time to reach equilibrium for all tested adsorbents. This initial adsorption stage was generally known by external or instantaneous surface adsorption. Thereafter, the driving forces became weaker and the adsorption rate of metal ions slowed down. Overall, observed equilibrium point was smaller than many of the reported studies (Ozdes et al., 2011).\nFurthermore, the metal ions adsorption properties for all tested adsorbents followed the order M1 > M2 > M3, similar to that for the equilibrium point. The overall experimental data confirmed that particle size and surface area characteristics dictate the adsorption capacity of adsorbents. Owing to the nanosized particles and higher surface area, nano-magnetites could offer considerable surface-active site for efficient metal ions adsorption rather than that by micro-sized particles.\nThe kinetic models were used for the simulation of Pb and Cd adsorption data for all tested adsorbents. The non-linearized profile parameters and calculated regression values are reported in Table 2. Obtained data showed poor fitting of pseudo-second order and Elovich model to describe the experimental data. The range of R2 values of\npseudo second order and Elovich model for Pb and Cd were 0.75–0.94 for all tested adsorbents. The estimated qe, k2 and R2 are presented in Table 2. However, the metal ions adsorption data for M2 and M3 was better fitted to pseudo-first order model with (R2 ¼ 0.997–0.999) rather than pseudo-second order (R2 ¼ 0.91–0.93) and intraparticle diffusion (R2 ¼ 0.51, 0.65). Our results contradict with certain previous reports where pseudo-second order model was found to be the best fit for metal ions adsorption over iron-oxides (magnetite) surface sites (Wang et al., 2012; Bagbi et al., 2016). Depending upon correlation coefficient values (>90), the M1 adsorption experimental data showed better fitting to both pseudo-first and second order model for both metals (Pb & Cd) (Gerente et al., 2007). At the edge of saturation point, the adsorption process could be further controlled via other secondary pathways. They may include; pore or film diffusion that may possibly preside over the physical metal ions transfer from bulk liquid to the solid surface interface (Rehman et al., 2013). Overall, initial quick metal ions uptake onto magnetites surface sites via film diffusion (external mass transfer) is followed by a pore diffusion mechanism (intraparticle) until the equilibrium point is reached. The role of pore diffusion was further investigated by evaluating the experimental kinetic data by intra-particle diffusion model (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The plot between Pb and Cd uptake vs t1/2 indicates a bilinear trend, i.e. two straight lines (Fig. 1g and h). The first increasing trend line clearly indicates the mesopores and macrospores diffusion of adsorbed ions, while that of other line indicates microspore diffusion of adsorbed ions onto tested adsorbents. The experimental data between qt vs t1/2 at the initial stage show curvature, which is generally ascribed to the external and instantaneous mass transfer or boundary layer diffusion effects. This initial linear trend can be associated to the involvement of film diffusion. The intercept value obtained from linear portions of the plots back to the y-axis shows the measurement of the boundary layer thickness. The straight lines deviation from origin may be due to rate of mass transfer difference at initial and final stages of adsorption (Crank, 1965; Allen et al., 1989). Moreover, straight line deviation, which is not passing through the origin (C 6¼ 0), further indicates the non-significant contribution of intra-particle diffusion as a rate controlling step, which further suggests that metal ions adsorption was mainly governed mutually (film and intra-particle). This trend in adsorption kinetic intraparticle model indicates a significant contribution of two or more processes to facilitate the adsorption of metal ions species onto tested adsorbents surface sites. The qt versus t1/2 slope refers to the rate parameter characteristic of adsorption rate in the region wherever intra-particle diffusion is not the rate controlling step (McKay et al., 1980)."

      "text" : "The results of the effect of metal ions concentration for all tested adsorbents (M1, M2, and M3) are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 3. These results indicate that an increase in initial concentration of metal ions favors their adsorption (Co–Ce). The highest adsorption capacities were 38 � 1.04 mg/g (M1), 33 � 1.21 mg/g (M2), and 26 � 0.98 mg/g (M3), at highest concentration (170 mg/L). Meanwhile, the percentage removal rate indicated a tendency to decrease. Decreases in metal ion removal with an increase in initial metal ion solution concentration\nZ. Ajmal et al.\nJournal of Environmental Management 264 (2020) 110477\nwere 72–65% (M1), 63-56% (M2), and 53-44% (M3). It can be closely associated to the fixed amount of adsorbent dose (fixed surface binding sites) against increasing concentration (high metal ions availability in solution). Because, with increase in solution concentration, due to constant adsorbent dosage the amount of surface sites remains constant or lower as compared to increasing metal ions in solution. It could indicate a decrease in metal ions percentage removal rather than adsorption capacity (Co–Ce). Initial concentration makes the required driving forces available to prevail over the resistance to the mass transfer of metal ions between bulk liquid to solid phase. On the other hand, this could be better associated to higher gradient between adsorbate/adsorbent interface caused by the existence of larger driving\nforce by an increase in solution concentration. It promotes interaction between adsorbent/adsorbate with high adsorption capacity (Co–Ce) against fixed adsorbent dose (M) due to high mass transfer, thereby resulting into higher adsorption performance (Qe). Because, at low initial metal ions concentration, the more surface binding sites were available and many of them were vacant and thus these vacant surface binding sites were covered with an increase in adsorbate concentration. The incremental increase in adsorption capacity by increasing adsorbate concentration could be illustrated via Equation (2).\nAdsorption isotherm is imperative for the optimization of studied materials. The equilibrium relationship between adsorbate and adsorbent interface (ratio between amounts of metal ions adsorbed to its residual amount in liquid phase at equilibrium stage), are usually explained by adsorption isotherm. Therefore, the isotherm data was further evaluated by applying above-mentioned Freundlich and Langmuir equations. In order to describe the Langmuir model, it is important to determine the separation factor (Weber and Chakravorti, 1974), as essential characteristics of Langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant called the separation factor.\nRL¼ð1 = ½1þKLCoÞ (10)\nThe better fitting of Langmuir model explains that adsorbate species interaction mainly depends upon calculated separation factor regression values (R2), which represent favorable adsorption process (when 0 < RL < 1), unfavorable (RL > 1), linear adsorption (RL ¼ 1) and irreversible\nZ. Ajmal et al.\nJournal of Environmental Management 264 (2020) 110477\nadsorption (RL ¼ 0). The better fitting of Langmuir model for all tested adsorbents clearly indicates the feasibility of magnetite as an adsorbent. Thus, the calculated Langmuir adsorption capacity was higher than that of previously reported fly ash (0.22 mmol/g) (Papandreou et al., 2011) and chitosan-tripolyphosphate (57.33 mg/g) adsorbents for Pb and Cd ions (Ngah and Fatinathan, 2010). The Freundlich model also indicated the better fitting of isotherm metal ions adsorption data obtained from nano-magnetites. Furthermore, it indicates that the relationship between metal ions and nano-magnetites samples was primarily better simulated via both Langmuir and Freundlich models as reported in literature (Weijiang et al., 2017)."

The metal ions adsorption generally increased with an increase in temperature. The maximum metal ion adsorptions were achieved at 328.15 K for all tested adsorbents. Optimum values for Pb and Cd were 7.72 � 0.2, 7.34 � 0.34, 6.14 � 0.47 and 7.60 � 0.26, 7.25 � 0.47, 6.03 � 0.44 mg/g in the order of M1 > M2 > M3. Increase in temperature is considered favorable for the pore diffusion of unadsorbed metal ion species onto the tested adsorbents because of decreasing solution viscosity and high free energy availability, which boost up the adsorption at high temperature (Nassar, 2010). Moreover, at higher temperature, the diffusion of adsorbate (metal ions) from external laminar layer into the micro-pores of tested adsorbent increases between adsorbate and adsorbent surface functional groups."

      "heading" : "3.1.4. Effect of solution pH",
      "text" : "The solution pH is known to affect metals ion solubility, their ionization degree and adsorbent’s surface characteristics. The results of the metal ions (Pb & Cd) adsorption onto tested adsorbents are presented in Fig. 4a and b. The overall findings showed that at initial pH 3, the Pb adsorption was 1.35 � 0.15, 1.12 � 0.20, 0.71 � 0.11 mg/g, which increased up to 6.73 � 0.20, 5.86 � 0.18, 4.72 � 0.31 mg/g at pH 6 for all tested adsorbents. Similar trend of increasing adsorption rate with pH from 3 to 6 was also observed for Cd adsorption onto all tested adsorbents, where adsorption was maximum at pH 6 (6.68 � 0.29, 5.31 � 0.30, 4.25 � 0.19 mg/g for M1, M2 and M3, respectively). Similar findings regarding increase in Pb and Cd adsorption up to pH 6 and 5.5 are also available in literature (Ren et al., 2012; Weijiang et al., 2017). In adsorption, pH affects protonation of surface groups and speciation of metal ions in the solution (Repo et al., 2010). The low adsorption of both\nPb and Cd in acidic medium was attributed to the competition between positively charged metal ion species and protons (Hþ) ions onto tested adsorbents surfaces. Moreover, in lower pH range, there are more positively charged surface active sites and repulsive forces become dominant between adsorbent/adsorbate interfaces and thereby reduce the adsorption capacity at pH ˂ 6 (Singla and Chawla, 2001; Tang et al., 2009). As reported by Cornell and Schwertmann (2003), Fe3O4 may further produce Fe(II) and its hydrolysis products in the form of (FeOHþ), Fe(OH)2-, and Fe(OH)3) mainly depending upon solution pH. Herein, the different magnetites surface sites (PZC) presented in Table 1 indicate that dominant surface functional groups would be (FeOH)2- at pH < PZC (Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). The incremental increase in metal adsorption with an increase in pH up to 6, may be due to lower competition of positively charged metal ions and the protons (Paulino et al., 2008). Because, increase in pH value from 3 to 6 enhances the adsorbent surface sited protonation, and thus yields more negatively-charged adsorbent surface sites. These negative surface charges are responsible for incremental increase in attractive forces between adsorbent/adsorbate to attain maximum adsorption capacity only up to pH 6 (Cheng et al., 2012). The pH dependent maximum Pb adsorption onto γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 was achieved at pH � 5.5 in the presence of competitive ions (Cd) (Roonasi and Holmgren, 2009). When the solution pH increased beyond 6, adsorption started to decrease. It might be associated to the precipitation of metal with an increase in pH, which decreased their adsorption as observed previously (Farghali et al., 2013)."

Thereafter, the adsorption rate for both metal ions tended to decrease as compared to the monometallic systems at constant ionic strength due to their competition for surface-active adsorption sites as reported elsewhere (Badruddoza et al., 2013). It was also observed that adsorption of Pb was higher than that of Cd ions for three adsorbents. It should be noted that the competitive adsorption aptitude differs from metal to metal, mainly depending upon several factors i.e. ion charges, molecular mass, metal hydration energy, and hydrated ionic radius (Qin et al., 2006).

      "text" : "Metal ions desorption from saturated particles was investigated by using distilled water and acidic solution through Equation (3) and obtained results are presented in Fig. 6(a and b). The metal ions desorption in distilled water for Pb and Cd was found to be almost 44, 38, 37 and 41, 36, 34% by M2, M1 and M3, respectively. On the other hand, desorption in acidic environment followed the order M2 > M3 > M1, with maximum desorption percentage 91, 87, 82 and 92, 89, 82% for Pb and\nCd, respectively. The better desorption in acidic environment can be attributed to higher Hþ ions leading to higher positively charged surface sites (Ren et al., 2012). Moreover, observed incomplete regeneration might be caused by chemical reaction (i.e. oxidation and passivation of magnetite) during adsorption/desorption cycles (Javadian et al., 2015). Conversely, the slightly lower desorption percentage of M1 might be associated to its porous nature arising from its parent mineral, ferrihydrite (Usman et al., 2012). It further indicates that the adsorbed metal ions have stronger bond with fine pores of tested adsorbent, which could lead to a difficult desorption even in strong acidic solution. It further emphasizes the need to investigate the impact of time onto the nature of adsorbents for subsequent adsorption/desorption cycles. Taking into the account the desorption from all tested adsorbents, M2 achieved more desorption (%) that can be associated to its higher stability.\nMoreover, adsorption potential of regenerated adsorbents (after 1st adsorption cycle) was comparable to that of freshly-prepared adsorbents, whereas about 10–20% decrease in adsorption efficiency was observed after six adsorption/desorption cycles (Fig. 6). This considerable adsorption performance with consecutive regeneration cycles indicates the breakdown of large bulks into small ones, which led to the exposure of more surface binding sites for adsorption (Ren et al., 2012). On the other hand, slightly lower adsorption percentage of reused adsorbents can be attributed to the existence of already occupied surface active sites or the loss of porosity. Many researchers have reported the similar phenomenon of decreased adsorption performance in reusability tests, which was correlated to the erosion of adsorbent surface sites\nZ. Ajmal et al.\nJournal of Environmental Management 264 (2020) 110477\nleading to the loss of adsorbent porosity during metal ion adsorption and nutrient recovery analysis onto iron oxides and biochar-based adsorbents (Nassar, 2010; Kizito et al., 2017; Ajmal et al., 2018). Similarly, slight decrease in adsorption performance of zeolite based geopolymers adsorbent for Cd removal from aqueous solution has already been reported (Javadian et al., 2015). Taking into the account of all the desorption data; it is evident that M1 and M2 showed better desorption efficiency than M3. It is important to note that regeneration of saturated adsorbents can significantly reduce the treatment cost as it can be an expensive step during adsorption process accounting for about 75% of the total maintenance and operating cost (Inglezakis and Poulopoulos, 2006). However, consecutive regeneration of magnetite has been noted with considerable adsorption performance in present study."

      "text" : "Present study reports superior metal ions adsorption by nanomagnetites (M1 and M2) than that by micro-magnetite (M3) (M1 > M2 > M3) thereby, demonstrating the prominent role of their physicochemical characteristics (particle size and surface area) in pollutant adsorption and immobilization. The kinetic data was better fitted to pseudo-first order model, while Langmuir and Freundlich models seem to be best fit for nano-magnetites adsorption data rather than micromagnetite, where monolayer (Langmuir) was dominant. Electrostatic attraction and surface precipitation interaction via external mass transfer between bulk liquid to solid surface interface and surface functional groups (hydroxyl and carboxyl) were found as potential adsorption pathways rather than intraparticle diffusion. Experiments in single and binary metal contamination systems revealed competitive adsorption with affinity order of Pb > Cd. Thus, these findings demonstrate the effect of particle size and surface properties of a mineral in dictating the adsorption/desorption capacity, which has strong implications in understanding the fate and immobilization of metals in natural and engineered settings.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nZeeshan Ajmal: Data curation, Methodology, Investigation, Writing - original draft.

Present batch study evaluates the adsorption of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) onto three magnetites having nanometric (M1-30 nm and M2-60 nm) and micrometric particle sizes (M3-1.5 μm). Obtained data revealed that particle size of tested magnetites strongly affected the extent and kinetics of metal adsorption and desorption. Observed order of adsorption efficiency was M1 > M2 > M3 with optimum monolayer adsorption of 408.14, 331.40, 178.47 mg/g (for Pb) and 228.05, 170.86, 83.49 mg/g (for Cd), respectively. Adsorption data were well fitted to the Freundlich (R2 1⁄4 0.99), Langmuir (R2 1⁄4 0.99) and pseudo-first order models (R2 1⁄4 0.98). Electrostatic attraction and surface precipitation interaction via external mass transfer between bulk liquid-solid interfaces were the potential adsorption pathways. Pb showed higher affinity than Cd in multi-metal system. Desorption efficiency was higher in acidic environment (92%) than in distilled water (44%). Moreover, regenerated magnetite samples retained good adsorption capacity for six cycles. As soils are characterized by large variability of iron minerals, these findings have important implications regarding the transport and immobilization of contaminants particularly in the management of contaminated",
