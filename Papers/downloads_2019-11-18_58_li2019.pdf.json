Lately, there has been exciting progress in two different ways for desalination, namely, interfacial solar evaporation and film filtration. Graphene oxide based film is playing a critical role in both developments due to its high absorption, porous structure, high chemical stability, hydrophilicity, and excellent anti-fouling properties. In this works, we first introduce the mechanisms and key requirements for interfacial solar evaporation and filtration based desalination, and then explain how various forms of graphene oxide can be tailored for both types of desalination. Then, we summarize and discuss recent researches concerning both relevant technology advances and persisting problems, and finally provide a prospective view.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

      "text" : "Currently, about 4 billion people in the world suffer from severe water shortage for at least one month of each year [1]. About 97.5% of all water on the earth is seawater, therefore seawater desalination is regarded as one of most promising technologies to alleviate\nwater shortage. In the past few years, several technologies for desalination such as solar evaporation and filtration have progressed rapidly [2e4]. Graphene oxide (GO), among various forms of nanomaterials, provides tremendous opportunities for rational design and tailoring for solar evaporation and film filtration because of its high absorption, porous structure, high chemical stability, hydrophilicity, and excellent anti-fouling properties [3,4]. Nowadays, GO has widely been used as absorber in solar desalination and as filtration film in desalination.\nIn this review, we focus on the recent progress of GO based desalination. First, we discussed the mechanisms and key requirements for GO based interfacial solar evaporation and filtration, and further explained how various forms of GO can be tailored for both types of desalination. Then, we summarized the recent researches concerning both relevant technological advances. At the end, we presented current challenges and crucial issues of recent GO based desalination, aiming to provide a guideline for further development of GO based desalination."

      "text" : "As shown in Fig. 1a, during the interfacial solar evaporation, GO film can be an excellent absorber [5e23], taking in sunlight and converting it into thermal energy through optically excited electron-electron scattering, thus heating and evaporating water. The added benefit of GO films with nanochannels is that it provides a path for water supply and vapor escape. Desalination is therefore achieved by the phase-changing process, with the non-volatile ions left. Finally, fresh water is collected through condensation. This technology has several main features: (1) it is exclusively driven by solar energy; (2) it exhibits extremely high ion removal efficiency; (3) it requires low capital investment. All of these make this technology highly applicable as a portable device that can be used in developing countries and remote areas that lack infrastructure.\n2.2. GO based filtration film\nAs shown in Fig. 1b, GO nanosheets can be assembled as stacked GO films with 2D nanochannels between two adjacent GO nanosheets for desalination [24e51]. The d-spacing of nanochannels is about 0.76 nm (Dry GO, Note: this value can be tuned and will be discussed in more details later), which is larger than water molecules (0.275 nm) so as to enable the permeation of water. On the contrary, the ions (Liþ (0.764 nm), Naþ (0.716 nm), Kþ (0.662 nm), Mg2þ (0.856 nm), Ca2þ (0.824 nm), F (0. 704 nm), Cl (0.664 nm), Br (0.660 nm)) [52] can be separated from seawater through size exclusion and electrostatic interactions, thus achieving desalination via GO film filtration. There are several main features about\nthis technology: (1) it exhibits high water flux; (2) it requires relatively high capital investment; and (3) it requires electricity power to drive. All of these features determine that this technology is particularly suitable for centralized solution."

Note: the electrons can be excited under solar irradiation in carbon-based materials, and then the excited electrons are quickly relaxed and generate heat by electron-electron scattering. Then, the heat energy heats up the surface water, resulting in evaporation. Usually, the absorber's temperature is higher than the ambient temperature, so it also brings heat losses (Heat losses via conduction, convection and radiation).

Furthermore, the result also shows that the GO film has a porous structure, and that hydrophilicity is a suitable characteristic for absorbers in solar steam generation. Currently, some new GO based structures have been selected as absorbers like vertically aligned reduced GO (RGO) film (as shown in Fig. 3b and c) [7], 3D cross-linked polymer-like RGO material [8] (as shown in Fig. 3d) and RGO ball-based film [9] (as shown in Fig. 3e).

Based on this, some mixed absorbers, such as GO/carbon nanotubes [10], GO/cellulose esters [11], etc. have also been selected as absorbers and they have achieved high absorption (>97%) (as shown in Fig. 3f). The absorption of GO film can also be enhanced by improving the reduction degree and hydrophilic property of GO film [12,13]."

      "heading" : "3.2. Heat management",
      "text" : "As shown in equ. (1), apart from optical management, heat management (i.e. managing heat losses from conduction, convection and radiation) is also critical to highly efficient solar steam generation. GO films with low cross-plane thermal conductivity is beneficial for suppressing conduction loss. In order to further suppress conduction loss, various GO aerogel [14] and GO hybrid films [15,16] with low thermal conductivity have also been used. However, in application, even the low thermal conductivity of the GO based materials, water (which possesses a very high thermal conductivity ~ 0.6Wm 1 K 1) will fill the GO based materials due to their porous structure and hydrophilicity, resulting in high thermal conductivity for the whole system. As a result, a significant portion of the absorbed energy is lost to the bulk water. Therefore, high solar-to-steam conversion efficiency (~80%) are mostly achieved with the aid of insulation containers or optical concentration techniques. For example, Jiang et al. [15] reported a bilayered biofoam composed of bacterial nanocellulose and RGO for solar steam generation (as shown in Fig. 4a and b). Even the thermal conductivity of this material in dry state is about 0.069Wm 1 K 1 at room temperature, the thermal conductivity is increased to about\non microscope (SEM) (c) image of vertically aligned RGO film [7].

Therefore, ~83% solar-to-steam conversion efficiency can be achieved when the concentration techniques (10 kWm 2) are used.\nIn order to overcome this challenge, it has been proposed that confining water into a one-dimensional (1D) water path (it means the water supply is just through a columnar, which are confined in other two dimensions) and two-dimensional (2D) water path (it means the water supply is just through a thin layer, which are confined in the third dimension) can decouple the water supply and thermal conduction. For example, as shown in Fig. 4c Li et al. [6] demonstrated that a GO film is not in direct contact with bulk water, but it is in indirect contact with the bulk water through a 2D water path, which is enabled by a thin layer of hydrophilic cellulose that is wrapped over the surface of the polystyrene foam. Thewater supply is pumped to the absorber by capillary force through hydrophilic cellulose while the conduction heat loss is suppressed by the hydrophobic polystyrene foam (thermal conductivity is about 0.04Wm 1 K 1). Finally, 78% solar-to-steam conversion efficiency was achieved without any insulative container or optical concentration. Based on this strategy, higher efficiency (~83%) has been achieved through optimization of material structure and 2D water path [17].\nAfter fixing the conduction loss problem, some research has shifted focus to methods of reducing convective and radiative heat loss. Currently, one efficient strategy is to reduce the temperature of evaporation. As shown in equ. (1), the convection loss and radiation loss is minimized when the temperature difference between the absorber and the ambient temperature is reduced. Currently, Li et al. [5] reported that three-dimensional artificial transpiration devices comprised of GO films have been proposed as they can increase effective evaporation area (as shown in Fig. 4d). As a result, the evaporation temperature can be significantly decreased. With the addition of this technique, 85% solar-to-steam conversion efficiency has been achieved without insulative containers or optical concentration."

[12] reported the solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency can be increased by 15% through tuning the hydrophilic property of reduced GO film.\n3.4. Purification effects\nAs mentioned above, high salt rejection rate is an advantageous property for solar desalination. In general, this technology can decrease the salinity of seawater by 3e4 orders of magnitude below the values obtained through film-based seawater desalination (10e500mg L 1) aswell as the standard (200mg L 1) establishedby the World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, some works reported that the purification is almost completely independent on pH value, salt concentration and ion species due to high chemical stability of GO based materials [5,8]. For example, Li et al. [5] has designed a GO based absorber for interfacial solar desalination. The result shown that the collected water from the condensed vapor is pure enough to meet WHO drinking water standards, even though the different ion species, such as Cu2þ, Cd2þ, Pb2þ and Zn2þ, were used. Meanwhile, they also demonstrated the purification effect is almost the same at different pH conditions (pH¼ 2, 4 and 7)."

Furthermore, the GO leaf can be easily restored to its pristine performance by simply scraping off salt crystals from GO film surface and rinsing with water."

      "text" : "As mentioned, GO multi-layer films with aforementioned properties are favorable candidates for next-generation desalination films. Salt rejection and water flux are the main figure of merit. Unfortunately, there is almost always a trade-off between the two. However, this trade-off can be broken using intercalation, changing deposition method of GO film or utilizing electrostatic interaction between GO and ions. The salt rejection rate can be calculated by the feed and permeate concentrations using Eq. (3) as shown below [24,25]:\nRð%Þ ¼ ðCf CpÞ = Cf 100% (3)\nwhere R is the salt retention rate, and Cf and Cp are the feed and salt permeate concentrations (ppm). The permeation rate can be calculated at a certain pressure using Eq. (4) as shown below:\nWater flux ¼ Q = ðA DtÞ (4)\nwhere Q is the permeate quantity (L), A is the area of film (m2), and Dt is the processing time.\n4.1. Tuning of salt rejection rate and water flux of GO film\n4.1.1. Intercalation of GO film for tuning salt rejection rate and water flux\nIntercalation is an effective way to tune the salt rejection rate\nand water flux. Polymer intercalation is a frequently used strategy for tuning the salt rejection rate and water flux. So far, N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N, N0-methylene-bisacrylamide (0.48 nm) [26], polydopamine (0.345 nm) [27], 1, 4-phenylene diisocyanate [25], polyimide hollow fiber [28], 1, 4-cyclohyxanediamine and pphenylenediamine (pPDA) (0.56 nm) [29] have all been selected as intercalated materials. For example, the chemical reduction of GO (RGO) laminates and a hydrophilic adhesive polydopamine layer were applied. RGO laminates sustainably retained their compacted nanochannels (0.345 nm) compared to pristine GO laminates, which increased the selectivity of hydrated ions. Moreover, the water absorption speed can be accelerated via improving the hydrophilicity of the RGO laminate surface by adding a polydopamine coating onto the RGO laminates. As a result of these synergistic effects, these hybrid films achieved an outstanding water flux of 36.6 Lm 2 h 1, and a high salt rejection rate of 92.0% [27].\nIntercalation of other 2D materials (such as a few layers of graphene [30], monolayer titania [31], etc) is also usually helpful for tuning the salt rejection rate and water flux. For example, by intercalating monolayer titania (TO) nanosheets into GO film with mild ultraviolet reduction, the hybrid RGO/TO film showed excellent desalination performance. The result showed that the salt rejection rate can reach as high as 95% and water transfilm permeation can be retained at about 60%. Here, the decrease of dspacing caused by photoreduction of the GO by TO under mild ultraviolet irradiation gave rise to the high salt rejection rate. The photoinduced hydrophilic transformation of the TO nanosheets within the GO film resulted in the preservation of the relatively\nhigh water flux [30]. Ion intercalation is also an effective way to tune the d-spacing of GO films. Chen et al. [32] found that some cationic ions such as Kþ, Naþ, Ca2þ, Liþ or Mg2þ ions can tune the d-spacing of GO films with ångstr€om precision. Moreover, GO films (as shown in Fig. 6a and b) can effectively reject other cations with larger hydrated volume when the GO filmwas inserted by a certain type of cation (as shown in Fig. 6c and d). The result showed that untreated GO films demonstrated Naþ, Mg2þ and Ca2þ permeation rates of 0.190molm 2 h 1, 0.025molm 2 h 1 and 0.019molm 2 h 1, respectively. For comparison, KCl-treated GO films showed the permeation rates of Naþ, Mg2þ and Ca2þ were below that of the cation detection limits. At the same time, the water flux of KCltreated GO films can reach 0.36 Lm 2 h 1. The foundational mechanism revealed by first-principles calculations and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy is that the location of the most stable cation adsorption is in functional groups and aromatic rings. Also, other cations such as Fe2þ, Co2þ, Cu2þ, Cd2þ, Cr2þ and Pb2þ are expected to be able to tune the d-spacing of GO films because they have much stronger interactions with graphene than Naþ. Apart from d-space tuning, Aaron et al. [30] demonstrated that the Ca2þ ion interaction with GO films (at present of deoxycholate) can improve salt rejection rates because these compounds of Ca2þ and deoxycholate confer zwitterionic behaviour to GO films.\n4.1.2. Modification of GO film for tuning salt rejection rate and water flux\nApart from intercalation strategy, the preparation of GO film can also efficiently tune the salt rejection rate and water flux. Lately, Xu et al. [33] demonstrated that the ion selectivity and water flux can\nbe synergetically regulated by controlling the deposition rate. The results showed that the GO films obtained by slow deposition not only can improve salt rejection rate, but also can obtain 2.5e4 times higher water flux than fast deposition. This is because the slow assembly contains both an oxidized surface facing another oxidized surface (O O) and a pristine surface facing another pristine surface (P P) subdomains and the fast assembly contains only an oxidized surface facing a pristine surface (O P) subdomains (as shown in Fig. 7a). The simulation study showed that the water transport in nanochannels with the O O and O P subdomains is slower than hydrophobic nanochannels with the P P subdomains. The corresponding water flux and salt rejection can be found in Fig. 7b and c. This exciting finding provides a new approach for synergetic regulation of ion selectivity and water flux. However, the method's reliability and molecular-sieving preciseness still need to be further explored.\nPreparation of the nanochannels is also an efficient way to tune salt rejection rate and water flux. Huang et al. [34] reported an ultrafiltration nanostrand-channelled GO (NSC-GO) film with numerous nanochannels with diameters ranging from 3 to 5 nm. These films were prepared via the deposition of a mixed solution of copper hydroxide nanostrands and GO sheets onto a porous support, followed by hydrazine reduction, and finalized by removing the copper hydroxide nanostrands. Without compromising the salt rejection rate, this technique resulted in a water flux of 695± 20 Lm 2 h 1 bar 1, 10x higher than untreated GO film and 100x higher than commercial ultrafiltration films with a similar salt rejection rate. The salt rejection rate of all the negatively charged molecules is dominated by themolecular-sieving mechanismwhile the high water flux can be attributed to both significantly enhanced\nween the GO sheets depict the fixation of interlayer spacing by hydrated Kþ.

(A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)\nporosity and decreased channel length of several micrometres in the NSC- GO film.\nSome techniques based on the modification of GO films have been selected to tune salt rejection rate and water flux. For example, Han et al. [35] demonstrated around a 20e60% salt rejection rate at 21.8 Lm 2 h 1 bar 1 by tuning a functional group of GO and utilizing electrostatic interactions. Recently, Hong et al. [36] demonstrated that ion rejection in GO filmswere influenced by the nanochannel's surface charge. These surface charges enabled the GO films to achieve a 96% salt rejection rate. Therefore, increasing the film's surface charge can also improve the salt rejection rate in GO films without sacrificing the water flux."

      "text" : "Encapsulation is another efficient method to tune the d-spacing of GO films. Abraham et al. [37] recently discovered an effectiveway of controlling the d-spacing in GO films in the sub nanometer range. The GO films with desirable d-spacing were encapsulated and stacked together using stycast epoxy, which added energy barriers for swelling while also enabling accurate and tunable ion sieving capabilities. This method resulted in a salt rejection rate of 97% for NaCl with a water flux of about 0.5 Lm 2 h 1.\n4.2. Tuning of stability of GO film\nThe d-spacing in GO films is the critical parameter that determines the desalination property. Swelling of GO film always increases the d-spacing of GO films. Recently, Zheng et al. [38] reported the max d-spacing of GO film in water can reach as long as 6e7 nm at equilibrium after swelling. The oxygenated functional groups in the GO makes it very hydrophilic, resulting in a tendency\nfor the materials to absorb water and swell. There are some strategies (such as reduction, mixing with polyer, encapsulation, etc) to resolve this issue. For example, Abraham et al. [37] showed that it is possible to mitigate the swelling of GO film in water simply by incorporating graphene plates into GO film. The composites referring as GOegraphene film exhibit notably less swelling (difference in d-spacing of z4 Å) as compared to standard GO film. The observed huge difference in d-spacing between GO film and GOgraphene film can be attributed to graphene's hydrophobicity that limits the water intake. Although some techniques can help mitigate the swelling, the effectiveness of these techniques in longtime cycle or prolonged use need to be further researched.\n“One thing that need more attention is the symmetry of GO film [3]. Tang et al. [39] found that the chemical structure of reduced GO film out of the vacuum-filtrated method is asymmetric, which should be carefully considered for applications of desalination. ”"

      "text" : "In summary, GO with high absorption, porous structure, high chemical stability, hydrophilicity, and excellent anti-fouling properties has been proved to be a promising material for desalination through interfacial solar evaporation and filtration. Currently, although some progress has been made, there are still a few key issues upon which we lack adequate understanding.\nFor interfacial solar evaporation based approach, (1) it is necessary to further explore the influence of intrinsic properties of GO film on the process of solar evaporation and desalination. (2) Salt precipitation tends to destroy thewater path ormicro structure of GO film that causes the decrease of efficiency. Therefore, salt rejection is a very important issue to solar desalination. Even\nthough some researchers have achieved NaCl rejection through concentrated diffusion, the complete rejection of ions like Ca2þ and Mg2þ has yet to be accomplished because their concentrations approach saturation in seawater; (3) More work need to be done to explore the stability of GO film so as to accelerate the application of GO film; For filtration based approach, (1) it is critical to probe fundamentally how the intrinsic properties of GO can influence the filtration process; (2) the swelling of GO film in water has an adverse effect on the rejection of salt and thus it is crucial we learn to better mitigate it for desalination; (3) reaching an 100% salt rejection rate is a tough task for GO films. While the methods discovered until today have achieved unprecedented effect, it is important that the scientific community continues searching new strategies to achieve a higher salt rejection rate and larger water flux by improving the designs of functional group and micro structure of GO films."

Lately, there has been exciting progress in two different ways for desalination, namely, interfacial solar evaporation and film filtration. Graphene oxide based film is playing a critical role in both developments due to its high absorption, porous structure, high chemical stability, hydrophilicity, and excellent anti-fouling properties. In this works, we first introduce the mechanisms and key requirements for interfacial solar evaporation and filtration based desalination, and then explain how various forms of graphene oxide can be tailored for both types of desalination. Then, we summarize and discuss recent researches concerning both relevant technology advances and persisting problems, and finally provide a prospective view. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
