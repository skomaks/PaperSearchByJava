      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Following its first discovery in 1980, alginate-based microencapsulation particles have extensively studied for developing nanomaterials and other functional materials [1, 2]. Hydrogelling ability of alginates has expanded its uses and research perspectives in biomedicine and multiple disciplines, including the food industry, sewage treatment, and as an adsorptive material for heavy metal removal from contaminated water [3-5]. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are extensively explored, targeting their potential biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Chemical structures of biopolymers closely resemble macromolecules of the native extracellular environment. Hence, the majority of biopolymers are compatible with living systems compared to synthetic polymers [6]. Alginate polymers are biodegradable, biocompatible mucoadhesive, hemocompatible and have not been found to accumulate in biological systems [7]. Thus, alginates could be utilized in multiple applications due to its inert nature. With the rapid advancements in nanotechnology, many inorganic and organic nonmaterial are synthesized through the control of matter and investigated for desirable functional properties [8]. Currently, a vast number of nanomaterials are available with different sizes, shapes, textures, and compositions. Alginate-based nanomaterials have become one of the major interests in modern-day scientific research. Different types of alginate-based nanomaterials with different sizes, shapes, and compositions have now been synthesized [9-11]. They are particularly attractive for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications as well as for food packaging and environmental remediation. Among the wide range of techniques used in fabricating nanomaterials, controlled gelification by Ca2+ ions, ionotropic gelation with positively charged polymers, electrospinning, self-assembly of structurally modified alginate into nanoaggregates, thermally-induced phase separation, and microfluidics are extensively studied for alginatebased nanomaterials. Fabricating different types of nanoparticles and nanofibers using\n4 biopolymers especially for biomedical applications, is a challenging process, which involves maintaining stability and biocompatibility. Considering food packaging and environmental remediation, some of the currently used materials are undesirable considering their nondegradable nature, which creates environmental issues. Alginate is an environmentally friendly component that can be recycled and undergo degradation. Alginate nanomaterials is a broadly and rapidly developing field targeting both industries and academia. The use of alginate-based nanomaterial in specific biomedical and other applications has extensively been reviewed with respect to its physicochemical properties [12-14]. Production techniques of alginate gel particles have also been reviewed [2, 15]. The present review attempts to provide an overall view of the current state of knowledge and how the physicochemical properties of alginate-based nanomaterials would associate with its wide-ranging uses in different applications. It is our sincere hope that this will provide an insight to further advancement of the field of biomaterials engineering."

      "text" : "Alginates are naturally occurring anionic, chain-forming, hydrophilic, colloidal heteropolysaccharides with randomly arranged linear unbranched chains of α-l-guluronate (G block) and β-d-mannuronate (M block) residues which are C5-epimers. The arrangement of G and M blocks in alginates could be consecutive (repeating units of GGGG or MMMM blocks), alternating (GMGMGMGM) or random depending on their natural source [4, 16]. The unperturbed dimensions of the polymer chains increase based on the order of their monomeric substitution pattern (MG-blocks < MM-blocks < GG-blocks). Alginates contain many free hydroxyls (−OH) and carboxyl (−COOH) groups enabling them to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. FTIR studies of alginic acid clearly explain these molecular features [17]. Alginates from seaweeds occasionally contain attached sulfate groups whereas,\n5 alginates found in some bacteria such as Azotobacter vinelandii contain acetyl groups [18]. Physicochemical characteristics of alginate much depend on the monomeric composition sequence, molecular weight, and attached functional groups. These features could vary depending on their natural source, location in the plant, and varies based on geographical location and season. The crystal structure of alginate fibers prepared from Fucus vesiculosus has been recorded as an orthorhombic unit cell structure with 7.6 Å, 10.4 Å (fiber axis), and 8.6 Å for a two disaccharide chain unit cell with space group P212121 [17]. However, X-ray diffraction patterns could vary depending on the monomer composition and attachment pattern in alginic acid samples."

      "heading" : "1.2. Sources of alginates, extraction, and purification methods",
      "text" : "Alginate is a renowned polysaccharide, a component of the cell walls of brown algae and an exopolysaccharide of some bacteria (Pseudomonas and Azotobacter) [18]. Commercially alginate is produced using Laminaria hyperborea, Laminaria digitata, Macrocystis pyrifera, Ascophyllum nodosum, Eclonia maxima, Laminaria japonica, Lessonia nigrescens, Durvillea antarctica, and Sargassum spp. [19, 20]. Alginate chains are composed of mannuronic and guluronic acid units whose pK values are published as 3.38 and 3.65, respectively. Alginic acid forms a precipitate generally below pH 3.6 at ambient temperature [10]. Hence alginates are purified from the powdered brown algae under alkaline extraction conditions using sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or gelatinous aluminum hydroxide (above pH 6.0). Subsequently, alginates are precipitated out from the filtrate by techniques such as acidification, the addition of Ca2+ ions (forms calcium alginate), or by adding ethanol (lowering dielectric constant) [21, 22]. Depigmentation of algae powder prior extraction is essential to reduce brown discoloration of the final product. Another impurity, which alters the purity and rheological properties of alginate is polyphenols. Phenolic compounds form\n6 strong dipolar forces with polysaccharides [23]. Hence, algae powder after depigmentation is soaked in formaldehyde or formaldehyde in ethanol to facilitate formaldehyde crosslinking of phenolic compounds, making them insoluble in the extraction solvent [21, 22]. Fluorescence spectroscopy at an emission wavelength of 450 nm could be generally used to estimate the polyphenolic levels in the final product isolated during the extraction process [24]. Diluted acid pretreatment before the alkaline extraction seems to increase the yield of alginate and reduce phenolic content. Diluted mineral acids could convert calcium alginate into alginic acid which could increase the extraction efficiency with alkali than using the original calcium alginate [22]. Further, it has shown to remove any soluble phenolic compound after the formalin treatment [25]."

Below we have discussed a few of the prominent methods adapted in formulating alginate-based nanomaterials. Fig. 1 illustrate the principles behind each method, which are profoundly explained in upcoming subsections. According to many publications, low molecular weight and partially oxidized alginates without significant alteration to its basic alginate structure have shown better degradation and clearance from the body compared to native alginate, which has a prolonged degradation rate that causes difficulties being cleared off from the body [26]. Our previous review discloses a comprehensive description of favorable reaction conditions for functionalizing alginate helpful in clarifying some of the reaction schemes mentioned herewith [27].\n7"

      "heading" : "2.1. Controlled gelification using Ca2+ ions.",
      "text" : "Alginates being anionic polymers with carboxylate groups, readily form gels in the presence of calcium ions and other divalent cations (Fig. 1, A). The ionic and coordination crosslinking between alginate and divalent cations proceed favored by the interactions between G blocks and the cations. Thus, alginates with a high guluronate content could yield stronger gels. The famous “Egg box” model initially described by Grant et al. [1973] explains the structure of the junction zones in calcium alginate hydrogels (Fig. 2). The formation of calcium-alginate nanocomposites should be done under controlled conditions. Many studies regarding calcium-alginate nanocomposites rely on the functionalization of the composites by encapsulating different materials such as metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, drugs, or bioanalytical markers. Motshekga et al. [2018] describe the synthesis of Bentonite supported ZnO nanoparticle (20–90 nm) encapsulated alginate nanocomposites via Ca2+ mediated controlled gelification process. The encapsulation technique follows the incorporation of an alginate solution containing a homogeneous dispersion of Bentonite supported ZnO nanoparticles to a solution of Ca2+. The continuous stirring of the gelation medium (Ca2+ solution) ensures uninterrupted bead formation while preventing bead aggregation. Moreover, the dispersion of the nanoparticles on the Bent support reduces their agglomeration. Another approach of fabricating nanoshell carrier (250 nm) is the encapsulation of drug-loaded nanoparticles in calcium alginate nano hydrogel shell by water-in-oil microemulsion templates [30]. Herein the core, gold nanorods (50 nm) conjugated porous silicon nanoparticles, and drugs are encapsulated in calcium alginate hydroshells by mixing a nanoemulsion of alginate, core nanoparticles and AOT-isooctane with a nanoemulsion of diluted CaCl2 and AOT-isooctane at 25 °C. This method could be optimized for achieving a higher encapsulation efficiency with a high loading capacity while having a low cellular toxicity. Photothermal sensitivity to local temperature increase is desirability for the\n8 controllable release of therapeutics by near-infrared laser photothermal therapy. In relation to other nanomaterial fabrication methods mentioned herewith, controlled gelification using Ca2+ ions is the simplest method, which could be easily implemented. The stability of the Intra/inter-molecular crosslinking resulting particles is comparatively higher due to the strong crosslinking with Ca2+ ions."

      "heading" : "2.2. Formation of polyionic complexes through ionotropic gelation via intermolecular",
      "text" : "interactions Alginates being an anionic polymer, has widely investigated for the production of nanocomposites by ionotropic gelation with positively charged polymers (Fig. 1, B). Among the various types of alginate-polycation complexes reported in the literature, chitosanalginate polyion nanocomplexes are considered to be of higher interest. Chitosan-alginate complexes are synthesized through the ionic crosslinking between positively charged amino groups of chitosan (pKa = 6.2-7) with negatively charged carboxylate groups of alginic acid [31]. The complex formation should be done under carefully monitored conditions using low concentration solutions of either species. Several studies investigate the efficacy of chitosan/alginate nanoparticles to encapsulate curcumin derivatives such as curcumin diethyl diglutarate [32] and curcumin diglutaric acid by water-in-oil emulsification (~215 nm) and ionotropic gelification (226 ± 23 - 334 ± 12 nm) [33]. Herein the drug is fist dispersed in alginate solution containing Pluronic®F-127 with continuous stirring and sonication to achieve the emulsification. Then a CaCl2 solution is dropwise added to obtain an emulsion with the pre-gel property (ionic and coordination crosslinking). The resulting emulsion adjusted to pH 4.9 is then combined with chitosan solutions adjusted to pH 4.6 at different dose ratios to optimize the conditions for obtaining the nanoparticles (ionotropic gelation). A recent study describes curcumin loaded layer-by-layer assembly of chitosan and sodium alginate platforms (~200 nm) around citrate coated MnFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles (~12 nm)\n9 [34]. Herein the MnFe2O4 nanoparticles have been synthesized by a thermal decomposition method followed by initial capping with citrate. Layering has been done under monitored conditions at room temperature to prevent the overwhelming complexation of chitosan and alginate in bulk. Following subsequent depositions, the nanoparticles precipitate had decanted magnetically, suspended in ultrapure water, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove excess biopolymers in the supernatant. After each washing, the pH of all the solutions has been readjusted to ~5 prior to the next biopolymer assembly.\nThe preparation of a nontoxic, reduced drug-releasing insulin coated alginate-C18 conjugates nanoparticles encapsulated chitosan-oleic acid beads (522.50 ± 66.47 nm) have been described by Alfatama et al. [2018]. Herein alginate-C18 conjugates are prepared by reacting tetrabutylammonium alginate with 1-bromoctadecane followed by the addition of a sodium chloride aqueous solution. This follows the dropwise addition of insulin with continuous stirring. These insulin coated alginate-C18 conjugate nanoparticles in solution adjusted to pH 4-4.5 are then processed into beads by extruding through an encapsulator integrated with a vibrating nozzle to a continuously stirred solution of calcium acetate at 25°C. Beads are then coated by simultaneously extruding the bead solution containing sodium tripolyphosphate with a chitosan-oleic acid conjugate solution adjusted to pH 5.5, which enables the coacervation of the chitosan and alginate. Further consolidation and coating were promoted with crosslinking of chitosan with tripolyphosphate ions and reaction of alginate with calcium ions.\nOther than chitosan, cationic polymers such as poly-L-lysine (pKa = 9-10.5) and Eudragit E100 (pKa = 7.0–7.3) have been used with alginate to form polyionic complexes [10]. Antigen (BSA) encapsulated ε-polylysine-sodium alginate nanoparticles (133.2 ± 0.5 nm) have been self-assembled by ionotropic complexation. Here the ionic interaction forms between positively charged -NH3+groups of ε-polylysine and negatively charged –COO- of\n10\nalginate at a pH of 7.4 [36]. The conjugation of targeting ligands (monoclonal antibodies, peptides, or small molecules) to the surface of alginate nanoparticles allows the active targeting of these drugs encapsulated nanomaterial to be accumulated in the tissues of interest [37]. Zimet et al. [2018] describe a modified two-step method of fabricating Nisaplin loaded nanoparticles (60–70 nm). Initially, a pre-gel of alginate is prepared at pH 5.2 by adding a minor amount of Ca2+ to the alginate solution, which contains Nisaplin. Successively it is cross-linked with poly-l-lysine and chitosan at 25°C.\nFormulation of rifampicin loaded alginate/cellulose nanocrystals (55 ± 20 nm) by the ionotropic gelation technique has been studied by [39]. Cellulose nanocrystals possess excellent compaction properties, which makes it an ideal carrier of pharmaceuticals. Herein, cellulose nanocrystals have been dispersed in a solution of alginate containing natural honey, which acts as the capping and stabilizing agent. A solution of Ca2+ is then incorporated into the above medium with continuous agitation. Cellulose nanocrystals are described to enhance mechanical stability while being a stable drug carrier with a high loading efficiency [40].\nA zein/caseinate/alginate nanoparticle (208 nm) fabrication method has been described by [41]. Zein is a prolamine protein with hydrophobic characteristics. Zein-based nanoparticles are increasingly studied for drug delivery applications due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and slower digestibility. It is reported as an ideal carrier for lipophilic bioactives. A well-blended alkaline solution containing deprotonated propolis, zein (dissolved in ethanol), sodium caseinate micelles, and alginate is gradually acidified by adding citrate buffer (pH 3.8), which results in the formation of composite nanoparticles. The acidification increases the electrostatic complexation improving the aggregation of zein, caseinate, and alginate.\n11\nA novel study describes the synthesis of aggregation-induced emission active polymeric nanoparticles (226 ± 63.3 nm) by conjugating oxidized sodium alginate with aggregationinduced emission (AIE)-active dye, 2-(4-aminophenyl)-3-(10-hexadecyl-4H-phenothiazin-3yl)acrylonitrile (PhE-NH2) using pyruvic acid as the molecular “bridge” by microwaveassisted Döbner reaction [42]. Oxidized alginate has been added to a solution of phenothiazine and pyruvic acid, which is dissolved in DMSO. The mixture is then reacted in a microwave reactor at 120 °C. The dropwise addition of acetone precipitates the product nanoparticles. The synthesis of AIE-active carbohydrate polymers remains challengeable due to the reduced solubility of carbohydrates in organic solvents. However, the described reaction scheme provides a successful approach to develop fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles in a fast, cost-effective manner under mild reaction conditions. Polyionic complexation is a relatively complex fabrication method which should be carried out under controlled conditions. However, it allows the incorporation of different properties which is useful for different applications."

      "text" : "Spray drying is a widely used technique of nano/microencapsulation of therapeutics to alter pharmacokinetics while improving stability. The method involves the atomization of a liquid slurry and rapid drying by a gas (Fig. 1, C). Spray drying at sub-ambient temperatures (Spray freeze-drying) is suitable for thermo-sensitive compounds [43]. Drug loaded nanoparticles generated via spray drying are coated by crosslinking with a suitable ion or by polyionic complexation. In one study, caffeine-loaded peptides (pepsin hydrolysate of whey proteins) nanoparticles (100 - 300 nm) fabricated via emulsification in ethanol and vacuum, drying is homogeneously dispersed in the sodium alginate and spray dried obtaining microparticles (4 μm). These are then dispersed in a CaCl2 aqueous solution to cross-link microparticles. Crosslinked particles are separated by centrifugation [44]. Erdinc and Neufeld [2011]\n12\ndescribe the preparation of Protein (subtilisin) nanoencapsulates (2.2 to 4.5 µm) by spray drying a solution of protein loaded alginate, which is set to a pre gelling state by incorporating glycol-chitosan or Ca2+. The volume reduction during spray drying stiffens the partially cross-linked pre-gelled nanoparticles. Regulation of feeding rate of sample, feed spraying pressure, air pressure, aspirator speed, temperature of drying gas and dryer chamber controls the particle size."

      "heading" : "2.4. Alginate nanoaggregates through self-assembly",
      "text" : "This method does not utilize Ca2+ induced gelification or cationic polymers to form the aggregates. The methodology includes self-assembly of polymeric material through intra/inter-molecular crosslinking with other polymers or compounds. Chang et al. [2012] describe the synthesis of disulfide cross-linked nanospheres (170 nm) by a sodium alginate derivative. Herein sodium alginate is first oxidized with periodate at room temperature, which is then thiolated with 4-aminothiophenol at room temperature forming amphiphilic molecules that undergo self-assembly into reverse micelles. These undergo disulfide bond cross-linking and subsequent air oxidation following ultrasonication (Fig. 3). Hollow nanospheres (487- 974 nm) have been fabricated via self-assembly of alginate-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) and αcyclodextrin in aqueous solution [47]. Here, the bonding of poly(ethylene glycol) oligomers on the alginate backbone construct a rigid-coil system, which is then mixed in α-cyclodextrin, a complexing agent that increases aqueous solubility resulting in the formation of inclusion molecules that self-assemble into hollow spheres. Stable micelles (50–300 nm) by selfassembly of amphiphilic alginate graft copolymers have been prepared by single electron transfer-living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) [48]. Here tetrabutylammonium salt of low molecular weight fragments of native alginate is esterified with bromoisobutyric acid by activating alginate hydroxyl groups with carbonyldiimidazole followed by methyl methacrylate grafting. The self-assembled product undergoes radical polymerization in the\n13\npresence of Cu(0) and Tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine as the catalyst. Above micelles with outer-shell containing alginate with preserved carboxylate moieties could have significant potential in targeted and controlled delivery of drugs. Intra/inter-molecular crosslinking reactions in the above approaches are carried out under controlled reaction conditions to prevent any undesirable degradation."

      "text" : "electrospinning and electrospraying Electrohydrodynamic methods, namely electrospinning and electrospraying, respectively allow the fabrication of fibrous membranes and particles at micron, submicron, and nanoscale levels (Fig. 1, D). Fibrous membranes obtained by electrospinning are having a high surface area to volume ratio with interconnected pore structure properties, which are desirable for cellular attachment, proliferation, and migration. The electrospinning technique uses an electric field to generate nanofibers from a charged polymeric solution. A jet of polymeric material is sprayed on a surface driven by the application of an electrical potential between a capillary needle and the surface. Electrospun jet undergoes extensive stretching and rapid drying with the evaporation of the solvent. This process leads to the deposition of a porous non-intertwined 3D network of nanofibrils. Based on the disable properties of the nanofibrous mesh, it could mimic the natural extracellular matrix of animal tissues [49]. Electrospun alginate fiber membranes cannot be fabricated in aqueous solutions by only itself due to the low breaking strength of the fibers and brittleness which limits its applications [50]. Hence non-toxic synthetic polymers are used in combination to obtain nanofibers possessing better mechanical properties and thermal stability. Chae et al. [2013] describe an approach to fabricate hydroxyapatite/alginate-based nanocomposite fibrous scaffolds (average diameter of 141 ± 45 nm) for bone tissue regeneration using the electrospinning technique. A mixture of\n14\nsodium alginate, polyethylene oxide, and Triton X-100 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide have been used to cast the nanocomposite fibers. Sodium phosphate has been used as the precursor ions for the in situ synthesis of hydroxyapatite. The electrospun nanofibers collected at the rotating grounded drum is stirred in a calcium nitrate solution for forming hydroxyapatite, while it assists to crosslink alginate. Udaseen et al. [2014] describe the fabrication of nanofibrous scaffolds (diameter range 100 nm - 1000 nm) through a nozzle (needle) free electrospinning of a blend of polyvinyl alcohol and alginate. Herein, Nozzle-free electrospinning, compared to needle-based electrospinning techniques, enables the rapid production of nanofibrous mats. The formation of hydrogen bonds between polyvinyl alcohol and alginate supposedly improves the thermal stability and mechanical properties of electrospun fiber membranes. Based on novel findings, the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles such as Nano-hydroxyapatite during the fabrication is found to improve mechanical stability, cell adhesion, and proliferation [50]. Further, it stabilizes the electrospun solution preventing agglomeration and precipitation of suspended components in the aqueous spinning solution. Hu et al. [2018] use polycaprolactone and alginate coelectrospinning using a dual-jet system for fabricating composite nanofibers (691 ± 116 nm) for in situ transfection applications. Polycaprolactone is a biocompatible polymer that can improve cell adhesion. Here DNA is first incorporated with polyethyleneimine, which condenses DNA into positively charged particles, facilitating ionic crosslinking with the alginate matrix. Electrospun nanofibers are immersed in absolute ethanol containing 2% CaCl2 to promote the crosslinking of alginate fibers.\nIn contrast, electrospraying is a liquid atomization process induced by electrical forces. The difference between the two techniques electrospinning and electrospraying relies on the concentration of the polymer solution. The formation of a Taylor cone could be observed with a high solution concentration, which results in polymer elongation due to whipping\n15\ninstability, which results in the fiber formation. With a low solution concentration, fine droplets are formed due to the instability of the jet. Consequently, self-dispersing of these highly charged droplets cause particle formation. Moreover, it prevents droplet agglomeration and coagulation [54]. Further, the solvent evaporation cause droplet contraction and solidification giving solid polymeric particles in the grounded collector. Coaxial electrospinning is another recent advancement, whereas the electrospraying setup contains a dual nozzle spinneret with an inner and outer capillary respectively for core and wall material of the fabricated articles. A cost-effective fabrication method for paclitaxel loaded sodium alginate-Ca2+/egg white nanoparticles (200 ± 18 nm) using an electronic spray method is described by [55]. Here the alginate and paclitaxel formulated liquid are electrosprayed to a grounded beaker containing egg white and calcium chloride solution under a voltage of 15.0 kV. Qiusheng et al. [2015] describe the fabrication of porous calcium alginate beads (1.969 mm) by electrospraying CaCl2 solution to an air perforated blend of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, CaCO3, and NaHCO3. They are then soaked in Zr(NO3)4 to facilitate the partial exchange of Ca2+ ions with Zr4+ producing zirconium alginate. Electrospray particles are seen as ideal nanoscaled drug delivery vehicles due to improved drug loading, controlled/sustainable drug-releasing capabilities over a long period, and the ability to aggregate at target locations [55]. Such biomaterials could have potential applications in tissue regeneration, tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, and wound dressings [50]."

As summarized in Fig. 1, E, this technique utilizes a low\n16\nmelting point, miscible, and hygroscopic solvent that could dissolve the polymer of interest. The phase separation is achieved with the addition of water followed by rapid mixing to obtain an emulsion. The emulsion is then cast into a mold and rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen. Then it is freeze-dried to obtain the porous scaffolds [57]. As Zhang, Liu, Yang and Zhu [2015] describe, silk fibroin/sodium alginate composite nanofibrous scaffolds (diameter 50–500 nm) prepared through the TIPS method could be used as a promising extracellular matrix for tissue engineering. According to the procedure, a mixture containing degummed and regenerated silk fibroin solution and sodium alginate solution have blended at 60°C and homogeneously mixed with a dioxane/water mixture to obtain the emulsion. After casting, the emulsion has been frozen at -80°C and freeze-dried for 24 hours. Thermally-induced phase separation (TIPS) is a promising technique for fabricating 3D nanofibrous scaffolds."

Fig. 1, F illustrate typical examples of microfluidics flow systems. Huang et al. [2006] describe a process of devising relatively uniform Na-alginate microdroplets (200 µm) in oil using a microfluidic chip, which in turn gelatinized by colliding with a Ca2+ rich phase. Although this method offer convenience over the other described methods, extremely sensitive instrumentalization is required. At present, uniform alginate nanoparticles of sizes ranging from 10 to 300 nm have been fabricated using this method [58]. The particle size could explicitly be controlled by controlling the physical parameters and chemical composition. In a much recent study, Kim et al. [2015] describe the generation of alginate-based nanoparticles (380-520 nm) by mixing Ca-alginate pre-gel solution with poly-L-lysine in a microfluidic mixing device. These nanoparticles have shown enhanced stability against aggregation with control over the\n17\nparticle size by controlling the flow rates. The synthesis of Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid /MgO-alginate core-shell microspheres has been described by Lin et al. [2018] using an oil/water emulsion approach. A specially designed microfluidic capillary device with coaxially aligned injection and collection capillaries within a square capillary has been used to produce poly lactic-co-glycolic acid /MgO-alginate core-shell droplets. Much of the previous processes described the formation of polydispersed nanoparticles without proper control over the partial size and homogenous nature. Since they could limit their use in biomedical applications. In contrast, with the developments in microfabrication and microreaction technologies and novel microfluidic devices, the ability to produce monodisperse water droplets in oil have modernized the fabrication of monodisperse polymer-based nanoparticles."

The occurrences of such phenomena depend upon the finite size and the surface properties that control the magnetic behavior of individual nanoparticles [62]. In this regard, magnetic alginate nanoparticles could offer additional benefits over the nonmagnetic alginate nanomaterial. The magnetic property is simply achieved by incorporating ferri and ferromagnetic material such as Fe3O4 (magnetite), Fe2O3 (maghemite), MnFe2O4 (jacobsite), SrFe12O19, Fe-C and alloys such as SmCo5 during the fabrication process [62, 63].

[2008] describe the synthesis of sodium alginate assisted iron oxide nanoparticles (~24.5 nm) with ferromagnetic properties via a redox-based hydrothermal process using urea and FeCl3•6H2O. During the synthesis, sodium alginate has found to play a dual role in stabilizing and reducing the material. The two major functional groups carboxylate (COO-) and\n18\nhydroxyl (-OH) are found to provide coordination sites to Fe3+ forming complexes. A recent study describes the fabrication of a pH-sensitive alginate/ maghemite magnetic nanoparticles (~7.7 nm) by a Green synthesis method and its adsorption properties on the cationic dye methylene blue [65]. Maghemite obtained by oxidation of magnetite is dispersed in water, obtaining a stable magnetic fluid (ferrofluid). Next, alginate solution is gradually introduced to it obtaining alginate-bound maghemite nanoparticles. The use of maghemite instead of magnetite is of particular interest as the magnetic core is much stable in this phase. Alginate nanomaterials with magnetic properties have revolutionized the methods of drug delivery due to the magnet induced drug release capabilities. Moreover, they are known to create a localized heat effect upon exposure to an altering magnetic field that could be used in hyperthermia treatment. In water remediation, they can be easily removed from treated wastewater [66]."

Particles are considered neutral if the zeta potential is between −10 and +10 mV, whereas less than −30 mV or greater than +30 mV are respectively considered strongly anionic or cationic.

Nanoencapsulation is proven to increase the bioavailability of drugs and deliver them to the right place, with the right dosage [31]. Studies regarding alginate nanomaterials initiated during the past few years. At present, an increasing demand is placed towards the use of alginate-based nanoencapsulation for controlled delivery of drugs. Table 2 highlights a few examples of alginate nanomaterial-based drug delivery methods. Compared with other particulate carrier systems such as liposomes, microparticles, and some nanoparticles, which are rapidly taken up and degraded by mononuclear phagocytes such as the Kupffer cells, alginate nanomaterials have shown better ability to withstand. They are desirable for encapsulating proteins, enzymes, and some other drugs while enhancing their stability and oral bioavailability [10]. A matrix with an aqueous environment, a higher gel porosity, and biocompatibility are some of the major properties in the majority of alginate nanoparticles [74]. Oral administration of drugs, such as proteins, remains challenging due to their gastric digestibility. Encapsulation in alginate-based nanoparticles could offer a solution to this problem due to their indigestible nature and sustained drug release rate (nano-obstruction effect).\nDelivering a higher drug concentration to a targeted site with minimal toxicity on normal cells is a desirable strategy in cancer chemotherapy. Some examples of clinical applications are albumin conjugated paclitaxel and liposomal doxorubicin [75, 76]. The significance of targeted drug delivery relies on the use of targeting ligands conjugated with nanoparticles, thereby increasing the nanoparticle accumulation at the site of tumors [37, 77].\n22\nGlycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrizin are common ligands used in targeted drug delivery systems [69].\nDrug entrapped magnetic nanoparticles, allows the rapid release of drugs following the application of a magnetic force. Magnetic nanoparticles integrated with targeting ligands are presently used to deliver radionuclide atoms and anticancer drugs to targeted tumors [78]. The heat generated due to oscillations induced by a high-frequency magnetic field could be used to destroy malignant tumors (hyperthermia treatment). It is a bi-modal approach against cancer achieving combined chemotherapy and hyperthermia effects [66]. Inter-particle interaction in nanoparticles resulting from magnetic field limits magneto-assisted drug delivery and controlled release. Tetra-layered biopolymer (chitosan/alginate) nanoparticles fabricated around MnFe2O4 nanoparticles via ionotropic gelation has indicated greater thermal stability, without shielding the magnetization while having a decreased inter-particle interactions ideal for magneto-assisted drug delivery [34]. Near-infrared laser photothermal therapy is another minimally invasive approach for treating localized cancer. Calcium alginate nanohydrogel encapsulated drug-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles conjugated with gold nanorods (cytocompatible and approved by FDA) found to be sensitive to localized photothermal degradation. These particles, too could be utilized in combination therapy [30]."

Natural polymers possess advantageous characteristics such as hydrophilicity, less-immune resistance, nontoxicity, enhanced cell adhesion, and proliferation, those which are preferable for tissue engineering [88]. With recent advancements in the fabrication of nanocomposite fibrous scaffolds, alginate has received much attention due to its biocompatible properties. Alginatecontaining nanofibers are widely investigated as tissue engineering scaffolds for bone, cartilage, and skin [51]. Alginates bears structural resemblance to glycosaminoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix in human tissues [88]. Especially for the engineering of bone scaffolds, the controlled release of Ca2+ over a long period is desirable for enhancing osteoblastic activity to stimulate in-situ bone regeneration [61]. Based on several studies, hydroxyapatite/alginate nanocomposite fibrous scaffolds are seen ideal for the adhesion, growth, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblasts followed by in situ mineralization [9, 51, 89, 90] indicating promising ability to be used in bone tissue engineering. 3D printing in this regard is increasingly studied for fabricating tissue scaffolds, especially bone tissues with greater control over the size of filaments and pores, complex shapes, and porosity enhancing desirable mechanical properties [91, 92]. Herein alginate does not participate in the nanoparticle formation, rather it stabilizes hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and provides the hydrogel matrix for cells and initial mechanical strength to the mineralizing tissue.\n27\nCa-alginate hydrogel wound dressings are renowned for regulating moisture, antiinflammatory properties, and promoting collagen synthesis resulting in reduced coagulation time, rapid granulation, reepithelization, and promote the differentiation of keratinocyte and increase proliferation of fibroblasts mainly due to the controlled release of Ca2+ [93].

In recent literature, hydrogels composites and nanoparticles have outcompeted conventional adsorbents, particularly in terms of their adsorption capacity and larger effective surface area [5]. Alginates are extensively investigated biopolymers capable of removing metal ions from aqueous solutions. The negatively charged carboxylate groups have a greater affinity/chelating ability towards cations [95]. Encapsulation reduces the agglomeration of nanoparticles by embedding them in the alginate matrix, while increasing the effective surface area, thus increasing their adsorption and catalytic performance [96]. Construction of porous alginate-based beads has shown enhanced adsorption [56].\nOrganic dyes from industrial effluents cause several complications, including cancer, allergy, skin irritation, dermatitis, and mutations [97]. Nanocomposite adsorbents designed by impregnating nanoscale metallic or bimetallic particles into alginate (or another polymer) based nanoparticles are applied as redox reagents or catalysts for the degradation of environmental contaminants, such as azo dyes, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), organochlorine pesticides, halogenated aliphatics, nitroaromatics and halogenated herbicides\n28\n[98]. Further, these nanoparticles could be integrated with a magnetic core allowing their recovery using a magnetic field. Immobilization of nanoparticles with certain enzymes such as glucose oxidase, laccase, that could degrade organic dyes is proven to be an effective strategy in wastewater treatment [99]. Other than absorption, enzyme immobilization could offer simultaneous adsorption and degradation of the organic pollutants allowing continuous or multiple usage times per application.

[2014] describe the development of fluorescence-mediated glucose detecting biosensors using glucose oxidase loaded alginate nano-microspheres. The operation basics are based on the use of fluorescence quenching near-infrared radiation (NIR) of the oxygen-sensitive dye, RUDPP. Aggregationinduced emission (AIE) is a unique fluorescence phenomenon that has gained great interest in biological imaging applications. Oxidized sodium alginate conjugated PhE-NH2 polymeric nanoparticles are described to possess such characteristics with desirable properties such as high water dispersibility, good photostability, intense fluorescence, low critical micelle concentrations, desirable cell uptake, and ultrahigh biocompatibility making them promising candidates for biological imaging applications [42]. Alginate from marine seaweeds is described to be resourceful in comparison with other synthetic or commercial polymers used in the synthesis of AIE-active polymeric nanoparticles.\nGene therapy is a hopeful approach for treating acquired and inherited diseases based on modifying the gene expression. Genetic material is introduced into the cells to compensate abnormal genes or to synthesize beneficial proteins. Presently there is a high demand for research centered on developing biocompatible gene carriers using non-toxic biopolymeric\n31\nnanoparticles.

A broad description of alginate-based drug delivery systems for tuberculosis are presented by [106]. The preparation of a nanocarrier system for inhalation delivery of antimycobacterial compound rifampicin is described by Scolari et al. [2019]. Herein the nanocapsules are synthesized by coating Tween 80 dissolved rifampicin loaded sodium alginate emulsion (pH 5.5) with chitosan in an aqueous solution containing acetic acid (pH 4.5) under rapid mixing following ionic gelation method. The nanoparticles are then separated by centrifugation. In another similar study, rifampicin is encapsulated in alginate-chitosan nanoparticles with an entrapment efficiency by ionotropic gelation by loading the drug to a pre-gel state of alginate and chitosan. Aqueous honey has been used as a surfactant and a stabilizer. Nanoparticles are formed following the drop-wise addition of 1 % calcium chloride solution with continuous stirring while maintaining the pH at 5.5. Following ultra-sonication for 5 min, nanoparticles have been collected by centrifugation [108].\nWater remediation by polymer nanocomposites is an emerging area of research for disinfecting bacteria-contaminated water. Zinc oxide nanoparticles encapsulated sodium alginate nanocomposites have shown efficiency in inactivating bacteria in synthetic and\n32\nsurface water contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [29, 109]. The inactivation could be improved with dose-dependent nanocomposite supplementation and increasing contact time. Moreover, the leached Zn2+ in water was within the recommended limits, which are desirable for its application. These nanoparticles possess potential applications for water treatment.\nThe use of electrospun mats of polymer nanofibers incorporated with metal nanoparticles is widely investigated for wound dressing applications due to their antibacterial activities. Shalumon et al. [2011] describe the fabrication of sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, nano ZnO composite nanofibers by electrospinning. These have shown adequate antibacterial activity, reduced cytotoxicity, and cell adhesion properties providing the potential to be used in wound dressing applications. Propolis is known to contain numerous polyphenols with a wide range of bioactivities, including strong antimicrobial activity, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antitumor activities. Encapsulation of Propolis within zein/caseinate/alginate nanoparticles has allowed improving its bioavailability in intestinal fluid surpassing the corrosive gastric juice, which reduces its bioavailability [41]. These zein/caseinate/alginate-based vehicles may broaden the application of propolis and other similar acid-sensitive bioactive compounds in the cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Cinnamaldehyde is a natural preservative with good antibacterial and antifungal properties. However, it’s poor water solubility, volatility, and instability limit its industrial applications. Cinnamaldehyde loaded sodium alginate-chitosan nanoparticles, which indicate a slow release of the compound, would allow overcoming above limitations expanding its wide applications as a food preservative [111]. Nisin-loaded alginate-poly-l-lysine-chitosan nanoparticles are reported as effective against bacteria and fungus. It could inhibit Listeria monocytogenes growth at 4 °C over 21 days due to the sustainable release of the drug. These could have desirable applications in the food industry as bio-preservatives to increase the\n33\nshelf life of refrigerated, vacuum-packed meat products [38]. ε-Polylysine is commercially used as a food preservative in Korea, Japan, and in some other countries. Compared to εpolylysine alone, ε-polylysine loaded chitosan-sodium alginate nanoparticles have shown promising antimicrobial activity with an initial burst in drug release followed by a sustained release of the ε-polylysine desirable for food preservative applications [112]."

However, more investigations are required to increase the purity of industrially prepared alginate and to overcome issues on the potential accumulation in the body. Developing analytical techniques to study the heterogeneous structure of alginate, which depend on seaweed source and environmental conditions is a major prerequisite. Further studies are required for increasing current understanding of how the monomer composition of alginate, monomer attachment sequence and alginate molecular weight would affect the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and biocompatibility. In this manor studying structural properties of alginate in major seaweeds, which is used for industrial alginate production, is an immense requirement. Further verification of functional properties in proper animal models would endure the future advancements of this research area in clinical trials.
