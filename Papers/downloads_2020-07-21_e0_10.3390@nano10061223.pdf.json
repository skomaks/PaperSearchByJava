      "text" : "Breast cancer (BC) rises to 1.4 million new cases worldwide each year [1]. Regarding BC treatment, the clinical decision depends on the identification of prognostic factors revealed from classical pathophysiological and clinical data (tumor size, grade, and presence or absence of positive lymph nodes) [2]. BC is currently classified into five intrinsic subtypes, that have been defined as follows: (1) luminal A subtype or LA (estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, Ki-67 cell proliferation marker low, and progesterone receptor (PR) high); (2) luminal B-HER2 negative or LB− (ER positive, HER2 negative, and either Ki-67 high or PR low); (3) luminal B-HER2 positive or LB+ (ER positive, HER2 overexpressed or amplified, any Ki-67, and any PR); (4) HER2 positive or HER2+ (HER2 over-expressed or amplified, ER and PR absent); and (5) triple negative breast cancer or TNBC (ER and PR absent and HER2 negative) [3]. In the clinical practice, expression\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1223; doi:10.3390/nano10061223 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1223 2 of 18\nlevels of these biomarkers are normally used to classify patients for prognostic predictions and for the selection of a good treatment option [4–7]. Proteins that could improve current BC classifications could be detected using novel proteomics tools [8–10]. Moreover, proteomics might identify protein biomarkers defining differences in prognosis, therapy resistance and metastatic spread within a specific subtype. Some proteins and peptides have been identified as breast cancer biomarkers in nipple aspirate fluid [11], breast tumor tissue [12], and serum [13]. Notably, serum biomarkers present the advantage that the sample is obtained through a minimally invasive method and can yield valuable information about the breast cancer status. Furthermore, serum biomarkers represent a source of potential markers for the prognosis or diagnosis of breast cancer, and also could be potential drug targets. However, the discovery and validation of protein biomarkers presented in serum are masked by the presence of high-molecular-weight (HMW) proteins, such as immunoglobulins and serum albumin, which comprise 90% of the proteins present in serum. A high abundance of HMW proteins hides the low-molecular-weight (LMW) proteins when employing standard protein detection methods [14]. To overcome this limitation, different methods have been reported to remove or minimize the presence of such abundant proteins, such as on-chip automated platforms, commercial kits, immunoaffinity chromatographic columns containing immobilized antibodies, and chemical reagents (acetonitrile and dithiothreitol) [15]. Due to candidate biomarkers comprising less than 1% of serum proteins and being present in very low concentrations, it is necessary to isolate and enrich LMW proteins from complex mixtures for biomarker discovery. Different methods for the enrichment of LMW proteins from biofluids to find disease-associated biomarkers were reported [16]. In this way, different nanoparticles emerged as promising sorbent materials used in the enrichment of low-abundance peptides/proteins for subsequent mass spectrometric identification [17]. It is well known that the interaction of a nanomaterial with a biological fluid leads to the formation of a protein corona (PC) surrounding the nanomaterial. Using standard blood analyses, alterations in protein patterns are difficult to detect. Importantly, PC acts as a “nano-concentrator” of serum proteins with affinity for nanoparticles’ surface. Consequently, the characterization of PC could allow for the detection of otherwise undetectable changes in protein concentration at an early stage of a disease, or after chemotherapy or surgery [18]. The protein composition and content in the corona depend on several parameters, such as: (i) physicochemical properties of the NPs (i.e., size, composition, curvature, shape, surface charge and surface chemistry, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) [19–21]; (ii) characteristics of the biological media (i.e., temperature, and protein source) [22–24]; (iii) incubation time [25]. Our team applied different nanoparticles for the pre-fractionation/enrichment of proteins/peptides present in human serum [26–28] to discovery novel blood-based protein biomarkers of BC [29]. It was also found that the interaction of a nanomaterial with a biological fluid leads to the formation of a protein corona (PC) surrounding the nanomaterial, which is strongly influenced by the patient’s specific disease, named personalized protein corona (PPC) [30]. Applying this new concept, C. Núñez and co-workers found potential biomarkers for the prognosis and follow-up of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients [31]. In the present study, 42 healthy women (named healthy controls (HC)) and 42 BC patients categorized into 5 subtypes, namely luminal A (n = 11), luminal B-HER2 negative (n = 10), luminal B-HER2 positive (n = 7), HER2 positive (n = 6), and triple negative (n = 8) were recruited. Due to the colloidal stability, the high surface-area-to-volume ratio and the ability to conjugate with biomolecules [32], gold nanoparticles (AuNPs: 10.02 ± 0.91 nm) were used to incubate with serum samples of breast cancer patients and healthy controls, and the resultant protein coronas were thoroughly characterized and compared by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics.\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1223 3 of 18"

[34,35]. In brief, human serum (n = 2) were filtered with Miller-GP® Filter Units (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) with a size of 0.22 µm. Filtered serum samples (30 µL) were mixed with fresh DTT 500 mM (3.3 µL) in milli-Q and vortex 30 s. After the incubation at room temperature (ca. 60 min), the viscous white precipitate formed was eliminated by centrifugation at 18,840× g (20 min). Supernatants were collected to new tubes. Another function of DTT was the reduction of disulfide bonds, thus proteins presented in supernatants are reduced.

      "text" : "Blood samples of 42 BC patients and 42 HC were collected. The group of BC patients was divided into the different subtypes: LA (n = 11), LB− (n = 10), LB+ (n = 7), HER2+ (n = 6), and TNBC (n = 8). All samples have been recruited, processed and analyzed in the same way. The treatment of the serum samples with DTT resulted in the elimination of the high abundant proteins and the reduction of the disulfide bonds of proteins presented in the remaining fraction. The resulting cysteines were then alkylated (blocked) with IAA. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibit colloidal stability, high surface-area-to-volume ratio and the ability to conjugate with biomolecules. For this reason, AuNPs emerged as promising sorbent materials used in the enrichment of low-abundance peptides/proteins for subsequent mass spectrometric identification. In the present work, we used AuNPs (10.02± 0.91 nm) to pre-concentrate low-abundance proteins presented in the sera of BC patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 42), and the resultant protein coronas were thoroughly characterized to identify potential protein biomarkers. The formation of the PC is a dynamic process that depends on multiple factors, including the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials such as size, composition, curvature shape, surface chemistry and surface charge, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Furthermore, other parameters that also influenced the formation of the PC are the characteristics of biological media, such as protein concentrations, protein source, and choice of anticoagulant and flow status. Importantly, the pH, temperature, and incubation time are factors that also modulate the interaction of NPs with biological media. In the present work, the interaction of colloidal AuNPs (10.02 ± 0.91 nm) with serum samples was carried out adjusting the pH to 5.8, at 37 ◦C for 30 min, following an optimized protocol [31,33]. Thus, serum samples were further processed in duplicate as described in Section 2.6. TEM and ζ-potential measurements showed that after the incubation of AuNPs (10.02 ± 0.91 nm) with the serum of HC and BC patients, an increase in their size was observed due to the formation of the PC, from 10.02 ± 0.91 nm to 12.17 ± 0.98 nm and 12.14 ± 0.82 nm, respectively. After the incubation with serum, the mean particle surface charge of the AuNPs (10.02 ± 0.91 nm) became less negative ranging from −37.0 mV to −29.7 mV. This effect is probably due to a preferential interaction between the AuNPs surface with positively charged proteins [41,42] (see Figures S1–S3). After the interaction of reduced and alkylated serum aliquots with AuNPs (10.02 ± 0.91 nm), two protein fractions were obtained in each case: (a) a pellet fraction of proteins bound to the nanoparticle surface, named protein corona (PC), and (b) a supernatant of unbound proteins that was discarded. Only the proteins of the pellet fraction (PC) were separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin and identified by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)."

N utrophils can actively stabilize and intensify th altern tive activation pathway of complement by secretion of CFP as part of the innate defense to produce an immune response [54].\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1223 10 of 18\nAs mentioned above, inflammation is the hallmark of the immune system activation, which develops a complex and specific role. Neutrophils are the first cells to appear on stage, whose secretory products amplify and modulate the inflammatory reaction [55]. Some of these products are pantetheinase (VNN1) [56], beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) [57] and the immunogenic protein calprotectin (S100A8/A9) [58]. Particularly, increased production and release of B2M are present in certain malignancies, including solid tumors like BC [59]. Furthermore, the level of B2M also is one of the most important independent prognostic factors and predictors of survival in patients with BC [60], and B2M played a role in creating multidrug-resistance [61]. The expression and function of S100A8 and S100A9 in BC is controversial. While some evidence supports a pro-malignancy role for S100A8 and S100A9 in breast cancer [62,63], other researchers consider that S100A8 and S100A9 expression is positive to BC prognosis [64,65]. In the present work, S100A8/A9 was identified in the serum of BC patients with the subtype LB+. Particularly, strong expression and secretion of S100A8/A9 were found to be implicated in the poor prognosis of Her2+/basal-like subtypes of BC [66]. Lactotransferrin (LTF) is also produced in neutrophils and stored in specific granules. Being a hormone-responsive gene, LTF may contribute to various hormone-dependent cancers, such as BC. F. Chekhun et al. [67] found a strong correlation between expression indexes of LTF and estrogen receptors (ER). Particularly, significantly higher expression of LF was found in ER-positive tumors than in ER-negative tumors (35 vs. 18%). These observations are in agreement with the results obtained in the present work because LTF was identified in the serum of BC patients with the LA subtype and TNBC patients. The anticancer activity of LTF has been observed in different cancer cell lines, including BC cells [68]. In this context, lysozyme C (LYZ), a cornerstone of innate immunity, also acts as an anti-proliferative protein against different human cancer cells, such as BC cells [69]. Particularly, in the present work, LYZ was identified in the serum of BC patients with the LA subtype, as cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP-3) that develops a role in innate immune defense [70]. Recently, lower expression of CRISP3 was associated with an improved DFS (disease-free survival) and OS (overall survival) in patients with mammary carcinoma [71]. On the other hand, the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) is one of the first-line antibodies produced in response to infection. It was also identified the ability of pIgR overexpression to promote cell migration and cancer metastasis, for example, in BC [72]. In the present work, this protein was identified in the serum of BC patients with the LA, LB− and TNBC subtypes. Two enzymes that were found in the serum of BC patients are trypsin-3 (PRSS3) and aminopeptidase N (APN). Both are proteins whose enzymatic activity is fundamental for stimulating cancer and endothelial cell migration and invasion [73,74]. Particularly, PRSS3 [75] and APN [76] levels were significantly higher in breast tissues than in benign tissues. Furthermore, it was also found that APN, in combination with other standard prognostic factors, can be used as a prognostic factor in the assessment of BC prognosis [77]. In the present work, the Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta (GDI2) and the importin subunit beta-1 (KPNB1) were identified in the serum of BC with the LB− subtype. Recent studies revealed that GDI2 [78,79] and KPNB1 [80] proteins have a key role in the development of multiple tumors by controlling tumor progression, including that of BC [81,82]; thus, GDI2 and KPNB1could be valuable anticancer therapeutic targets [83]. Furthermore, the 194 differential proteins found in the AuNPs-protein corona for the BC group, were classified according to their protein classes using the PANTHER database. Most of the differential proteins belonged to defense/immunity (21.5%), metabolite interconversion enzyme (13.3%), protein modifying enzyme (11.9%), cytoskeletal protein (8.1%), and gene-specific transcriptional regulator (5.9%). More classes of the differential proteins were also shown in Figure 4. Most of these 194 proteins played crucial roles in the immune system, probably due to the induction of an immune response in the microenvironment promoted by the breast tumor [84].\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1223 11 of 18\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 18\nFurthermore, the 194 differential proteins found in the AuNPs-protein corona for the BC group, were classified according to their protein classes using the PANTHER database.

The blood coagulation pathway was found to be altered in LB− and TNBC subtypes but not in LA, LB+, nor HER2+. After analysis of the protein corona, LB− and TNBC subtypes were found to be enriched in blood coagulation pathway with coagulation factor VII (FA7) and fibrinogen beta chain (FIBB), respectively. Inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways was also seen to be an altered pathway in breast cancer, which was enriched only for the LA and LB− subtypes in the present study. Analysis of the protein corona showed that beta-actin-like protein 2 (ACTBL) was involved in this pathway in the LA subtype, while myosin-15 (MYH15) and 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate phosphodiesterase eta-1 (PLCH1) were involved in the LB− subtype. Interestingly, the angiogenesis pathway was only observed in the LB− subtype, and ephrin typeB receptor (EPHB3) and coagulation factor VII (FA7) were the proteins involved in this pathway. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling pathway is one of the most important pathways that regulate growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation in mammalian cells [85]. Furthermore, it was also observed that cancer signaling pathways like epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were majorly associated with HER2+. The protein SHCtransforming protein 3 (SHC3) was identified as the protein involved in both signaling pathways. In\nFigure 6.

      "text" : "In this study, AuNPs (10.02 ± 0.91 nm) were shown to be a potential tool for the enrichment of disease-specific proteins of breast cancer in serum samples. The analysis of the PC formed around AuNPs (10.02 ± 0.91 nm) after their interaction with serum samples of 42 BC patients allowed the identification of 194 potential protein biomarkers, of which 72 have been found in patients with the LA subtype, 82 in the LB−, 59 in the LB+, 36 in the HER2+ and 59 in the TNBC subtype. The crucial role of these proteins in the immune system is probably due to the induction of an immune response in the microenvironment promoted by the breast tumor. Importantly, some of them are neutrophil-derived granule proteins that could be attracting candidate therapeutic targets in states of chronic inflammation and/or breast tumor development. Further study to gain greater insight into the role of the immune system developed by the biomarkers found in the present study may expand novel therapeutic strategies for BC.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/6/1223/s1, Figure S1: TEM image of AuNPs@citrate in aqueous phase and the characterization data, Figure S2.

    "abstractText" : "It is well known that the interaction of a nanomaterial with a biological fluid leads to the formation of a protein corona (PC) surrounding the nanomaterial. Using standard blood analyses, alterations in protein patterns are difficult to detect. PC acts as a “nano-concentrator” of serum proteins with affinity for nanoparticles’ surface. Consequently, characterization of PC could allow detection of otherwise undetectable changes in protein concentration at an early stage of a disease, such as breast cancer (BC). Here, we employed gold nanoparticles (AuNPsdiameter: 10.02 ± 0.91 nm) as an enrichment platform to analyze the human serum proteome of BC patients (n = 42) and healthy controls (n = 42). Importantly, the analysis of the PC formed around AuNPs after their interaction with serum samples of BC patients showed a profile of proteins that could differentiate breast cancer patients from healthy controls. These proteins developed a significant role in the immune and/or innate immune system, some of them being neutrophil-derived granule proteins. The analysis of the PC also revealed serum proteome alterations at the subtype level.",
