      "text" : "The ongoing energy transition to a more sustainable and lowcarbon future[1–3] pushes the development of advanced materials for energy and catalysis.[4–12] 2D or layered materials are interesting in this regard for their peculiar transient properties\n2D oxide nanomaterials constitute a broad range of materials, with a wide array of current and potential applications, particularly in the fields of energy storage and catalysis for sustainable energy production. Despite the many similarities in structure, composition, and synthetic methods and uses, the current literature on layered oxides is diverse and disconnected. A number of reviews can be found in the literature, but they are mostly focused on one of the particular subclasses of 2D oxides. This review attempts to bridge the knowledge gap between individual layered oxide types by summarizing recent developments in all important 2D oxide systems including supported ultrathin oxide films, layered clays and double hydroxides, layered perov skites, and novel 2Dzeolitebased materials. Particular attention is paid to the underlying similarities and differences between the various materials, and the subsequent challenges faced by each research community. The potential of layered oxides toward future applications is critically evaluated, especially in the areas of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, biomass conversion, and fine chemical synthesis. Attention is also paid to corresponding novel 3D mate rials that can be obtained via sophisticated engineering of 2D oxides.\nTwoDimensional Oxide Systems\nDr. C. J. Heard, Prof. J. Čejka, Dr. M.

Catalysis is one of the most important sectors for the energy transition and the development of new solutions for a sustainable and low-carbon society.[13–16] Over 90% of currently applied industrial processes for chemical production and refinery use catalysis in one or more process steps.[17] In addition, catalysis plays a crucial role in many technologies for pollution abatement, from both mobile and fixed sources. While most of the catalysts in use are well established, there is a great scope for the development of novel catalytic materials, particularly to address the new requirements from emerging areas such as: i) electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and plasma catalysis for the direct utilization of renewable energy sources; ii) catalytic processes for the use of biomass and other carbon sources (particularly CO2); and iii) use of fossil raw materials as alternatives to oil, such as methane or coal.[13]\nImplementation of the transition to low-carbon chemistry and renewable energy sources[2] requires a radical transformation in the way in which chemical and refinery processes are designed. The direct use of renewable energy sources other than heat (derived from fossil raw materials) requires wholesale changes to the core elements of the process, from catalyst to reactor design. While photocatalyst and electrocatalyst have been known for many years, their use in chemical industrial processes has been quite limited up to now and it is thus necessary to develop new solutions and approaches to overcome the limits of productivity and in some cases, stability. Consequently, passing from the conventional “thermal-type” catalytic processes to new “electron-driven” or “photodriven” catalytic processes requires the development of new catalytic materials, electrodes, and devices/reactors. Even for some of the areas that are satisfied by more traditional type of catalysts, such as the use of alternative C-sources for petrochemistry and refineries (largely based on oil), there is the demand for new and innovative types of catalysts.[18]"

Layered materials, with structures consisting of stacked nanosheets, which may be delaminated due to relatively weak interlayer forces, are a valuable option to develop new materials with controlled accessibility to the active sites and inner surface, and high surface areas.[19–26] These nanomaterials possess distinct properties from corresponding bulk-type materials, which can be exploited to obtain, for example, enhanced electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties. This allows the development of highly selective and active catalysts, for example, for the production of H2 or the conversion of CO2 into value-added molecules and fuels.[4] 2D nanosheets may be further manipulated to create different nanostructures, for example via self-assembly,[27,28] creating a large range of exciting possibilities. There are various examples showing that exfoliation increases the activity, long-term stability, and especially the selectivity. An example of emerging extraordinary 0D materials[29] is quantum dots. These materials are synthesized in such a way that the lateral growth is suppressed, leading to small sheets with pronounced edge effects.\nAs a result of the wide range of 2D systems available and the flexibility of properties that may be expected from them, research in the field of 2D materials is growing fast in many application areas, including materials for energy, such as nanophotonic,[30] optoelectronics,[31,32] batteries,[33] gas sensors,[34] ferroelectric- gated 2D- material- based electron devices,[35] and materials with enhanced light–matter interactions.[36] There are many common aspects related to the control of the nanostructure in these advanced applications, which motivate the converging development of materials for catalytic and energy applications.[37,38]\nVarious classes of 2D nanomaterials have been reported in the literature, with the state of the art for energy applications recently reviewed by Tan et al.[39] They include graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), metal phosphorus trichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), metal oxides and 2D zeolites, transition metal oxyhalides, metal halides, perovskites and niobates, silicates and hydroxides (clays), metal−organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent−organic frameworks (COFs), and other systems.\nFrom the point of view of catalysis, and limiting ourselves to oxide type materials, the most important classes of materials are clays and LDHs, pillared clays, perovskites and 2D zeolites. These materials will make up the core of discussion in this review."

They predicted that the activity can be further optimized by doping with transition metals.[53] A wide range of 3d, 4d, and 5d metal dopants were considered, showing that all metals helped reduce the overpotentials required to achieve water oxidation, and the rate determining step varies between the four-proton coupled electron transfer steps of the reaction, depending on the dopant."

An alternative explanation for increased redox capacity of Li-rich layered materials was set out by Seo et al.[73] Using hybrid DFT calculations, the authors determined that specific Li–O–Li bridging geometries generate labile oxygen electrons lying near the Fermi energy, which are competitive with TM electrons for oxidation. This interpretation opens the possibility to surpass the theoretical limits set by the electron exchange capacity of the transition metal, by tuning the structure of the layered oxide.[71,74]"

Yields close to 100% could be realized, depending on the alcohol. It is important to remark how this class of catalysts could be successfully applied in reactions requiring a multifunctional behavior to realize in one-pot (cascade reactions) conversions, which would otherwise require multiple separate steps, which come with the consequence of higher costs and environmental impact."

The catalyst was designed to make simultaneous use of the redox properties of the Pd dopant, and the acidic properties of the pillared clay, which are both predicted to be necessary for the reactivity.[76] It was observed that the pillared clay exhibited higher conversion than the commercial catalyst (Pd/Pt/γ-alumina) for at least the temperature range of 673–823 K, and reached 90% conversion at a 150 K lower temperature, implying better activity over a wider temperature range."

In contrast to other types of 2D materials, 2D zeolites can be synthesized by both bottom-up as well as top-down approaches, each of them having some advantages as well as limitations, as will be discussed later in more detail. New synthesis methodologies allow for a control of the physical characteristics of zeolite layers, and subsequent exploitation in a range of chemical applications. One example is in liquid-phase short chain aromatic alkylation. Another is the enhanced processing of larger molecules, utilizing 2D analogs of the MWW zeolite family, or the improved long-term performances of single and multilayer nanosheets with the MFI topology.[77] Detailed descriptions of the successful utilization of 2D zeolites and the current challenges in the field are given in Section 3.

      "heading" : "1.3.7. Encapsulation with Oxides",
      "text" : "Fu and Bao[44] recently reviewed the possibilities for catalysis in the confined space below and between 2D materials, which are characterized by strong intraplanar bonding and\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (4 of 33)\nweak interplanar interactions. They denoted this new area as “chemistry under 2D cover,” which covers a diverse range of chemistry, from intercalation of molecules, to film growth on the underlying surface, to catalysis. The 2D confined space results in enhanced surface reactions, something in between the reactivity in the rigid void space of zeolites, and the flexible environment at the reactive sites of enzymes. It is important to remark that the intercalating space beneath supported nanolayers acts not only as a type of nanoreactor host space, but also induces a change in the reactive species.\nThe same concept may be applied to a thin porous 2D overlayer, which encapsulates supported catalytic nanoparticles (Figure 1, top). This concept has often been used to control accessibility to the active surface of the reactants, in order to avoid side reactions. An example is the work of Doman and coworkers[78] who encapsulated Rh nanoparticles (supported over a Ga-oxynitrate semiconductor) in a thin porous La-oxide shell to avoid contact between O2 and the Rh particles, while keeping the Rh surface accessible for protons. As a result, the formation of H2 in water splitting (Figure 1, bottom) was substantially enhanced. A number of similar examples may be found, including some industrial catalysts, which use a 2D-type porous surface layer to protect the underlying catalyst from poisoning.\nIn addition, Fu and Bao[44a] showed that the confined space may induce changes in the properties of the intercalated species, creating metastable forms that are otherwise difficult to prepare via traditional synthesis protocols. For example, unstable FeO nanoislands can be formed due to the confinement effect at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates [Pt(111)].[79] The stabilization effect has been attributed to the\ninterface confinement energy, which is the energy lowering due to interfacing of the 2D structure with a substrate; it decreases in the order Pt(111) > Au(111) > graphene.[79b]"

These ultrathin electrides were indicated as “electrenes.” Electrenes possess exciting properties, such as high electron mobility, high carrier concentrations, and low work functions. The potential applications include catalysis (in particular, electrocatalysis), batteries and transparent conductors."

      "heading" : "1.4. Why 2D and Layered Oxide Materials",
      "text" : "A general question is why specific attention should be paid to these 2D and layered oxide materials, e.g., why they are relevant and “different” from other catalysts or bulk-type oxides. To discuss these aspects, it may be useful to first comment shortly that we consider here 2D oxides when only a virtually bidimensional structure (single layer) is present, while layered (e.g., multilayer) materials are those in which a 3D structure is\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (5 of 33)\npresent, but with weak interaction between the stacking layers. By reducing the interlayer interaction, for example by swelling or exfoliation, it is possible to change a layered structure to a 2D-prevailing structure and form rose-, urchin-like or analogous nanostructures.[81] The reverse process of more or less ordered stacking requires instead the formation of a weak bond (through a suitable “glue”) between the layers to overcome the energy barrier related to bond dissociation between the layer and a solvent in which the layers are dispersed. These chemical mechanisms of synthesis, opposite to physical methods such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), which are too expensive to synthetize industrial catalysts, were previously discussed by us, regarding the general concept of creating and mastering nanoobjects to design advanced catalytic materials.[16b] In addition, the reviews cited on layered oxides dedicate significant attention on the synthesis aspects. We have thus limited here the discussion on the synthesis procedures, leaving space to the analysis of synthetic and characterization aspects for 2D zeolite materials. We consider this latter class in detail because the synthesis procedures are different from those of the former materials and need thus to be specifically analyzed.\nAs indicated before, we limit discussion to oxide type materials because we consider this area the most relevant classes of materials from the catalytic industrial perspective. We have thus discussed here clays and LDHs, pillared clays, perovskites, and 2D zeolites. However, there is a main conceptual difference between the first group of layered or 2D oxides and 2D-type zeolites. In the second case, there is a relatively rigid structure due to the high energy required in changing the angle of SiO bond. There is, in this sense, a higher degree of flexibility in the first class of layered or 2D type materials, with a consequent higher degree of stabilizing defects and nonstoichiometries. While these are considered typically bulk-type properties, with relevance often underestimated in terms of catalytic behavior, the effect is enhanced in 2D type materials. Metal oxide ultrathin films are a new class of materials, whose properties deviate from (sometimes also not having the equivalent) the bulk counterpart.[81f ] Surface relaxation phenomena and interface chemistry are clearly different in 2D oxide materials with respect to the surface of a 3D-type equivalent oxide. Strain, band alignment, lattice dynamics, charge redistribution, and defects are some of the main characteristics. Furthermore, symmetry lowering at the interface creates new environments that are not accessible in the bulk equivalent. As a consequence, the physicochemical properties, starting from phonons to the redox, acido base, and reactivity catalytic properties are different and may be exploited to design improved or even novel catalysts. However, most of these aspects are still not rationalized up to now.\nFor practical applications, 2D and layered oxides do not create specific critical issues in the preparation, besides the usual care required in industrial preparation of pellets that the nanostructure is preserved and enough accessibility to the whole pellet is guaranteed. While often it is supposed necessary that 2D-type nanostructures are arranged in 3D interconnected geometries, industrial experience indicates that typically there is no specific need or cost advantage in having a preformed 3D arrangement of 2D-type units. Nevertheless, as mentioned before, reassembling nanosheets into 3D-type materials can be worthy as a further element to control the reactivity properties.\nSasaki et al.[81,82] have discussed, for example, how a variety of layered transition metal oxides and layered double hydroxides have been exfoliated into unilamellar nanosheets that can be then assembled or organized through various solutionphase processings to produce a range of nanostructured materials. Addition of electrolytes into a colloidal suspension of nanosheets promotes their restacking, yielding a flocculate. The nanosheets can also be deposited layer by layer with suitable polyelectrolytes to produce multilayer ultrathin films, in which the nanoarchitecture can be precisely controlled. These nanocomposites have properties different from those of the specific layers.\nFor applications such as photoactive materials, a general question is whether a 2D-like structure increases the possibility of grain boundaries between the sheets because these boundaries could create sites for charge recombination, decreasing solar efficiency.[83a–c] A structure with well-exposed nanosheets and minimization of their contact points (such as a rose-like nanostructure), in principle, exhibits a smaller grain boundary (per exposed surface area which can be illuminated) than the same oxide in the form of a compact layer formed of irregular nanoparticles. However, practice shows that 1D- or 2D-like nanostructures designed to minimize grain boundaries are typically less effective in terms of efficiency in light conversion than films composed by the same oxides in the form of nanoparticles, as shown for TiO2 solar cells.[58c] In fact, lowdimensional oxides, as previously commented, may be more intrinsically defective than the equivalent nanoparticles and this fact overcomes the reduced presence of grain boundaries. On the other hand, photocatalytic applications differ from photoinduced current generation applications (such as dye-sensitized solar cells) because defect trapping sites may create a mechanism to enhance the reactivity of the trapped charges (electron, holes) for photocatalytic reactions. In addition, by preferentially exposing specific crystalline planes, photo catalytic reactivity may be improved. Thus, in general there is no straightforward answer to the question of whether the presence of a 2D-like structure is beneficial for photocatalytic properties, and specific studies that have analyzed in detail the above-mentioned aspects are missing. For the same reason, quite scattered results are present in literature about the positive or negative role of the oxide nanostructure on the photoinduced behavior."

The approach is to analyze the overlap between the diverse range of 2D-type materials and their applications from an applied catalysis perspective.\nThe promising 2D materials were considered in this review in terms of their structural features, synthesis methods, and applications including (photo-, electro-) catalysis, molecular sieving, spintronics, etc. Due to the diversity in applications across these classes of material, we do not aim to create a comparative list of qualities rather we focus on the possibilities and connections between types. Where fair and direct comparisons may be made, we do so, for example, in the case of the relative Lewis acidities of 2D versus 3D microporous silicate materials of the same structural class.\nAlthough emphasis is given here to 2D/layered materials, in contrast to the equivalent bulk-type materials, we have to remark that different other type of relevant nanostructured oxide exists, for example, branched nanostructured films for (photo)electrochemical water splitting or networks of nanoparticles. The common feature of such materials is that by controlling the nanostructure it is possible to obtain properties different from those of small 3D-type nanoparticles.[38,64a,c] It is worthwhile to comment, however, that in these areas a general knowledge-based approach on how to control the properties and catalytic reactivity based on the specific nanostructure characteristics is lacking. Most results are phenomenological and there is still no unequivocal literature showing that a specific nanostructure is preferable over others or the reasons for this difference. In many areas of investigations into oxide materials, theoretical modeling has proven useful, both in supporting experiment and in providing insight into the physical causes of observed behaviors. In this review, we do not aim to undertake a comprehensive review of theoretical work in the oxides field. However, we do include relevant theoretical results, in particular for cases where theory and experiment were used synergistically.\nThe changing scenarios in refinery and chemical production and their implications on the grand challenges for catalysis have been discussed elsewhere, in particular in the “Science and Technology Roadmap on Catalysis for Europe”[13c] and related publications.[13a,b] We will thus not comment here further on these aspects except to remark how this roadmap clearly showed that new 2D catalytic nanomaterials are one of the most important areas to expand catalysis concepts and upon which research areas we have to focus."

Exceptional tunability, through defect engineering, transition metal doping and control of thickness, make UTF excellent model systems for oxide catalysts. Several good reviews exist for a more in-depth discussion of UTF synthesis and characterization.[89]\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (7 of 33)\nEpitaxial growth of well-ordered mono- and bilayer UTF is controlled by factors which include the oxidation state of the metal, the lattice mismatch between film and substrate, film polarity, and the adsorption energy of the film to the surface.[89b] Large lattice mismatches promote symmetry breaking in the film. Competition between lattice expansion, polarity reduction and a preference to expose low surface energy layers to the vacuum leads to structural distortions in polar bilayer films. In the archetypal UTF case of FeO upon Pt(111), a hexagonal (111), polar buckled bilayer is formed, with iron atoms directly bound to the platinum surface, and the oxygen atoms comprising the vacuum termination layer.[90] Freund and coworkers observed an enhanced reactivity of the UTF toward CO oxidation, with respect to the Pt(111) surface, which is due to a rearrangement of the film in the presence of oxygen, from a bilayer to a trilayer.[91] The energetic profile for the conversion, and for the extraction of O from the exposed oxygen termination layer to form CO2 are both found with DFT+U calculations to be exothermic. For the UTF of MgO(100) upon Ag(100), activation of oxygen was proposed theoretically[92] and then confirmed experimentally.[93] This behavior originates from charge transfer through the film to adsorbed oxygen, making the system a promising low temperature CO oxidation catalyst. Another example where the atomistic scale structure of the UTF is coupled to its chemical properties comes from Merte and co-workers, who used DFT+U calculations to explain the experimentally observed difference in adsorption affinity toward NO between FeO(111)/Ag(100) and FeO(111)/ Pt(111) surfaces.[94,95] The calculations showed that the weaker FeO adsorption over Ag(100) drives a decrease in layer buckling, which in turn increases the accessibility of the iron atoms toward NO adsorption. Additionally, the weak bond between Fe and Ag leads to a barrierless local structural inversion of Fe and O atoms during NO adsorption, which is an activated process in the more strongly bound Fe-Pt case.\nThe importance of the electronic structures of conductive supports, oxide films, dopants, and supported particles has been investigated in UTF on systems such as Al in SiO2/ Mo(112)[96] and Li, Al, and Ni in MgO/Mo(100).[97] It was shown by Prada et al. that unlike in bulk oxides, the replacement of the metal ion in the film with a non-isoelectronic dopant does not lead to additional holes/electrons in the oxide states. The dopant retains its preferred oxidation state and the conducting support either gains or loses the electrons required to heal the oxide 2p states. This behavior means that the support acts as a selective electron source/sink, and the film can maintain localized charged sites for use in adsorption/catalysis.\nThe role of direct charge transfer through UTF to oxidesupported metal particles sheds light on an important concept in interface catalytic chemistry: that of controlling reactivity through activation of the nanoparticle. Pacchioni and co-workers used DFT calculations to predict that facile charge transfer from the conductive support through the film will induce a structural rearrangement of gold atoms and clusters, in order to maximize contact with the surface.[98] The important feature is explained to be the electron affinity of the supported particle and the work function of the donor support metal. These predictions were later verified experimentally for Au on an MgO(100) UTF, and shown to be thickness dependent.[88,99]\nThis concept has been applied to thicker films experimentally and theoretically,[100] by doping Mo-supported CaO films with Mo, which implies that it is a general, tunable property of supported oxide nanosheets to activate metal particles through charge transfer."

      "text" : "Neutral layered oxides used in catalysis (MoO3, V2O5, etc.) form a great variety of structures. The role of the structure of the layered precursor system in the final activity of the catalyst can be seen in a number of examples, utilizing either neutral oxides or layered double hydroxides as precursors. A typical case is (VO)2P2O7, which is the active phase in the industrial process of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride.[101] The preparation of this catalyst in the active form strongly depends on the characteristics of the layered precursor phase (vanadyl hydrogen phosphate) and its intercalation chemistry.\nAnother interesting example is provided by porous FeNi oxide nanosheets, used as advanced electrochemical catalysts for water oxidation.[102] The topotactic transformation of the LDH ternary precursor, FeNi-LDH, is used to form a layered Fedoped NiO oxide which displays improved OER performance: a low overpotential of 213 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 32 mV decade−1, and long-term stability. Interestingly, Long et al.[102] reported that the FeNi-LDH precursor shows only slightly poorer performance.\nZhao et al.[103] studied ultrafine NiO nanosheets (about 1.1 nm) stabilized by TiO2, which are derived from monolayer NiTi-LDH precursors. They concluded that the NiO nanosheets display outstanding performance in electrochemical water oxidation due to a high proportion of reactive NiO (110) facets and the presence of controlled vacancies (stabilized on nanosheets and by the interface with TiO2 nanosheets). Specifically, Ni3+ distorted octahedral sites are created, which are active in water oxidation. In addition, the heterostructure interface between the NiO and TiO2 nanosheets makes the NiO nanosheets more acidic, promoting the adsorption of OH−, which leads to improved OER activity.\nThese results clearly show the difficulty in the determination of the nature of the catalytic active sites and the relationship between the precursor, the nanosheet structure and the active sites. However, they also highlight the large range of possibilities in tuning the properties of 2D-type nano-oxides and improving their catalytic behavior. The role of the precursor in final catalyst activity is a crucial one, particularly in the case of hydroxides, and is one we will revisit in later sections."

The result is a\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The high surface area and porosity are beneficial for their use as supercapacitor electrodes. The performance is significantly enhanced with respect to bulk V2O5 and V2O5 nanosheets, exhibiting an energy density up to 107 W h kg−1 at a highpower density of 9.4 kW kg−1 (Figure 2a, right). Producing this type of 2D-3D nanostructured material not only influences the active (accessible) surface area but also induces a change in the catalytic reactivity by stabilizing defects and/or enhancing the exposition of specific crystalline planes. In fact, as shown by a similar type of 2D-3D nanostructured V2O5 material, although obtained from vanadium oxalate using aniline as the template and reducing agent, a high selectivity is observed in the direct liquid-phase hydroxylation of benzene to phenol. The reaction was performed in the presence of acetic acid as a solvent (Figure 2b), which is likely involved in the formation of peracetic acid, which is the proposed effective hydroxylation agent.[105] The nanostructuring leads to stabilization of reduced vanadium sites that are able to activate oxygen and oxidize acetic acid to peracetic acid. On the contrary, conventional V-oxide catalysts are not selective in this reaction. V2O5 nanosheets also exhibited photocatalytic H2 production activity superior to a commercially available V2O5 powder.[106] This is likely due to the more exposed (001) crystalline plane in the nanosheet. These examples show that 3D assemblies of 2D nanosheets can show improved performance with respect to the bulk oxides in various reactions, from charge storage (Figure 2a), to selective oxidation (Figure 2b) to H2 photogeneration (Figure 2c)."

KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (9 of 33)\nin the catalytic performance was related to the modification of the Ni XPS signal (the satellite II/main peak ratio), which, together with other results, indicate that the formation of nanosheets changes the reducibility and O2-exchange characteristics of the NiO surface, leading to higher selectivity and activity. This demonstrates that changing from supported nanoparticles to nanosheets creates specific modifications to the surface reactivity.\nBi2WO6 nanosheets were reported as a robust catalyst in photo cyclization, specifically the synthesis of bioactive benzazoles (in the presence of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide).[108] As described in Section 1.3.2, ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets were found to show high H2 evolution rates, due to the exposed (001) facets of the layer. Free-standing NiO-MgOAl2O3 nanosheets derived from LDH grown onto FeCrAl fiber (to form a usable structured catalysts) were also successfully applied for dry reforming of methane.[109]\nA further example of catalysis by nanosheets is the enhanced water gas shift (WGS) activity that results from deposition of ceria and titania nanoislands upon Au(111). It was found by Rodriguez et al.[110] that deposition of either oxide to coverage between 20% and 40% leads to maximum WGS activity, despite the inactivity of all constituent species bulk counterparts. XPS experiments which suggest a buildup of oxygen vacancies were confirmed by DFT results. Calculations show that the bare Au(111) surface is necessary to adsorb CO, while the oxide interface provides the oxygen for CO oxidation. The vacancy thus formed is then important for the H2O to H2 conversion necessary to complete the reaction. Several other examples of interface activity of oxides on metal substrates are known, including Cu–Ce oxides on Au(111) for\nthe WGS reaction[111] and CO oxidation at Rh(553) decorated with NiO2,[112] both of which have been modelled with DFT methods alongside experiment. These results show the particular importance of the interface between nanolayers and the support."

Cheng et al.[113] used an array of NiO nanosheets on a carbon cloth as an OER electrode. The onset overpotential was found to be 295 mV, with a Tafel slope of 116 mV decade−1, which is in-line with, but slightly higher than those reported above for LDH-derived Fedoped NiO. Li et al.[114] prepared copper nanowires by anodic oxidation and thermal annealing, followed by coordination etching to produce a Co–Ni complex hydroxide, likely LDH-type, which grew as a nanosheet over the main Cu2O nanotube. This nanosheet acts as an OER catalyst, but by nitridation it is possible to also obtain an HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) catalyst (Figure 3). They could therefore be joined to form a water splitting system.\nThe 1D/2D nanotube/nanosheet morphology ensures a large electrochemically active surface area, good conductivity, and efficient charge transport during electrolysis. The obtained nanotubes show high stability and good current densities at low overpotentials (at an overpotential of about 280 mV, the current density in OER reaches 10 mA cm−2). When assembled together, the OER-HER system shows a current density of 11 mA cm−2 at a bias voltage of 1.65 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode\nAdv.

Therefore, the performance must be further improved, but it represents an interesting approach to create 1D/2D systems for water splitting and advanced electrodes.\nZhang et al.[115a] developed a Ni–Co layered double hydroxide cocatalyst to enhance O2 release with respect to a carbon nitride nanosheet material. A somewhat similar system, based on selfsupported nanoporous NiCo2O4 nanowires with cobalt- nickel layered oxide nanosheets for overall water splitting has been proposed by Yin et al.[115b] In 0.1 m KOH, this system produces a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 340 mV (1.57 V vs RHE) for OER. The same system also exhibits good catalytic performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER, producing a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotential of 52 mV and a Tafel slope of 34 mV decade−1.\nWu et al.[116a] recently proposed a mesoporous mixed oxide nanosheet array, comprised of Co-doped NiO/NiFe2O4 on a Ni foam as a highly stable, low water splitting system. The optimized system (Co6.25Fe18.75Ni75Ox) was found to exhibit excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of 186 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 38.5 mV decade−1. The same system also shows high HER activity, requiring an overpotential of 84 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2, and again showing a low Tafel slope of 53.6 mV decade−1. The stability was tested over 1000 cycles for a duration of 12 h of galvanostatic measurements. It was found to be stable over this range, for both OER and HER. A two-electrode electrolyzer using bifunctional Co6.25Fe18.75Ni75Ox as both the anode and cathode demonstrates active and stable overall water splitting performance with a cell voltage of only 1.583 V at 10 mA cm−2. Note that Ni-hydroxide nanoplates themselves show interesting properties as HER catalytic components, particularly when doped with Pt.[116b]\nIncorporation of catalytically important metals within ceria as single atom catalysts has been a recent area of interest for PEM fuel cell applications, both in the form of ceria nanoparticles and extended surfaces.[117] DFT+U calculations have shown that for a wide range of transition metals (Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Cu, Ag, and Au), the metal atoms can occupy square planar sites, coordinated by four oxygen atoms on the surface of ceria, and become oxidized. High stability against agglomeration suggests good potential as single atom catalysts. In particular, Pt deposited on nanostructured ceria films has been proposed as an anode catalyst system for PEM fuel cells, with high power densities observed experimentally.[118] Theoretical modeling has identified reversible switching between Pt2+ located in square planar {100} nanofacet sites, and metallic Pt sub-nanometer particles on the CeO2 surface between oxidation and reduction phases. These results are consistent with XPS experiments. The aforementioned materials, which are based on oxide nanosheets, represent an interesting direction for the development of advanced electrodes for “solar-driven chemistry.” However, it should be noted that the above results are based primarily on voltammometric or related measurements, or theoretical predictions, rather than on true experiments in water oxidation or splitting. The next step is to test their performance under realistic, operative conditions, in order to move from academic studies to development of functional electrodes and devices."

Wang et al. reported that Mn vacancies lead to a conversion from insulating to half metal electronic structure in the same material with both experiment and hybrid DFT calculations.[86b] Increasing vacancy concentrations lead to a monotonic decrease in band gap, while half-metallicity is retained, suggesting that defect engineering of UTF may be appropriate for low-dimensional spintronic applications."

The layers of clays are formed by the association of two or more tetrahedral and octahedral sheets, generally around Si and Al atoms. The simplest structure is that of talc; the dioctahedral analog is pyrophyllite. Talc structure is characterized by Si2O10 tetrahedral sheets and Mg(O,OH)6 octahedral sheets forming 2:1 layers. The layers are held together by very weak van der Waals forces. Montmorillonite is obtained by replacing Mg with Al in the octahedral layer of pyrophyllite. Other relevant smectites of dioctahedral clays are nontronite, beidellite and saponite. In general, various possibilities exist to tune and modify these “clay-based catalysts” to optimize their performance: i) different catalytic ions can be inserted within the interlayer space or in the pillars (in pillared clays), ii) functional nanoparticles or clusters can be hosted onto or within the clay nanostructure, and iii) acidity of the clay layers can be modified. Great potential exists in catalysis for composite and hybrid materials made from the combination of layered materials with other 0D, 1D and 3D materials, including quantum dots, nanotubes/fibers and nanoparticles, respectively. Examples of such combinations may be found in ref. [120]. However, the research interest on these aspects has decreased in the last years, being switched to other type of applications such as photovoltaic, photonic, electronic, electric, and magnetic properties.

      "text" : "LDH are emerging as promising candidates for photocatalysis in renewable energy production.[137] There are various potential advantages of 2D layered composite photocatalysts: i) specific directional paths for charge mobility can be present, which facilitate the transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, ii) a higher surface exposure with respect to the equivalent bulk material, and also a change in the material properties, iii) it is possible to form uniform multilayer structures (band gap tuning and heterojunction formation in 2D layered composites), and iv) it can be possible to form multifunctional hybrid systems. There are some examples in\nthe area of LDH photocatalysts[138] that take advantage of these opportunities, and therefore exploit the nanosheet characteristics of LDH materials.\nOne interesting example is given by ultrathin Ti-doped LDH nanosheets with a thickness of around 2.0 nm which incorporate M2+ cations (Ni2+ or Zn2+) into an LDH matrix.[139] They show interesting OER activity (visible illumination λ > 400 nm, AgNO3 as a sacrificial agent). NiTi-LDHs show the best results, and as shown in Figure 5a, a preparation by the reverse micelle method of a nanosheet structure leads to an OER activity (per m2 of surface area) about five times higher with respect to the same material with a bulk-type structure prepared by coprecipitation. The apparent quantum yield (about 65%) is also rather high.\nHunter et al.[140] showed the use of pulsed-laser ablation in liquid to produce [Ni–Fe]-LDH catalysts with high OER activity, which can be further promoted with intercalation of ions with Lewis acidity (Ti4+ and La3+) obtaining a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Nitrite ions bound by the N-atom to edge-site iron promote a linear increase in the TOF, indicating that edge-site Fe plays a major role in water oxidation. This suggests that in the FeNi-LDH catalysts, the main role of the nanosheet structure is to provide the tight coordination for the iron sites located on the nanosheet edges, with the intercalated ions or molecules within the interlayer space operating as tuning elements for the charge density or coordination of these edge sites.\nA different strategy is to prepare nanohybrids, also utilizing the layered structure. An example was reported by Gunjakar et al.[141] that used, for visible light-induced O2 generation, self-assembled materials prepared between exfoliated Zn–Cr-LDH 2D nanosheets and POM nanoclusters (W7O246− and V10O286−) acting as an electron acceptor. Figure 5b reports a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of the most active Zn–Cr-LDH/polyoxotungstate nanohybrid, with an indication of the OER activity with visible light excitation. Although the experimental conditions are not exactly the\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (13 of 33)\nsame, the nanohybrid approach appears not to outperform the nanosheet approach, although there is still a broad scope for possible improvements.\nTo optimize OER behavior, Xu et al.[142] computationally studied various mixed oxidation state MIIMIII-LDH for the oxygen evolution reaction. The calculated band structure indicates that Mg- and Zn-based LDHs are ultraviolet responsive, while Co- and Ni-based LDHs are responsive to visible light, due to their differing band gaps. NiGa-, CoAl-, ZnAl-, and NiAlLDHs are all found to have valence band maxima above the oxidation potential of water, which is necessary for OER activity. However, of these four LDHs, only the CoAl-LDH has a sufficiently low overpotential for water oxidation to proceed. In the work, experimental observations confirmed the theoretical result, that CoAl-LDH is indeed an efficient oxygen evolution photocatalyst, with an O2 generation rate of 973 µmol h−1 g−1. Furthermore, the MgAl and ZnAl forms were found to be inactive, as predicted.\nLDHs have also been reported to show interesting photocatalytic H2 generation behavior. One example shows that the intercalation of iron into MgAl-LDHs leads to activities in the production of hydrogen of up to 493 µmol g−1 h−1 under irradiation by visible light.[143] This can be explained by the beneficial incorporation of FeO6 units in the LDH, for which the conduction band energy becomes more negative with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. This electronic change facilitates electron transfer to adsorbed H+, to evolve H2. Xia et al.[144] reported that CuMgCr-LDHs exhibited the narrowest band gap and the largest surface area of the CuMgXLDH class (X = Cr, Al, Fe, and Ce). Consequently, the chromium-doped LDH shows the highest efficiency for hydrogen production under visible light of this group, with a yield of 452.9 µmol g−1 h−1.\nAn alternative strategy to direct photocatalysis of LDH, is to utilize the localized surface plasmon resonance (by Au and Ag nanoparticles) to enhance the visible light activity of LDHbased photocatalysts. Nanocomposites of Au/LDH (LDH = ZnAl, ZnAlCe) are effective at H2 generation in mixed solvents of water and methanol. The role of cerium in the later may be to drive oxidation of the supported gold, from Au0 to Au3+. This would enhance hydrogen evolution under irradiation, by pushing the additional electrons into the LDH conduction band, which in turn increases reactivity to form H2.[145]\nIn addition to nanocomposites comprised of metal nanoparticles with the LDH, Complex organic anions such as 4,4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonate (DAS) and 4,4-dinitrostilbene-2,2-disulfonate (DNS) can be introduced. This was done for Zn2Al-LDH, producing an intercalated organic–LDH system.[146] The DAS(50%)–DNS/LDHs composite was seen to exhibit a broad UV–vis light absorption and fluorescence quenching. This result implies that there is a photoinduced electron transfer between the donor (DAS) and acceptor (DNS) ions. As a consequence of this characteristic, the material is used as a photoanode, exhibiting a good photogenerated current (4.67 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs SCE) under UV–vis light illumination, together with photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this case, the LDH is used to host donor–acceptor species between the layers. There are thus several possible strategies by which LDH layered structure could be exploited, and\nindications should be considered only initial. There is still a substantial effort necessary to optimize these systems in water splitting, particularly using visible light.\nIt is worthwhile to mention the emerging area of photocatalytic CO2 reduction using LDHs. Zhao et al.[147] used ultrathin Zn- containing LDH nanosheets as photocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 into CO. DFT calculations indicate that oxygen vacancies (V0) are created by decreasing the LDH thickness. The high photocatalytic activity is explained to be due to these oxygen vacancies, as they lead to coordinatively unsaturated Zn+ sites in the sheet, which in turn drive the reaction. An alternative approach for CO2 photoreduction is to combine plasmonic photocatalytic nanoparticles (Au, Ag) with the LDH layers to increase performances under visible light.[148]\nLDH have also been incorporated in a tandem photoreactor cell (called a reverse photofuel cell) to reduce CO2 to methanol. Morikawa et al.[149] combined on the two sides of the tandem photoreactor cell two photocatalysts: WO3 for water oxidation and LDH modified by Zn, Cu, and Ga for CO2 photoreduction to methanol (Figure 6). The two hemicells were separated by a polymer electrolyte film. The LDH photo catalyst was based on earlier studies[150] on ZnCuGaLDH photocatalysts for the same reaction. The best performances (0.49 µmolMethanol h−1 gcat−1) were obtained using [Zn1.5Cu1.5Ga(OH)8]+2(CO3)2−·mH2O when the interlayer carbonate anions were replaced with [Cu(OH)4]2−. The methanol selectivity was found to be 88%. Interestingly, the authors report that Cu species in the interlayer region were more active than octahedral Cu sites, which are situated in the layer, by a factor of around 6 times. The photocatalysis is driven by a direct electronic transition from 2p states in the oxygen of the layer, to metal 3d, 4s, or 4p sites.\nLiu and Zhang[151] reported various other examples of LDHbased photocatalysts for H2 generation or CO2 reduction. Finally, Teramura et al.[152] reported on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with simultaneous water oxidation to O2 using LDHs with an M2+/M3+ ratio of 3 (M2+ = Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+; M3+ = Al3+, Ga3+, and In3+). They found the MgIn-LDH to have the highest activity of the tested materials, with an activity, which varies significantly with the quality of the layer stacking."

The LDH acts primarily as a medium-strength basic support, which avoids, or otherwise limits side reactions (in particular, the critical reaction of humin formation) and influences the characteristics of the support nanoparticles as well.\nThe adsorption of gold sub-nanometer clusters on a model LDH support of Mg(OH)2 has been investigated theoretically, with a DFT global optimization strategy.[153] It was observed that the surface OH groups have a profound effect on the cluster structure. Tilted planar geometries are preferred for Au10, while compact geometries become distorted by the surface. Strong AuOH bonds of around 0.8 eV per bond are formed, with an overall charge transfer to gold, which is predicted to facilitate oxidation chemistry. Such activity has been confirmed for low temperature CO oxidation by Li et al.[154] over layered MgAl-LDH, for deoxygenation of epoxides over hydrotalcite[155] and for oxidation of 1-phenylethanol to acetophenone on NixAl-LDH (x = 1–4).[156]\nZhao et al. showed for a layered CoAl LDH that well-dispersed supported Pd nanoparticles show high electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation[157] which is in agreement with DFT calculations. Charge transfer of around 0.1 electrons per palladium atom from surface hydroxyl groups generates a partially anionic cluster, in a manner related to the activation of metal particles on UTF oxide films. This particle charging then facilitates ethanol bond cleavage."

      "text" : "In most of the above applications, LDHs have been used either as a basic-type support, which eventually operates as a co-catalyst, or as precursor phase. The cases where the presence of nanosheets or of a layered structure is directly exploited are quite limited. One of the requirements for this is that the reaction conditions allow for the preservation of the layered structure. However, it is also necessary to prove that due to interlayer confinement of the active species and cooperative catalytic effects, the layered structure provides specific conditions that improve the catalytic performance.\nExamples in which the layered structure of the LDH is important in the final activity of the catalyst, but do not meet the requirements of direct application of the layers include the MgAl-HT, modified by substitution of Mg or Al with other transition ions (Co, Zn, and Cu).[136] This material is active in isomerization, dehydration and aldol condensation. The tuning of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites is an important factor in optimizing the catalytic performance. Anions located in the interlayer space of LDHs can also act as the active center for isomerization. Another such example is that of Gérardin et al.,[169] who reported immobilization of negatively charged Ni colloidal particles into the interlayer space of MgAl-LDH sheets, and then calcination and reduction of the sample at high temperature to prepare catalysts for methane reforming. The LDH layered structure therefore has the role of obtaining a good dispersion of Ni and limiting its sintering, rather than playing a direct role in the catalytic behavior. A further example is that of Barrabés et al.[170] who have intercalated negatively charged copper hydroxy citrate colloids and then hexachloroplatinate species into an LDH, to obtain, after thermal treatment, a bimetallic PtCu catalyst for the hydrogenation of nitrate anions. They report better catalytic performance from their anion exchange method than the best catalyst produced via conventional impregnation synthesis. This better performance is due to a higher dispersion of Pt and Cu nanoparticles under reduced conditions. In all of these cases, the layered structure is exploited in the preparation phase, rather than directly in the active catalyst. There is not always a clear distinction between these aspects, and further work is necessary to fully characterize these catalysts in future.\nA potential direct application of the layered nature of LDHs is exemplified by including immobilized anionic complexes, for example polyoxometalates (POM), within the hydroxyl-rich HT layers.[171] In epoxidation reactions, LDHs provide the possibility to avoid epoxide hydrolysis, which is an unwanted side reaction. The intercalation of POMs into the interlayer galleries of LDHs can also potentially inhibit side reactions, such as deactivating dimerization or self-oxidation reactions. A specific example includes catalysts prepared by the immobilization of [WZn3(ZnW9O34)2]12− oxometallate anion in MgAl-LDH.[172]\nThese catalysts show up to 99% epoxide selectivity, 95% H2O2 efficiency and a TOF up to about 4 × 104 h−1 in the epoxidation of allylic alcohols. This remarkable result is attributed to high stability, which may be related to the confinement effect within the LDH layers, and a high dispersion. However, further proof is necessary. As noted in Section 2.3.3, the combined Ti4+doped Mont/HT catalysts also use the layered structure directly.\nIn conclusion, despite the large potential in terms of tuning the characteristics of LDH-based materials and the many efficient catalysts that have been developed based on LDHs, there is still a lack in the design of catalysts, which would effectively exploit the layered characteristics of these materials, beyond their use as supports or precursors. As discussed before, regarding oxide nanosheets, there are possibilities to stabilize ions within the nanosheet or at the edge in a metastable coordination environment, which may work in cooperation with the hydroxyl and basic sites of LDH layer and of anionic species intercalated within the layers, Therefore, although these catalysts are well known, there is still great potential to develop new and innovative catalytic materials."

The RP phases have the formula AO(ABO3)n and A atoms occupy interstitial sites between octahedral layers. Examples of interesting materials for catalytic water splitting are: i) titanate as Sr3Ti2O7, ii) tantalate as H2La2/3Ta2O7, and iii) niobate as Sr2Nb2O7. The layered structure reduces electron–hole recombination and thus plays a crucial role, together with other characteristics such as cation valency and layer thickness, in determining the activity in water splitting, as shown in Figure 7.[173]\nVarious layered perovskite photocatalysts have been reported to show interesting behavior in H2 photoproduction. SrBi2Nb2O9 was indicated as the most active of a series of Abi2Nb2O9 samples, where A = Ca, Sr, Ba, by Li et al.[174] A Bi5Ti3FeO15 layered perovskite exhibiting an Aurivillius phase\nAdv.

Domen and co-workers,[178] who were among the first to remark upon the properties of layered perovskite type materials for water splitting,[179] put attention more recently into a new layered perovskite (CsBa2Ta3O10) and its conversion to nitrided Ba2Ta3O10 nanosheets. The same group[180a,b] proposed SrNbO2N and HLaTiO4− xNx, while K2CaNaNb3O10 was indicated by Oshima et al.[180c] to be an OER-active system. N-doping of the layered niobate is found to greatly improve the visible-light photocatalytic activity.[181]\nAn example of the use of theory to rationalize the catalytic activity of perovskites comes from Suntivich et al., who revealed that the occupation of the transition metal d-band eg state is a descriptor for water-splitting activity.[182] The activity is determined by the oxygen adsorption energy to each of the intermediates, which is in turn governed by the filling of the hybridized state formed between metal d states and adsorbate oxygen states.[183] Grimaud et al. showed with combined electrochemical and DFT+U characterization that the covalency of the MO bond in perovskites can control both the activity and the mechanism of OER reactions.[184] Highly covalent structures exhibit states with high oxygen 2p character near the Fermi energy, which can be directly involved in redox steps, providing additional reaction pathways to water splitting. These calculations were performed using the same method as Lee et al.,[185] who consider the thermodynamic effects of applied potential and pH using the computational standard hydrogen electrode method.[186] For photocatalytic applications of perovskites, DFT methods have been extensively applied in the analysis of oxide structure and electronic properties, in particular for band structure calculations. For an overview, we direct the reader to the review of Liu and Sohlberg.[187]\nAnother example of the joint efforts of experiment and theory in perovskite research is that of layered perovskite oxychloride Bi4NbO8Cl, which has recently been suggested as a stable visible light responsive photocatalyst for water splitting.[188] DFT studies[189] show that water adsorbs favorably on the (100) surface of the Bi4MO8X series (for which M = Nb and Ta, X = Cl, Br, and I) and the electronic properties are beneficial for water splitting. The band gaps are indirect and primarily comprised of O 2p states. This both aids against photocorrosion and enhances electron–hole separation. The lowest calculated overpotential for OER is 0.69 eV, which is lower than those of many commonly used OER photocatalysts.\nAs it is clear from this brief analysis, a single or restricted class of layered perovskites on which to focus attention as materials for water splitting has not yet been identified. Most are synthesized at very high temperatures by solid-state reactions, and thus have low surface areas. Processing for preparing the electrodes also presents issues, although some advances have been made recently in this direction. Bloesser et al.[190] showed that (111)-layered Ba5Ta4O15 nanofibers may be prepared with tailored diameters between 100 and 300 nm by electrospinning methods. Photocatalytic water splitting studies revealed an optimum fiber diameter (161 nm).\nIn conclusion, the wide variety of potential perovskite-based catalytic materials is a positive from the point of view of catalyst design, but work is necessary to narrow the field of this promising class of oxides and identify stable, active, high surface area catalysts for application."

      "heading" : "3.1. Features of 2D Zeolites",
      "text" : "Zeolites are well known as catalysts and adsorbents used in numerous industrial applications.[191] Despite a high level of understanding of zeolite chemistry and catalytic behavior, there are still many challenges in traditional (catalysis, adsorption, and separation) and emerging (electronics and optics, and energy storage) fields of applications, which cannot be solved using conventional 3D zeolite materials: i) a slow molecular transport in microporous systems, which can be eliminated by using hierarchical materials;[192] ii) the adjustment of zeolite structure and pore architecture at the nanometer scale, which remains a challenge despite the existence of many different approaches for the design of hierarchical materials;[192–195] iii) the synthesis of selectively permeable zeolite membranes with nanometer-sized thickness for high-flux molecular sieving.[196] The problems mentioned above can be overcome by 2D zeolites (also called layered or nanosheet zeolites) with the thickness of the layers of typically just a few nanometers.[197–199]\nThe synthesis of the 3D zeolite with MWW topology (MCM22) was first performed more than 20 years ago via the topotactic condensation of the layered precursor (MCM-22P) composed of regularly stacked lamellas with a thickness of one unit cell.[200] Taking into account that the zeolite layer with a thickness of only one unit cell could be considered as the unique zeolite building block, the discovery of the MCM-22P layered zeolite stimulated numerous studies devoted to organization and manipulation of such layered assemblies toward new materials and even zeolites (Figure 8).[201] In particular, the possibility to vary the interlayer distance using swelling[202] followed by pillaring with various inorganic[203] or organic[204] props, or exfoliation[205] was demonstrated.\nWith respect to potential applications, 2D zeolites should possess as a high aspect ratio as possible. Determination of the layer thickness and wrinkling for such materials becomes crucial because these properties significantly influence their performance in separation, adsorption, and catalysis (see below). Properties of 2D zeolites can be controlled by the alteration of the synthesis procedure and their accurate quantification is essential.[206,207] Zeolite nanolayers are thicker than other wellrecognized 2D materials such as graphene and its derivatives, MXenes or metal dichalcogenides and halogenides.[208–210] Properties of 2D zeolites are discussed below, including structural features, adsorption characteristics, and acidic properties.\nMeasurements of the thickness of zeolite layers can be performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and its variations (STEM, HAADFSTEM, etc.), or X-ray reflectometry (XRR) (Figure 9).[211–213]\nMost of these methods suffer from limitations such as the necessity to prepare the periodic multilayer (for XRR), which is\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (17 of 33)\nnot achievable for most of the 2D zeolites, high electron beam sensitivity of 2D zeolites in transmission electron microscopy, or unavoidable imaging artifacts that depend on the curvature of the layers (AFM). Therefore, methods for reliable evaluation of the thickness and structure of 2D zeolites are still needed. Kumar et al. reduced the beam damage of zeolites and characterized the atomic structure of a 2D zeolite using quantitative mapping of the reciprocal lattice.[214] This study included determination of crystal structure, sheet thickness, and the level of wrinkling. Evaluation of deviations from the wrinklefree structure of 2D materials is important because such deviations can affect the structure of internal and external surfaces of layered materials. Atomic-scale wrinkles can be found using STEM,[215] and quantitative mapping of the reciprocal lattice can be achieved using a large-angle tilt series of electron diffraction patterns. The change in intensity of the diffraction spot as a function of the tilt angle was considered as a characteristic of thickness. Changes in the shape of the diffraction spot were used to determine the extent of wrinkling. This approach was applied to a 2D zeolite with MFI topology—the layered form of zeolite ZSM-5 widely used in the industry as the catalyst or support material for various catalytic phases.[216] It was found that the thickness of MFI layers is about 3 nm, corresponding to 1.5 unit cells, in agreement with HAADF-STEM images. The wrinkling of MFI nanosheets was nonuniform and layers were wrinkled anisotropically with up to 0.8 nm average surface roughness. Similarities and differences in adsorption properties of 2D and 3D zeolites have been investigated systematically using adsorption measurements and molecular simulations, in particular for molecules relevant for catalytic processes (e.g., hydrocarbons). Xu et al.[217] compared the adsorption of 2,2-dimethylbutane, n-hexane, and n-nonane in hierarchical self-pillared MFI (self-pillared pentasil, SPP) and in its conventional 3D analog. 2,2-Dimethylbutane adsorption rates and equilibrium adsorption reflects the differences in porosity between 2D and the conventional MFI zeolite. Adsorption in layered material was more complex due to the so-called “edge effects” for longer n-hexane and n-nonane adsorbates. Only a fraction of adsorbates is confined in the microporous interior, while the remaining molecules are located in the mesopores. Bai et al.[218] performed molecular simulations of the adsorption of the same alkanes; a multistep mechanism was found to be responsible for the edge effect. The first adsorption step in 2D zeolite nanosheets occurs in micropores, similarly to the adsorption in 3D zeolites. However, the second adsorption\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (18 of 33)\nstep takes place at the pore mouths and corners formed by 2D nanolayers. The final step is the capillary condensation in the mesopores. It is worthwhile to note that for the studied 2D MFI zeolite, the adsorption in the micropore region at low coverages was practically unaffected by the existence of mesopores. This is an important observation with respect to the catalyst selectivity since it is generally expected that shape selectivity could be lower in layered 2D zeolites than conventional 3D zeolites.[219]\nSurface properties of 2D zeolites derived from UTL and ITH were investigated computationally by Hermann et al.[220] Interaction energies of small probe molecules (CH4, CO2, H2O, H2, and N2) were calculated for corresponding 2D and 3D zeolites at highly accurate levels of theory, including the vdW-DF/CC method derived from the DFT/CC correction scheme.[221] Small molecules without significant permanent dipoles or quadrupoles interact with the 2D zeolites with a similar strength as with the 3D zeolites; decreased dispersion interaction with 2D zeolites (due to lower density) is just compensated by the contribution from hydroxyl groups present on the surface. Interaction of molecules with a larger permanent dipole or quadrupole (CO2 and H2O) is stronger with the 2D zeolites than with the 3D zeolites due to increased electrostatic interaction with surface silanols.\nUnderstanding of the location, structure, and activity of acid sites in 2D zeolites is crucial for proper assessment of advantages and disadvantages of 2D zeolites with respect to conventional 3D zeolites. The ratio between external and internal surfaces increases by orders of magnitude in 2D zeolites as compared to 3D ones. Consequently, a large fraction of acid sites (either Brønsted or Lewis) are located relatively close to the surface silanol groups in 2D zeolites.[222] Figure 10 shows an example of a CO molecule interacting with the Li+ Lewis site on the external surface of 2D MFI. In addition to the interaction with Li+, the CO molecule is weakly interacting with surface silanol groups in its close proximity and this can clearly influence the catalytic activity of the acid site.\nLewis acid sites in 2D IPC-1P zeolite were investigated computationally at the DFT level.[223] In particular, Li+ cation sites in 2D IPC-1P and corresponding 3D zeolites containing the\nsame dense 2D layers as IPC-1P (UTL, OKO and PCR) were investigated and their Lewis acidity was classified based on the adsorption of the CO probe molecule. The higher CO adsorption enthalpy and CO stretching frequency of the CO adsorption complex is characteristic of Li+ sites with higher Lewis acidity. Small Li cations preferably occupy extra-framework sites on the channel wall in 3D zeolites[224] and there is only a small effect on the Lewis acidity of corresponding sites in 2D zeolites. However, Li+ sites on the intersection of two channels having the highest Lewis acidity[225] do not exist upon the 3D → 2D transformation and Li+ becomes tightly coordinated to framework oxygen atoms and adjacent silanol oxygens, and thus the Lewis acidity of these Li+ cations is significantly decreased. Lewis acidities of 3D and 2D zeolites with MFI and MWW structure were also investigated computationally, adopting the same strategy as for IPC-1P/UTL materials referred above.[226] While only minor difference between the Lewis acidity of extraframework Li+ in 2D and 3D was found for MWW, the Lewis acidity decreased in 2D MFI compared to 3D MFI. Together with the results reported above for IPC-1P/UTL it leads us to conclude that the decrease in the Lewis acidity of 2D zeolite with respect to its corresponding 3D analog becomes greater for 2D materials with: i) thinner layers and ii) larger concentration of surface silanols. Both of these effects improved coordination of Li+ (or other cations) with the framework and the decreased Lewis acidity.\nThe structure of alkali metal cations in the hierarchical FAU zeolite was investigated by a combination of computational and experimental tools.[227] Coordination of alkali metal cations (Na+ and K+) and their ability to bind CO were compared for regular 3D FAU, hierarchical USY, and 2D FAU. A strong effect of silanol groups present on the external surface was reported.\nThe Brønsted acidity of 3D and 2D zeolite CHA was investigated computationally by Ribicki and Sauer.[228] Absolute deprotonation energies were calculated at the DFT level of theory for zeolites with various Si/Al ratios. Much lower deprotonation energies (10–20%, depending on the Si/Al ratio) were found for 2D zeolites and it was ascribed to the smaller dielectric constant of an ultrathin dielectric in the vacuum compared to that of the corresponding bulk CHA, which led to an improved stabilization of thus formed charge. Brønsted acidities of various 3D and 2D zeolites were discussed further based on the calculated deprotonation energies, OH stretching frequencies, and adsorption enthalpies of small probe molecules.[227] Significantly higher intrinsic acidity of 2D zeolites than that of 3D zeolites was apparent from the differences in deprotonation energies. Acid sites on external and internal surfaces of zeolite Beta were investigated at the DFT level of theory.[228] Important differences between the properties of the Brønsted site on internal and external surfaces were shown. In particular, Si–O(H)–Al bridging groups are present in micropores close to the pore mouth while thermodynamically most stable sites are located on the external surface and they are formed by water molecules adsorbed on three-coordinated aluminum.[229,230]\nThe accessibility of acid sites for bulky molecules in pillared 2D zeolites with MWW and MFI topology has been assessed by adsorption of different probe molecules including small size dimethyl ether and pyridine, and large 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, which cannot enter the MFI micropores.[70,231] Liu et al.\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (19 of 33)\nused base titration (with pyridine and 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine) during ethanol dehydration reaction to investigate the surroundings of active sites in lamellar MWW and MFI zeolites and in their 3D analogs.[231a] The strength of the active sites in a different location was assumed to be the same. Saturation of acid sites with pyridine (which is assumed to bind to both, internal and external acid sites) resulted in complete suppression of the ethanol dehydration. On the contrary, saturation with 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine led to the rate loss in the range of 0–67%, depending on the pore architecture. This finding can be explained by the fact that the bulky 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine cannot adsorb on the Brønsted acid sites located in micropores. 2,6-di-tert-Butylpyridine uptake after titration saturation was consistent with the decrease in dehydration rate, which excludes the possibility that the reaction rate decreases due to pore blocking by the bulky probe molecules. Thus, the ratio of active sites located on the external and internal surfaces can be evaluated (it should be noted that reliability of this assumption is questionable since it does not take into account the difference in the activity of acid sites). It was found that only up to 8% of acid sites are accessible for 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine in 3D zeolites, while pillared MWW and MFI possessed 67% and 30% of external Brønsted acid sites, respectively. Thus, if the reaction involves small reactants, Brønsted acid sites in 2D and 3D zeolites behave almost identically, while layered materials can provide enhanced catalytic activity for larger molecules.\nA deeper differentiation and quantification of external acid sites located on the external surface or at the pore mouth regions in pillared MFI and MWW materials was performed by Wu et al.[232] In addition to the titration with dimethyl ether to evaluate overall acid site concentration, methanol dehydration in the presence of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine or triphenylphosphine was tested. While 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (with a diameter of 7.9 Å) can access both the acid sites on external surface and at the pore mouths, triphenylphosphine (with a diameter of 9.4 Å) can only access the former. Thus, the methanol dehydration rate loss in the presence of 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine or triphenylphosphine corresponds to the sum of surface and pore mouth acid sites or the sole fraction of external surface acid sites, respectively. In agreement with the earlier reports,[231] Wu et al. found that the sum of external acid sites concentrations (surface + pore mouth) was lower for MFI in comparison with MWW: pillared MFI possesses about 32% of surface acid sites and only 6% of those located at pore mouths, while MWW analog have comparable amount of active centers of both types (33% and 31%, respectively). The difference can be assigned to the 12-ring pore mouths in MWW, which provide a larger number of acid sites in comparison with MFI zeolite.\nAcid properties of 2D zeolites were also investigated using the 31P NMR technique.[233] Multiple types of Brønsted acid sites with various strengths were found in layered zeolites using different phosphine oxides, including trimethylphosphine, triethylphosphine, tributylphosphine, and trioctylphosphine oxides.[234] The number and relative strengths of acid sites were evaluated based on the chemical shifts and areas of the peaks in the 31P NMR spectra after adsorption of the respective phosphine oxide. It was thus possible to differentiate acid sites located at the external surface and in the pores (internal) by choosing the phosphine oxides with appropriate sizes.[235]\nChemical shifts in the 31P NMR spectra of trimethylphosphine oxide were correlated with deprotonation energies of the respective acid sites in 2D zeolites.[236] The resulting dependence was linear and it allowed an assessment of Brønsted acid sites distribution by strengths.[237] Seo et al. evaluated the acid strength and concentration of Brønsted acid sites on the external surface of 2D MFI zeolite using trimethylphosphine oxide and tributylphosphine oxide as probe molecules.[233] Analysis of the 31P NMR spectra revealed three types of Brønsted acid sites located on the external surface of zeolite nanosheets, characterized by different strengths, while four different internal sites were detected.[237] Using decalin cracking as a test reaction, the concentration of the strongest acid sites at the surface was correlated with the catalytic activity. A linear dependence of cracking activity on the number of acid centers was found.\nThe Brønsted acidity of 3D and 2D MFI zeolites was recently investigated computationally, using DFT methods, periodic models, and molecular dynamics.[234c] Acidity was probed by trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorbed on the Brønsted acid site in the vicinity of framework Al atom at the T2 position located on both the internal and external surfaces. Based on calculated 31P NMR of TMPO/H-MFI adsorption complexes, three types of 31P chemical shifts were described: i) very strong acidity, observed when a proton is transferred from Brønsted site to TMPO, ii) strong acidity, observed when a proton is shared between framework oxygen and TMPO, and iii) weak acidity, observed when a proton is shared by more TMPO molecules. Moreover, the computational study of HernandezTamargo showed that chemical shifts depend on the number of TMPO probe molecules in the vicinity of the acid site.[234c] It follows that the interpretation of experimental NMR data is more complicated and a good overlap between state-of-the art computational and experimental investigations is necessary."

KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (20 of 33)\nzeolites. MCM-22P was the first layered precursor synthesized by direct hydrothermal route[238] and it is the most studied 2D zeolite. Due to the absence of covalent bonding between the layers (they are held together by dispersion interaction and interlayer hydrogen bonding; for analysis of interlayer interactions see, e.g., refs. [239,240]), MCM-22P can be relatively easily swollen, pillared, and delaminated.[241] Precursors of FER and CDO are the other directly synthesized 2D zeolites. Both are composed of nonporous ferrierite-type silicate layers constituting the structures of 3D FER and CDO zeolites. Some of RUB materials (RUB-20, RUB-36, RUB-38, RUB-40, and RUB-48) can also be related to FER/CDO precursors despite differing in the layer-to-layer arrangement and nature of SDA between zeolite nanosheets (tetramethylammonium, diethyldimethylammonium, methyltriethylammonium, tetramethylphosphonium, and trimethylisopropylammonium).[242] The arrangement and organization of 2D FER/CDO precursors (PREFER) was also investigated computationally at the molecular mechanics level.[243] The critical role of cetyltrimethylammonium cation (used as SDA) for organization of layers was clearly demonstrated. Other types of layered zeolite precursors obtained by direct synthesis were reported during last two decades as well.[244]\nA sophisticated approach based on the spatial templating phenomena was developed for the synthesis of layered zeolites with MFI topology.[216,245] The idea behind it is in the use of multifunctional cationic SDAs having at least two parts, one directing the formation of zeolite phase and another preventing the crystallization in one direction. Such bifunctional SDAs contain quaternary ammonium groups (e.g., N+(CH3)2) responsible for the zeolitization and hydrophobic fragment (typically, long aliphatic chains, e.g., C22H45) preventing the formation of 3D crystals. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic\nparts of multifunctional SDA molecules can be tuned in order to adjust the structure of final lamellar material. SDA used for the preparation of such 2D zeolite stays located in pores after the synthesis, and the length of the hydrophobic aliphatic chain determines the distance between the layers. Variation in the number of quaternary ammonium groups connected by short aliphatic bridges allows for control of the thickness of the resultant layers. Finally, the change of the nature of the nitrogen atom surrounding (e.g., using aryl groups instead of alkyl) can be used for a tuning of the crystallization process, leading to designed mesostructured zeolite nanosheets or intergrown layer assemblies.[246] In addition to the design of appropriate SDA molecules, variation of the synthesis conditions can be used to change the arrangement of the layers. Multi- and singe-layer disordered assemblies of MFI nanosheets were prepared in this way by Na et al.[247]\nMWW zeolite was also synthesized in a layered form using multifunctional SDAs. For that purpose, simple cationic methylammonium fragments were substituted by adamantylammonium or diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane groups. In the latter case, the synthesis was performed in combination with secondary template—hexamethyleneimine. MIT-1 zeolite composed of delaminated MWW nanosheets was synthesized in one step using an adamantylammonium-based bifunctional SDA (Figure 11).[248] In the case of direct synthesis of layered MWW using SDA with diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane as a cationic head group, hexamethyleneimine (organic SDA typically used for conventional synthesis of MWW-family materials) was required to enhance zeolite crystallization.[249] Resulting 2D zeolites, in particular MIT-1, possessed superior textural properties when compared with layered MWW (MCM-56) prepared using the traditional hydrothermal route without addition of multifunctional SDAs.[248]\nAdv.

      "heading" : "3.2.2. Top-Down Approach",
      "text" : "The top-down approach is based on the chemically selective transformation of the 3D zeolite into its 2D form, exploiting the anisotropy in the crystal structure and anisotropy in structure instabilities in particular. To make the 3D-to-2D transformation feasible, respective layers in parent zeolite should stay intact during the whole procedure. Only in such a case, disassembly of the fully condensed zeolite can lead to the formation of respective layered derivative.[250] The most important requirement for top-down transformation is the location of labile units between the layers. Both of the conditions mentioned above can be achieved for germanosilicates; many of them are composed of silicon-enriched 2D layers interconnected by germanium-enriched props, such as double-four rings (D4Rs). High Si/Ge ratio in the layers ensures the stability of the 2D lamellas during the treatment, while low Si/Ge ratio in D4Rs provides required lability and facilitates decomposition or rearrangement of respective units. Gentle and chemically selective disassembly of germanosilicate zeolites with various topologies (e.g., UTL, ITH, IWR, and ITR[250]) is possible: Ge-rich D4Rs can be removed and resulting 2D materials have the structure of the layers in “parent” zeolites. In contrast to 2D materials prepared by the bottom-up approach, the top-down approach results in the formation of thin layers with thickness below one unit cell of a parent zeolite. This can be considered an advantage since the layers with a thickness of a few atoms are highly desirable. However, small thickness of the layers (in addition to the fact that some of produced lamellas are porous) leads to a poor stability of the respective 2D zeolitic layers. This can restrict their applicability for postsynthesis transformations such as swelling or exfoliation because of the severe conditions typically applied. One more feature limiting swelling and exfoliation of 2D zeolites obtained using the top-down method is high surface density of hydroxyl groups formed upon disassembly of layers. Strong hydrogen bond interactions keep layers together.[239,240,251]\nInstead of the direct use as 2D materials, such layered derivatives can be used as “extended” building blocks for organization (arrangement of layers assemblies in some systematic way) followed by reassembly (topotactic condensation) of the layers to form 3D zeolites. It was found that such reassembly allows synthesis of new types of zeolites not yet obtained by direct hydrothermal approach.[252,253] The general strategy of this multistep transformation is known as assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (ADOR).[254] First applied to zeolite with UTL structure,[255] ADOR was recently expanded to other 3D germanosilicate zeolites, including UOV[256] and SAZ-1.[257] In addition, appropriate shifting of individual zeolitic layers followed by condensation can lead to the formation of novel zeolites with odd/ring channels.[258] Those zeolites are still very rare in contrast to the many proposed by theoretical calculations and their synthesis has been considered as “unfeasible.”[259]"

      "text" : "Methods based on the crystal growth control were developed for the synthesis of layered zeolite materials in the absence of\nSDAs as porogens (organic molecules can still participate in the synthesis mechanism). Nontemplating methods can use the adjustment of the synthesis conditions or the control of crystal growth direction. Both the organic and inorganic morphology modifiers can tune the thickness of zeolite crystals. The mechanism involving morphology modifiers is related to their selective interaction with certain crystal facets resulting in the incommensurate growth rate in different directions. The main disadvantage of approaches based on the control of crystal growth is that layer thicknesses of less then several tens of nanometers are rarely achievable.\nDifferent organosilanes (such as 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl hexadecyldimethyl ammonium or 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl octadecyldimethyl ammonium compounds) were used for the direct synthesis of FAU zeolite with a hierarchical architecture.[260,261] Thus, synthesized zeolite nanosheets form “houseof-cards-like” assemblies providing the pore system consisting of: i) meso/macropores between the nanosheet stacks, ii) intracrystalline mesopores, and iii) conventional zeolitic micropores (Figure 12). Complex organosilane molecules used to affect the crystal growth are difficult to prepare and the removal of the unreacted part is required by the postsynthetic treatment. However, simple inorganic salts can be used as morphology modifiers as well. The isomorphous substitution of different metals (Co, Ni, Zn, etc.) into the zeolite MFI framework using tetrahalometallates or ammonia complexes of respective metals leads to an increase in the crystal aspect ratio and to the reduction of crystal size while the increased twinning is considered as a side effect.[262] Inayat et al. used this method to modify the morphology of FAU crystals using zinc or lithium salts.[263] Addition of zinc resulted in the formation of a zeolite with layer-like morphology (Figure 12) similar to that of FAU prepared using organosilanes discussed above. The use of lithium allowed the investigators to produce skeleton-like arrangement of layers with pronounced hexagonal (111) plates.\nPreparation of FAU zeolite nanosheet assemblies, similar to that obtained using organosilanes or inorganic salts, is possible even without utilization of any morphology modifiers. Using the border conditions between FAU and EMT crystallization, Ferdov reported the synthesis of intergrown nanolayers by means of zeolite nanoparticles recrystallization.[264] The FAU/ EMT crystallite branching appears due to this recrystallization and it is followed by the formation of submicron faceted crystals. The concentration of aluminum is an important factor because its high content accelerates the formation of aggregates of plate-like crystals of FAU/EMT. At a low Al concentration, the formation of desired nanoparticles was observed. After recrystallization of these FAU nanoparticles, intergrown nanolayers with a thickness of 20–60 nm and a length of up to 2 µm were produced (Figure 12). Similar to the methods utilizing inorganic morphology modifiers, such a synthetic approach is environmentally friendly and can be economically efficient.\nOne of the approaches leading to the construction of 2D zeolitic layers with highly developed mesoporosity is the direct synthesis of self-pillared zeolitic nanosheets with MFI topology.[198] Despite the organic agent (tetrabutylphosphonium) used in this work, its main role consisted in the initiation of repetitive branching via the 90° rotational intergrowths of the crystallites with MFI and MEL (structural\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (22 of 33)\ntwin of MFI) structure at the branching points, leading to formation of assembly of zeolite nanosheets. Tetrabutylphosphonium appears to be an important contributor to the anisotropic growth of single unit cell layers because it induced the formation of MEL phase during the crystallization of a self-pillared material. The formation of secondary-type zeolite domains within the primary-type structure may lead to repetitive branching of nanosheets (twinning mechanism) and it can be generalized and used for other zeolite twins. For successful implementation, the zeolite should exist in the layered form (with a small thickness and a high aspect ratio) and it must allow the branching to occur at certain angles.[198]"

      "text" : "Graphene oxide is a thermally and mechanically stable layered material with the well-developed surface. Graphene oxide can thus be used as a building block for the preparation of hybrid nanocomposites and soft materials.[265] It can be used as a 2D facilitating agent for the synthesis of 2D zeolite–graphene oxide composites.[266] Graphene oxide nanosheets were added to the reaction mixture during the synthesis of multilamellar MFI. Zeolite layers were grown along both graphene oxide surfaces and compatible intergrowth of both types of nanosheets was observed. Assembly of b-oriented MFI nanosheets with reduced intergrowth of zeolite crystals possessing only moderate BET areas (about 650 m2 g−1) can be obtained after removal of organic SDA molecules and graphene oxide layers by calcination. Note that the deoxygenation of graphene oxide phase to the respective reduced form gives a material with relatively high electrical conductivity that is orders of magnitude higher that in the as-synthesized composite (423 and 0.19 S m−1, respectively). This indicates efficient reduction of graphene oxide located in\nthe intercrystalline space of zeolite assemblies. The possibility to adjust the conductivity by the change of zeolite/graphene oxide ratio enables the preparation of systems with a continuously tunable electrical conductivity.\n2D silica and silicate films can be prepared on metal substrates, including Pd(100)[267] and Pd(111),[268] and Ru(0001)[269,270] and metal alloys.[271] While it is good approach to study 2D materials by combination of experimental and theoretical techniques, it is not a practical method for the preparation of 2D zeolites. This approach requires the deposition of a metal film on the support, the metal film cleaning, and then the deposition of silica/alumina source. If the deposited material does not strongly chemisorb to the metal, but rather weakly physisorbs, the layer grows incommensurately (e.g., the case of silica on Pd[267]). Doping with Al can cause the softening of the material, reducing lattice strain energy and formation of a commensurate phase due to the stronger interaction between the metal and the aluminosilicate layer. Stronger interaction in the latter case corresponds to the electrostatic interaction and partial charge transfer between negatively charged aluminosilicate layer and the metal substrate and results in PdO bond formation.[268] Systems prepared by deposition of silica on metal substrates do not have any silanol groups on their surface and they can be considered as perfect models for investigation of various properties using numerous surface science experimental characterizations. The Al atom in 2D layers prepared on Ru(0001) substrate preferentially locates in the vicinity of Ru and it is charged compensated by the metal (no Brønsted acid sites are formed); however, for Si/Al < 4 at least some Al atoms are located in the upper layer and BA sites are formed.[272] Properties of 2D aluminosilicate formed on Ru (denoted H-2dH) were investigated by a combination of experimental techniques and DFT calculations.[273] Results obtained for 2D H-2dH were compared with 3D zeolite CHA which has a similar topology.\nAdv.

      "heading" : "3.2.5. Postsynthesis Modification of 2D Zeolites",
      "text" : "The postsynthesis transformation of 2D zeolites can be defined as processes that alter the structure of nanosheet assemblies but not the intralayer zeolite structure. Well-recognized postsynthesis modification techniques include ionic exchange, intercalation (in particular, swelling), pillaring with amorphous or crystalline props, exfoliation, delamination, and interlayer expansion (silylation of zeolitic nanosheets forming interlayer-expanded zeolites).[274] The postsynthesis transformation of 2D zeolites with the MWW and MFI structure has been investigated the most. The first reported zeolite pillared with silica was MCM-36 (belongs to MWW family).[275] Pillared forms of zeolites can be prepared after the swelling of layers using an agent sufficient to break the interlayer interactions provided by hydrogen bonding and dispersion forces. To ease the swelling procedure it is usually performed at high pH[275] in the presence of a surfactant. Typical surfactant molecules possess small quaternary ammonium head groups and long aliphatic chains. After penetration of surfactant between the lamellas the interlayer space expands and the zeolite nanosheets become separated by several nanometers.[241] The addition of the source for the formation of interlayer props leads to pillaring with the interlayer distance defined by the particular surfactant. In the case of inorganic pillars, materials with desirable catalytic properties can be obtained, e.g., by addition of Ti or Sn sources together with silica.[276] In the case of organic props, multifunctional or hybrid materials can be designed.[277,278]\nIndependent and irregularly stacked layers of MWW zeolite (MCM-56 material) can be obtained directly by hydrothermal synthesis.[267] The absence of nanosheet intergrowth or other kinds of covalent bonding between the layers in MCM-56 was confirmed by its successful swelling.[279] MCM-56 zeolite is an exception because delamination of layered precursors is typically carried out via swelling, sonication, and acidification, i.e., under relatively harsh conditions.[280] Such severe treatment can lead to a partial recrystallization or amorphization of the delaminated zeolite. Therefore, the synthesis of suspensions containing discrete and nonaggregated zeolite nanosheets with intact crystalline structure is complicated. The structural deterioration and morphological damage (fragmentation, curling, and aggregation) of 2D zeolites during delamination or exfoliation may easily occur.[281]\nVaroon et al. recently reported the complete exfoliation of MWW and MFI layers.[282] Exfoliated nanosheets with MWW topology were produced from swollen precursor ITQ-1, while multilamellar silicalite-1 used for the synthesis of exfoliated MFI layers did not require preliminary layer expansion. Nonaggregated zeolite nanosheets were produced by melt blending with polystyrene followed by its removal. Above the transition temperature of polystyrene, the extrusion process provided a shear force, which resulted in exfoliation of zeolite layers. If the thermal treatment of nanosheet–polymer nanocomposite was used for further removal of polymer component, the obtained layers suffered from significant curling. In contrast, dissolution of polystyrene in an appropriate solvent (toluene) allowed the investigators to obtain flat, exfoliated zeolite nanosheets. Thus, a simple dissolution of the polymer–zeolite nanocomposite\nfollowed by a removal of unexfoliated nanosheet assemblies using centrifugation resulted in the preparation of morphologically intact nanosheets with MFI or MWW structures. Due to the completeness of the exfoliation procedure and morphological homogeneity, these nanosheets can be utilized for preparation of membranes by layers packing on porous supports during filtration. The following hydrothermal treatment allowed the preparation of zeolite membranes with thickness below 400 nm. These membranes possessed molecular sieving properties and allowed to separate p-xylene from o-xylene with a separation factor up to 70. The p-xylene permeability was reasonably high and reached 3 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 at 150 °C.\nExfoliation combined with efficient purification can lead to fabrication of even thinner zeolite membranes from 2D zeolites. Agrawal et al.[283] performed complete removal of unexfoliated particles after melt blending with polystyrene. They obtained MFI nanosheets with uniform thickness and lateral size with an aspect ratio of about 100. It was done using density gradient centrifugation based on the differences in sedimentation velocity of exfoliated and aggregated nanolayers in a fluid medium with density gradient along the depth of the fluid. Dispersion of respective nanosheets in aqueous medium can suffer from low stability due to a presence of long hydrophobic chains of multifunctional SDA on the surface of MFI layers. To optimize the separation conditions, different combinations of organic solvents were used to obtain complete dispersion of MFI nanosheets. n-Octanol was the best choice for dispersion of the layers and stabilization of the resulting suspension. Purification of exfoliated nanosheets was performed by centrifugation after insertion of nanosheets in n-octanol over density stacks created by chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, and chloroform (the sequence of solvents corresponds to increasing density). Four different fractions of zeolite particles were thus collected: 1) only exfoliated particles present, 2) containing two unexfoliated particles per 5000 nanosheets, 3) with large number of unexfoliated particles, and 4) primarily comprised of unexfoliated assemblies of MFI layers. Separated MFI nanosheets were used for fabrication of 80 nm thick films, which were further hydrothermally treated to form uniform membranes with a thickness of about 200 nm. Prepared membranes exhibited moderate molecular sieving properties (separation factor of p-xylene from o-xylene was in the range 25–45), while p-xylene permeability (4 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 at 150 °C) was improved in comparison with previous studies[282] and it was comparable to that of the alumina used as a support for membrane preparation. Improved membranes were recently prepared using exfoliated MFI nanosheets using the floating-particle coating method, which allowed for production of closely-packed nanosheet monolayers.[284] The density and uniformity of prepared films were higher in comparison with those obtained through Langmuir–Schaefer deposition and filtration methods. Nanosheet films deposited on porous silica supports by floating-particle coating were further modified by gel-free secondary growth to produce membranes and unprecedented ultraselective performance was demonstrated for separation of xylene isomers: p-xylene/o-xylene separation factor was higher than 10 000 at 150 °C (o-xylene signal was under the detection limit) and permeability up to 3 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 was achieved.\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (24 of 33)\nExfoliation methods described above are in general timeconsuming, costly, and provide only a low-yield of nanosheets, which can be fragmented. Alternatively, high yield and low cost direct synthesis of nanolayers with high aspect ratio was proposed by Jeon et al.[213] A nanocrystal-seeded growth mechanism triggered by a single rotational intergrowth was used to synthesize MFI nanosheets with a thickness of 5 nm and lateral dimensions that were characteristic for conventional MFI crystals (up to 2.0 µm). Initial MFI nanoseeds were ≈30 nm in diameter and synthesis was carried out in the presence of relatively simple bis-tetraalkylammonium SDA, which can limit MFI crystal growth along the b-axis and direct the formation of plate-like MFI particles. The obtained high aspect ratio nanosheets were used as precursors for production of defect-free membranes with thickness below 1 µm by coating of porous substrates followed by gel-free secondary growth. As a result, initial zeolite layers with a thickness of 5 nm were intergrown to produce high-flux and ultraselective MFI membranes with excellent efficiency (p-xylene/o-xylene separation factor was 2500 at 125 °C). Separation performance of membranes supported by porous silica was better than that of membranes made by exfoliated nanosheets (except those prepared by floating-particle coating) or nanoparticles with MFI structure. After five weeks at temperatures cycled between 150 and 50 °C, the p-xylene/o-xylene separation factor only decreased by 40%, from 2000 to around 1200. During the same period, p-xylene permeability slightly changed from 5.6 × 10−7 to 3.5 × 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1.\nThere are several modifications of melt-blending approach toward stable self-standing 2D zeolites, which can be found in the literature. Layered zeolite precursors (MWW and MFI) were successfully exfoliated by brief shearing or sonication with the assistance of commercially available telechelic liquid polybutadienes at room temperature (Figure 13).[285] The original procedure (using polystyrene) was considered as challenging due to the high operation temperature (>150 °C), low yield, and potential deterioration of 2D zeolites framework caused by a high energy input. Therefore, exfoliation of MCM-22(P) and multilamellar MFI was performed by their suspension in polybutadiene followed by brief shearing. Sonication is an effective procedure in exfoliating, but requires a longer time with respect to the flow treatment. The thickness of both types of nanosheets was consistent with that reported previously (2.5 nm for MWW and 3.4 for MFI zeolites, respectively). It was also found that\nthe end groups of polybutadienes play a crucial role in the exfoliation process. Nonfunctionalized polybutadiene and polymers possessing hydroxyl or carboxyl groups were also used for the exfoliation of 2D MWW. Nonfunctionalized polymers were completely ineffective in exfoliation, while hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene was the most efficient."

MCM-36 (pillared MWW) was shown to possess higher activity and stability in paraffin alkylation in comparison with rare earth metal exchanged Y catalyst.[286] MCM-56 (unilamellar MWW form obtained in one step-synthesis) showed higher activity, stability, and selectivity to the monoalkylated product in benzene alkylation with ethylene or propylene compared to 3D MCM-22 catalysts with same (MWW) topology of the layers.[287] Note that the 3D MCM-22 catalysts (showing lower activity than 2D MCM-36 and MCM-56 analogs) were commercialized for selective production of monosubstituted ethyl- and isopropyl-benzenes formed in the appropriately sized surface pockets of MWW.[288,289] Increased\nAdv.

Yet another 2D zeolite consisting of MWW monolayers arranged into the “house-of-cards” architecture (MIT-1) showed 3 times higher activity in alkylation of benzene with benzyl alcohol compared to 3D MWW (MCM-22) and 2D MWW (MCM-56) counterparts, which correlated with decreasing external surface area (513, 219, and 121 m2 g−1 for MIT-1, MCM-56, and MCM-22, respectively) and concentration of surface acid sites determined by 31P MAS NMR using trimethylphosphine and tributylphosphine oxides (210, 130, and 60 µmol g−1 for MIT-1, MCM-56, and MCM-22, respectively).[291]\nA comparative study of the catalytic performance of layered MWW zeolites ITQ-2 (Sext = 670 m2 g−1, cacid sites = 47 µmol g−1), MCM-56 (Sext = 210 m2 g−1, cacid sites = 123 µmol g−1), and UZM-8 (Sext = 310 m2 g−1, cacid sites = 151 µmol g−1) in isopropylation of benzene revealed the highest yield of cumene over UZM-8 material possessing the highest concentration of acid sites and moderately developed surface. It is clear that very tiny details of the synthesis procedures of layered MWW type materials are responsible for differences in catalytic performance. Thus, synthesis protocols offer a large space for further improvements in terms of external surface areas and accessible acid site concentrations. At the same time, all layered MWW zeolites outperformed their 3D counterpart (MCM-22) with respect to both conversion and selectivity.[219,290] The presence of mesoporosity between the lamellar MFI nanosheets is behind the observed increase of indole conversion compared to 3D MFI zeolite (from 4 to 97%) and selectivity to 3-acetylindole (from 30 to 75%) in the indole acylation reaction.[291]\nCracking: The performance of multi- and unilamellar MFI nanolayers and conventional 3D MFI zeolite in catalytic cracking of polyethylene was compared by Choi et al.[216] The increasing conversion of polyethylene in the sequence 3D MFI (27% after 30 min), multilamellar 2D MFI (45%), and unilamellar 2D MFI (85%) was explained by increasing BET surface area in multilamellar (420, 520, and 710 m2 g−1 for 3D, multilamellar, and unilamellar MFI, respectively). However, the role of mesopore size and distribution for the transformation of bulky polyethylene molecules cannot be excluded. A larger pore diameter in unilamellar (≈15 nm) then in multilamellar (≈3.5 nm) zeolite may also contribute to the superior activity of unilamellar MFI zeolite.\nThe benefits of highly accessible acid centers of delaminated 2D MWW zeolite (ITQ-2, Si/Al = 50) in cracking of n-decane, 1,3-diisopropylbenzene and vacuum gasoil were demonstrated with respect to 3D MWW (MCM-22, Si/Al = 50) zeolite by Corma et al.[280] Showing similar activity in the cracking of n-decane, ITQ-2 exhibited higher selectivity to valuable hydrocarbons than MCM-22. Higher selectivity of ITQ-2 was related to shorter diffusion paths for the high molecular weight substances (desired liquid products) in the delaminated zeolite. The reaction rate constant for cracking of bulkier 1,3-diisopropylbenzene was 1.5–2 times higher in ITQ-2 than in MCM-22; however, the selectivity toward valuable gasoline and diesel was lower in ITQ-2.\nThe increasing total concentration of acid sites in 3D MWW (62 µmol g−1) zeolite resulted in higher conversion of relatively small alkane (n-decane) compared to ITQ-2 zeolite\n(44 µmol g−1), however, the performance of 3D MWW in gasoil cracking was worse.[292] Similarly, the activity of 3D FER zeolite (CBrønsted = 19 µmol g−1) in cracking of n-decane was shown to be comparable to that of 2D FER (ITQ-6, CBrønsted = 9 µmol g−1) containing a lower number of acid sites: rate constants k = 2.5 × 10−3 and 2.1 × 10−3 s−1 for 3D and 2D FER, respectively. However, ITQ-6 exhibits much higher activity in cracking of bulky 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (k = 1.4 × 10−1 s−1) compared to 3D FER (k = 3.5 × 10−2 s−1) and this can be explained by the enhanced accessibility of acid sites in layered FER. While there are about 90% of acid sites at the external surface of ITQ-6, less than 5% of acid sites are on external surface of 3D zeolite, as shown by FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules.[293]\nMethanol to Hydrocarbons: An unprecedented stability of MFI nanosheets in industrially important methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) process was reported by Choi et al.[216]: while the significant drop in methanol conversion was observed already in 4 d for 3D MFI, the extended lifetime of 15 d was found for the nanosheets (Figure 14). Such alteration in the stability of the catalysts was explained by the differences in the coke formation. Micropores of 3D MFI became blocked already at low coking levels, while coke deposited on the external surface of 2D MFI did not substantially obstruct diffusion of reagents. A higher activity of 2D versus 3D MFI in MTH process was also demonstrated by Zhu et al. (TON = 7.5 × 103 to 1 × 104 and 3 × 103 for 2D and 3D MFI, respectively).[294] In addition, 2D MFI showed a 2–7 time higher propylene-to-ethylene ratio in the products (C3= /C2= = 3.7–13.9 and 1.8 for 2D and 3D MFI, respectively) at comparable yields and composition of C4 and C5+ fractions. Thus, appropriate selectivity as well as high activity and stability indicates that 2D zeolites are promising catalysts for MTH processes.\nCondensation reactions: The large external surfaces of lamellar zeolites are particularly advantageous for condensation reactions involving bulky reagents. Despite containing less Al, both multilamellar (48% conversion) and unilamellar (76%) MFI zeolites were more active in comparison with 3D MFI (16%) in Claisen–Schmidt condensation.[216] Facile cyclization on the surface of lamellar zeolites also resulted in improved selectivity for flavanone (62–64%) compared to 3D (50%) MFI. The layered MFI zeolite with 1.5 nm thick nanosheets showed a higher activity in aldol condensation of benzaldehyde and heptanal compared either to 3D MFI or mesoporous Al-MCM-41 catalysts (85, 9, and <5% conversion, respectively).[295] These results were related to a higher concentration of surface acid sites accessible for bulky reagents in 2D versus 3D zeolites and to the higher strength of acid sites in 2D MFI than in Al-MCM-41.[296,297]\nThe beneficial catalytic performance of the MFI nanosheets compared to 3D MFI and Al-MCM-41 was also observed for the condensation reaction yielding vitamin E.[291] While negligible yields of products were achieved with 3D MFI and Al-MCM-41 (1–4%), the MFI nanosheets possessing sufficiently strong acid centers accessible to reactants showed 75–89% conversion with reasonable selectivity to vitamin E (74–86%).\nThe catalytic activity of 2D MFI zeolites in annulation of phenols with methylbutenol was compared with that of conventional catalysts having micrometer-sized crystals—commercial medium-pore MFI, large-pore BEA, and ultrastable\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (26 of 33)\nmicro–mesoporous FAU zeolite (USY). A set of 2D catalysts under investigation included mesostructured MFI nanolayers with the same chemical composition, micropore sizes, and the narrow mesopore size distribution. Layered zeolites differed only in the thickness of crystalline sheets. The yield of targeted chromane increased with a micropore diameter of 3D zeolite (MFI < BEA < USY) and with the decreasing thickness of crystalline layers in 2D MFI. While investigated 2D zeolites had lower concentration of acid sites than 3D ones, 2D zeolites showed a higher activity. This result was related to the welldeveloped mesopore structure and large external surface area of layered zeolites which facilitates diffusion of reactants and products. The advantageous catalytic behavior of 2D catalysts over bulk zeolites became more prominent when using bulkier 2-naphthol as a substrate. The layered catalysts surpass not only medium-pore MFI and large-pore zeolite BEA, but also micro– mesoporous USY zeolite, which was explained by an optimal size of mesopores within 2D catalysts that is sufficient for the activation of the substrate and for the formation of bulky intermediates.[298]\nCatalytic activity of BA sites located on internal and external surfaces of H-ZSM-5 was investigated computationally for the Beckmann rearrangement reaction.[299] We can compare the results obtained for external and internal surfaces to get insight into the differences in catalytic activities of 3D and 2D H-ZSM-5. For smaller reactants (acetoxime), the reaction preferentially proceeds on internal surface BA sites at both 300 and 598 K. On the contrary, for larger reactants (cyclohexanone oxime) the reaction proceeds exclusively on the internal surface BA site at 300 K while the BA site on the external surface dominated the reaction at 598 K."

      "text" : "Ti- and Sn-containing 2D zeolites were shown to be sustainable catalysts for Red-Ox reactions, e.g., epoxidation of\nolefins,[300] Baeyer–Villiger reaction,[301] oxidation of benzene with nitrous oxide,[302] hydroxylation of phenol,[303] and Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction.[304] In most cases, layered zeolites exhibited improved catalytic activities in transformation of bulky molecules compared to ordered mesoporous materials and conventional 3D zeolites.[305] Layered Ti-substituted MEL zeolite showed a higher activity in comparison to 3D Ti-MEL in the oxidation of phenol (TOF = 25.2 and 15.6 h−1 for 2D and 3D MEL, respectively) and epoxidation of cyclohexene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TOF = 37.7 and 19.3 h−1 for 2D and 3D MEL, respectively).[303] Similarly, Ti-ITQ-6 showed higher activity in the oxidation of hexene with hydrogen peroxide than the 3D Ti-FER counterpart (TON = 23 and 6 for Ti-ITQ-6 and Ti-FER, respectively).[306] Self-pillared Sn-containing 2D MFI zeolite showed a remarkably higher yield of fructose (65%) in glucose isomerization than 3D Sn-BEA zeolite and Sn-MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve (<32%). The result was related to the higher accessibility of acid sites in the pillared 2D zeolite. Verheyen et al.[306] considered the transition state selectivity in 2D MFI zeolite based on the absence of ethyl- and propylbranched isomers among the products of n-decane isomerization. Slightly lower yields of 2,7-dimethyloctane found over 2D MFI (13–16% and 20% for 2D and 3D MFI, respectively) were explained by sensitivity of the shape selectivity effect on the diffusion path, which was lower in 2D MFI.\nFunctionalization of 2D zeolites with metal nanoparticles enlarged a set of reactions efficiently catalyzed by layered zeolites. Catalytic performance of 2D MFI functionalized with Pt nanoparticles was compared to that of Pt-containing 3D MFI and BEA zeolites in n-heptane hydroisomerization.[300] Negligible differences in conversion values in n-heptane transformation observed for 2D and 3D zeolites revealed that the reaction was not diffusion controlled. However, selectivity to i-C7 increased continuously from 26.2% to 58.7% with the decreasing thickness of MFI nanolayers from 300 to 2 nm and was explained by suppression of consecutive cracking of branched C7 isomers. Complementary results have been\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (27 of 33)\nobtained by Zhu et al., who also observed significantly higher selectivity of Pt-modified MFI nanosheets in comparison to bulk MFI zeolite (90–95 vs 56% for 2D and 3D MFI, respectively) at comparable conversion of n-heptane in hydroisomerization reaction.[294]\nMartinez and Prieto found that better dispersion of Co nanoparticles reached during functionalization of ITQ-2 layers (the size of Co nanoparticles was in the range 5–11 nm) resulted in a significantly higher yield for Co supported on ITQ-2 versus Co/silica gel in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (14–53 × 10−3 vs 3.3 × 10−3 molCO gCo−1 h−1 for Co/ITQ-2 and Co/silica gel, respectively).[307] Both Co/ITQ-2 and Co/ITQ-6, characterized by excellent reducibility of Co nanoparticles, showed higher selectivity to C5+ products compared to Co/Silica gel and Co/MCM-41 (72–78% for ITQ materials vs 45–65% of C5+ selectivity for noncrystalline silica materials). A 70% increase in activity of Co/ITQ-6 was explained by the smaller average size of Co nanoparticles in ITQ-6 (9.3 nm) vs ITQ-2 (11.7 nm).[308] However, both activity and selectivity obtained for Co-supported 2D zeolites in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis were lower than the values reported in the literature for other Cosupported catalysts.[309]\nMartinez et al. compared Mo-modified layered ITQ-2 and 3D MWW catalysts in methane dehydroaromatization.[310] Both catalysts yielded ethane/ethylene, benzene, toluene, and naphthalene as the main products. Mo/ITQ-2 showed lower selectivity to monocyclic aromatics than Mo/MWW (62% vs 65% selectivity to benzene), which was the lowest shape selectivity in layered zeolites. A careful dealumination of the external surface of ITQ-2 with oxalic acid led to an increase of benzene selectivity from 62 to 75% on the expense of naphthalene (selectivity decreased from 28 to 14%).\nWu et al.[311] designed hierarchical micro–mesoporous Momodified lamellar MFI zeolites with remarkable selectivity for methane dehydroaromatization; a 95% selectivity to monocyclic aromatic was observed for 2D Mo/MFI with the optimized ratio of micro- and mesopores. However, overcoming the current conversion limitation of the discussed Mo-supported 2D zeolites (below 5%) remains a challenge."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions and Perspectives",
      "text" : "2D oxide nanomaterials constitute a broad range of systems, with a wide array of current and potential applications, particularly in the field of renewable energy. It is important to further explore the peculiar properties of 2D oxides since they have been shown to exhibit superior performance in a number of applications. However, the industrial use of 2D oxides is currently very limited. A major challenge remains the transformation of 2D oxides into stable 3D hierarchical materials that can be upscaled and used industrially.\nIt is important to also remark that other types of oxide nanostructures relevant for catalysis (including for example, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, and thus to design improved electrodes[38]) are present in literature, for example nanowires, branched nanostructured films, and networks of nanoparticles. By controlling the nanostructure it is possible to obtain properties different from those of small 3D-type nanoparticles.[38,64a,c]\nThis is the common aspect joining the materials discussed here (2D/layered oxides) and these other types of nanostructures although present knowledge still does not allow for the prediction of when and why a specific nanostructure could be preferable.\nDespite the many similarities in structure, composition, synthetic methods, and uses, the current literature on layered oxides is diverse and disconnected. In this review, we summarize the recent developments in all important 2D oxide systems: i) supported ultrathin oxide films, ii) layered clays, iii) double hydroxides, iv) layered perovskites, and v) 2D zeolites. Each of the five types of layered oxides discussed herein is traditionally viewed as individual research fields. Particular attention is paid here to the underlying similarities and differences between the various materials, and the subsequent challenges faced by each research field. As remarked in Section 1.4 and through the text, there is, however, an important difference between 2D-type zeolites on one side and the other 2D/layered oxides discussed on the other side. This is related to the different degree of flexibility, and aspects such as nonstoichiometry, surface relaxation, phonons and lattice dynamics, and charge distribution among other features. Combining these two broad classes of materials provides a possibility to better understand when and why these different characteristics could be exploited. The present lack of a clear scientific rationale across the literature on how to exploit such characteristics represents the challenge for a knowledgebased design of novel catalytic materials.\nThere are many areas in which a common view could open new possibilities. For example, one of the major recent advances in zeolites is the possibility to manipulate 2D zeolites, organize them, and even synthetize new 3D zeolites. It has been shown that 2D zeolites can be viewed as building blocks to be used in the preparation of various 3D materials, e.g., hybrid inorganic–organic structures, where 2D zeolites are held together via organic linkers. Translating these concepts to other types of layered oxides, i.e., developing ways to manipulate 2D building blocks to create new materials or nanoarchitectures to improve performance, is one of the most exciting concepts to be developed.[16]\nFor catalytic applications, several of the discussed materials offer somewhat unique possibilities to develop multifunctional catalysts that allow for one-pot, complex multistage reactions. This has been clearly demonstrated for layered clays and hydrotalcites. On the contrary, the development of truly multifunctional catalysts is at a very early stage in the case of 2D zeolites. It follows from such examples that it is important and potentially beneficial to overlap the knowledge in individual 2D oxides fields and that it will lead to new potential applications. Specific attention is also devoted to the bridge between experimental and theoretical investigation of 2D oxides. This cooperation has often led to deeper insight and understanding of the physical origin of chemical properties in layered oxides.\nThe potential of layered oxides toward future applications is critically evaluated, especially in the areas of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, biomass conversion, and fine chemical synthesis. The corresponding novel 3D materials, either inorganic or hybrid inorganic/organic, which can be obtained via sophisticated engineering of 2D oxides, are also explored. We have introduced here that the possibility to develop functional\nAdv. Mater. 2019, 31, 1801712\n© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1801712 (28 of 33)\ntailored nanostructure with specific synergies between active catalytic functionalities may often be an important aspect, in addition to the commonly discussed aspects of diffusion and reactant accessibility.[16b] The general issue, in fact, is to understand how a specific functional nanoarchitecture is required to maximize the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, the question is how to use nanostructure characteristics and layer-specific properties to create and maximize this catalytic nanoarchitecture in addition to the other properties necessary for catalytic behavior, such as stability to cycling, transport properties, and selectivity. While great progress has been made on these aspects, a gap still exists between model catalysts, where these aspects are better understood, and practical catalysts. Understanding between the differences between bulk- and 2D-type materials could thus be a way toward bridging this gap in catalysis by oxides.[312]\nIt should be again finally remarked that the application of these novel layered oxides is currently more phenomenological than design-based oxides, and that the advanced knowledge available today in the tailored synthesis of materials is still not yet fully exploited in terms of catalyst design. Such knowledgebased design of 2D-type materials for catalytic applications is certainly the interesting challenge for the near future."

Despite the many similarities in structure, composition, and synthetic methods and uses, the current literature on layered oxides is diverse and disconnected. A number of reviews can be found in the literature, but they are mostly focused on one of the particular subclasses of 2D oxides. This review attempts to bridge the knowledge gap between individual layered oxide types by summarizing recent developments in all important 2D oxide systems including supported ultrathin oxide films, layered clays and double hydroxides, layered perov­ skites, and novel 2D­zeolite­based materials. Particular attention is paid to the underlying similarities and differences between the various materials, and the subsequent challenges faced by each research community. The potential of layered oxides toward future applications is critically evaluated, especially in the areas of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, biomass conversion, and fine chemical synthesis. Attention is also paid to corresponding novel 3D mate­ rials that can be obtained via sophisticated engineering of 2D oxides. Two­Dimensional Oxide Systems",
