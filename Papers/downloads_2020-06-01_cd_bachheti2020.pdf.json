Research on nanoparticles (NPs) has paved the way for manufacturing of numerous new and applicable materials on the nanoscale level. As described in various studies, nanomaterials (NMs) with nanoscale dimension exhibited distinctive properties in comparison to their bulk counterparts (Vadlapudi and Kaladhar, 2014; Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a; Fawcett et al., 2017; Rafique et al., 2017). As NPs have higher surface area, their electrical, magnetic, optical, physical, and chemical properties can be manipulated for different benefits (Velmurugan et al., 2014; Saratale et al., 2018; Husen and Iqbal, 2019a). At present, the fabrication of NPs and/or NMs having varied size, shape, composition, and structure is crucial area of research in nanobiotechnology (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014b,c; Husen and Iqbal, 2019b).\nNPs synthesis through top-down and bottom-up processes are already depicted (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a; Husen and Iqbal, 2019a). These processes comprise either physical, chemical, or biological methods of synthesis of NPs. Recently, the interest of many researchers shifted to biological methods of synthesis of NPs, and this synthesis technique is appearing as an interesting branch in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology (Husen and Iqbal, 2019b). It has been suggested that the green technology or biological routes has appeared as a major tool of NPs fabrication with acceptable potential properties and helpful to overcome the drawback and limitations of chemical and physical synthesis (Husen and Iqbal, 2019a). As described by Siddiqi and Husen (2016, 2017a) and Siddiqi et al. (2018a) green synthesized NPs are known to be less toxic, require reasonable equipment to produce and contained less toxic chemicals, and they are considered environmentally friendly when compared to physical or chemical methods. Biological synthesis involves the use of bacteria, fungi, algae, and different parts of plants for synthesis of NPs, but synthesis of NPs from this plant/plant part extract is becoming more popular (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a; Siddiqi et al., 2018a). Use of plant extracts also reduces the cost of microorganism’s isolation and their culture media, which enhance the cost competitive feasibility over NPs synthesis by microorganisms (Siddiqi et al., 2018a).\nRecently, numerous researchers have fabricated NPs by utilizing every parts of plants, for instance from leaf (Siddiqi et al., 2018d; Khan et al., 2019), latex (Arsalani et al., 2018; Arsalani et al., 2019), seeds (Radini et al., 2018; Hussein et al., 2018), flowers (Johnson et al., 2018; Dogru et al., 2017; Murugan and Muniyappan, 2018), fruits (Brajesh et al., 2017; Lakshmanan et al., 2018), peel (Vinay et al., 2018; Luque et al., 2018), stem (Sasikala et al., 2015; Azad and Banerjee, 2014), bark (Rao and Rao, 2016; Das and Smita, 2018), pulp (Kumar et al., 2016; Pushkar and Sevak, 2018), and root (Vijayaa et al., 2017; Shaikh et al., 2019). Among these, plant roots can be considered as one of the important parts for NMs fabrication since it contains several minerals and food reserves. They also possess phenolics, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, proteins, enzymes,\n136 CHAPTER 6 Root-based fabrication of metal/metal-oxide nanomaterials\ncarbohydrates, and other organic compounds. These metabolites play a key role in reducing metal ions into desired NPs and also act as capping and stabilizing agents. This chapter presents an overview of (1) the recent techniques of plant root based fabrication of metal and/or metal-oxide NPs; (2) their characterization by UV vis spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM), among others; and (3) their application in some cutting-edge areas."

      "text" : "It has been noticed that the metal NPs possess unique physical and chemical properties, and thus find various application in innumerable sectors. In general, entire plant and their parts contained different kinds of primary and secondary metabolites which are used by them for their growth, development, as well as defense purpose. They are rich in such phytoconstituents; and thus, researchers are utilizing every parts of plant for the NPs fabrication. Plant roots are dominant parts of plants that has been potentially used for different application across the world, as they are known to be rich sources of various bioactive constituents. Plants roots are also used in pharmaceutical industries as raw materials for various kinds of drug preparation (Nautiyal et al., 2002). They contain carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, fats, and oils, and they also possess different phytoconstituents (phenolics, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, phenols, terpenoids, resins, steroids, tannins, etc.). These phytoconstituents play a vital role in antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiseptic, and antimicrobial properties of the corresponding plant root and are able to participate in reducing, stabilizing, and capping of metal or metal oxide or metal-oxide NPs\nIn an experiment, Arokiyaraj et al. (2017) used root extract of Rheum palmatum which possesses phenolic compounds and anthraquinone and plays roles in reducing, stabilizing, and capping of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). The size and shape as well as stability of NPs can also be controlled by reduction mechanism during their synthesis (Mohamad et al., 2014). Pugazhendhi et al. (2015) fabricated Ag-NPs using the root extracts of Alpinia calcarata as a reducing agent as well as stabilizing agent. UV vis spectroscopy studies have shown a characteristic plasmon absorption bands at wavelengths ranging from 350 to 690 nm depending on the particle size and dipole/multipole resonance. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) studies have shown quasi-spherical shaped (size varies from 5 to 15 nm) Ag-NPs formation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies suggest the presence of flavonoid and other phenolics in the extract were responsible for the reduction of metal ions and formation of Ag-NPs. Dried root material of Nepeta leucophylla was used for fabrication of Ag-NPs (Singh and Dhaliwal, 2019). Ag-NPs fabrication was carried out by adding 10 mL of the extract solution (20 mg mL21) to 40 mL of aqueous\n1376.2 Plant roots and metal nanoparticles fabrication\nsilver nitrate (AgNO3) solution which had 1 mM concentration. They claimed that the root extract was rich in polyphenolic and flavonoid contents. The reduction of Ag salt in the used extract was noticed at various temperatures and the reaction mixture becomes brown and showed representative absorbance spectra of Ag-NPs. They examined various Ag-NPs fabrication factors for instance root extract concentration, incubation time, temperature, and pH. Obtained Ag-NPs were characterized by UV vis spectroscopy, FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), TEM, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). It was observed that the fabrication processes of Ag-NPs were increased with time, temperature, and at the basic pH. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band was detected at 410 nm in the UV vis spectroscopy. By using FTIR studies, authors have suggested that the root extract contained phenol which was responsible for reduction, and proteins facilitate capping that inhibit agglomeration. Further, TEM studies showed that Ag-NPs were spherical in shape. Benakashani et al. (2017) investigated Ag-NPs fabrication process from Lepidium draba root extract and were characterized by using FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TEM techniques. SEM studies have shown the fabrication Ag-NPs dispersed within the size range of 20 80 nm. XRD studies revealed that the average crystalline size of fabricated Ag-NPs was 24 nm in size. Authors have suggested that by increasing the root extract concentrations, smaller size Ag-NPs can be produced.\nKumar et al. (2011) utilized Zingiber officinale extract for synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) of size 5 15 nm. The extract was rich in phytoconstituents such as alkaloids, and flavonoids, which make extract to act as reducing and stabilizing agent. Pardha-Saradhi et al. (2014) used 16 different plant species roots for fabrication of Au-NPs. Their root system was exposed to various doses (e.g., 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM) of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (HAuCl4.3H2O). They were incubated at room temperature (25 C 6 2 C) with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle with a light intensity of 120 mmol m22 s21 photon flux density. Thereafter, Au-NPs were characterized using UV vis, TEM, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The purple/golden colloidal solutions were noticed, and absorption peaks were recorded between 520 and 580 nm, which are known to arise due to the SPR in Au-NPs (Husen, 2017; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a). In this investigation, the absorption peak intensity was increased with an increase in dose of HAuCl4. Moreover, the absorption peak intensity was varied among the tested plant species, which have shown the reducing strength of their root system. TEM studies have shown particle size of 5 100 nm. Fresh roots of Coleus forskohlii was used for the fabrication of Ag- and AuNPs (Dhayalan et al., 2018), the synthesis of gold and silver NPs. Their characterization has shown that they were crystalline, uniform, spherical in shape, and the average particle size was about 20 50 nm. In an experiment, the dry burdock roots of Arctium lappa were finely grinded and powder was used for the fabrication of Ag- and Au-NPs (Nguyen et al., 2018). Root extract was added into the respective solution of AgNO3 or HAuCl4 3H2O. The NPs were characterized\n138 CHAPTER 6 Root-based fabrication of metal/metal-oxide nanomaterials\nusing UV vis spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, energy-dispersive X-ray, thermogravimetry, and various thermal analyses. Results have shown that Ag- and Au-NPs were roughly spherical (average diameter of 21.3 nm) and multi shaped (average size of 24.7 nm), respectively\nIn a recent publication, Azadi et al. (2018) fabricated magnetite NPs from the root extract of Persicaria bistorta and optimized the fabrication process. The optimized parameters for the synthesis of nano-magnetite are temperature (70 C) of FeCl2 (0.15 M) and pH (11). The particle size was 13 nm. Sreekanth et al. (2018) used ultra-sonication method for the synthesis of quasi-spherical Ag-NPs from aqueous Panax ginseng roots extract and characterized using UV vis spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, EDX, and HR-TEM. Nasiri et al. (2018) fabricated Ag-NPs using both aqueous leaf and root extracts of Ferula persica. They were characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, and TEM. Interestingly, authors have reported that in comparison to the chemically fabricated Ag-NPs, the biogenic fabrication of Ag-NPs showed less phytotoxicic effects on the germination percentage followed by shoot and root elongation of Matricaria chamomilla and Ocimum basilicum. Berberis vulgaris leaf and root aqueous extracts were utilized for the synthesis of Ag-NPs by Behravan et al. (2019) and effect of different parameters such as B. vulgaris aqueous extract (3, 5, 10, 15, 30 mL), AgNO3 concentration (0.5, 1, 3, 10 mM), and contact time were also studied. The optimum conditions for the synthesis of Ag-NPs were 3 mM of AgNO3, 5 mL of aqueous extract, room temperature, and time of 1 h. The synthesized Ag-NPs were characterized by UV vis, XRD, TEM, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Zeta potential, which shows that Ag-NPs are spherical in shape and vary in size from 30 to 70 nm. Further details of metal NPs fabrication, their characterization techniques with their shape, size, and significance are presented in Table 6.1."

They possess unique compositions, morphologies, structures, and physiochemical properties (Fawcett et al., 2017). These unique properties of metal-oxide NPs allow them to involve in various industrial applications such as catalytic processes, electronics, sensors, magnetic storage media, solar energy conversion process, and so on. Different phytoconstituents of roots have important role in reducing of metal-oxide precursors to desired NPs fabrication, and these constituents also involve in stabilization of the resulting nanoproducts (Husen 2019a,b; Joshi et al., 2019). For instance, Guin et al.

Titanium dioxide NPs were fabricated from Euphorbia heteradena Jaub root extract by Nasrollahzadeh and Sajadi (2015b). The authors have reported that hydroxyl functional group of phenolics in root extract involves in reducing the titanyl hydroxide [TiO(OH)2] to titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs and act as capping/stabilizing agents. Nagajyothi et al. (2015) used dried root extracts of Polygala tenuifolia for fabrication of zinc oxide NPs. They were characterized by UV vis spectroscopy, FTIR, TGA, TEM, SEM, and EDX. UV vis spectroscopy showed SPR of about 360 nm. They were crystalline in nature and XRD studies revealed the formation of rutile phase. In another experiment, Anand Raj and Jayalakshmy (2015) used aqueous root extracts of Z. officinale and fabricated zinc oxide NPs. They were spherical in shape with average particle size of 30 50 nm. In a recent experiment, Vijay Kumar et al. (2018) fabricated iron oxide NPs by means of Asparagus racemosus root extracts. In addition to this, root extracts of Euphorbia condylocarpa was used as a reducing and stabilizing agent to produce palladium-coated magnetite (Pd/Fe3O4) NPs (Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2015). Titanium dioxide NPs were synthesized from the rhizospheric roots of sorghum with spherical shape (12 15 nm). The phenolic/flavonoid compounds present in the root extract act as reducing and stabilizing agents (Fulekar et al., 2018). Niraimathee et al. (2016) fabricated magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs by employing Mimosa pudica root extracts which are roughly spherical in shape and the particle size ranges between 60 and 80 nm. Silver oxide NPs (Ag2O-NPs) were fabricated from Ficus benghalensis root extract by Manikandan et al. (2017). They were characterized by using UV vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, HR-TEM, and SAED, which showed spherical silver oxide of 42.7 nm in size. The authors have claimed that the root extract concentration, pH (9), and time have a remarkable effect on the Ag2O-NPs fabrication. Further details of metal-oxide NPs fabrication, their characterization techniques with their shape, size, and significance are presented in Table 6.2."

These hydroxyl groups undergo deprotonation and electron generation. Protons react with two nitrate ions forming nitric acid, which is consistent with the acidification of the synthesis and two silver ions are reduced to metallic silver by electronic transfer, while the aromatic ring is reconfigured to the stable quinone form (Rodrı́guez-León et al., 2018)."

      "heading" : "6.5.1 Antimicrobial activities",
      "text" : "Several reports are available and suggests the antimicrobial activities of metal/ metal-oxide NPs as fabricated from the various plant root extracts (Table 6.1 and 6.2). The size and shape of the NPs as well as the material used for their fabrication are key factors in determining the antimicrobial effectiveness of NPs (Singh et al., 2018; Sorbiun et al., 2018). The huge surface area of NPs allows better contact with the cell membrane of microorganism. Metal and/or metal-oxide NPs suppress the growth of microorganisms by releasing the metal ion that interfere with the process of DNA replication, cell membrane formation, cell division, and so on of certain microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and virus (Sorbiun et al., 2018; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017b; Siddiqi et al., 2018a). Of the most commonly known metal NPs, those produced using Ag and Au metals cover the highest portion because of their highest effectivity against different microbes. Furthermore, Ag-NPs are most commonly known NPs, which have been frequently produced by various researchers because of its highest capability of fighting against different pathogenic bacteria and fungus (Rafique et al., 2017; Siddiqi et al., 2018a). Antimicrobial study of silver NPs prepared using B. vulgaris leaf and root aqueous extracts was performed by Behravan et al.

The antibacterial effect of Ag-NPs on E. coli (gram-negative bacteria) was more effective in comparison to S. aureus (gram-positive bacteria). In another experiment, Pugazhendhi et al. (2015) fabricated spherical-shaped Ag-NPs using the root extracts of A. calcarata as reducing agent and studied its antibacterial activities by resazurin-dye reduction assay method. Synthesized Ag-NPs s from root extracts of A. calcarata were effective against Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, Bacillus cereus, and S. aureus. Mehmood et al. (2016) biogenically synthesized Ag-NPs using root bark extract of easily available plant Berberis lyceum. They studied the antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and the result revealed that Ag-NPs showed the highest activity against Klebseilla pneumoniae and lowest activity against S. aureus. Beside this, the minimum inhibitory concentration represents that the Ag-NPs with 10 μg mL21 concentration showed the highest activity, while 2.5 μg mL21 Ag-NPs showed least inhibitory activity. The hexagonal and spherical-shaped Ag-NPs were synthesized using root extracts of R. palmatum and showed antibacterial activities against human pathogenic bacteria, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Arokiyaraja et al., 2017). Wang et al. (2016) prepared Ag-NPs from Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) root extract and tested for antimicrobial activity against four clinical bacteria (E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa) and four aquatic pathogens (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Aeromonas punctata). The range of zone of inhibition for eight photogenic bacteria (clinical and aquatic pathogens) was 8.2 13.6 mm. The other work carried out by Rao et al. (2016) revealed that the green synthesized Ag-NPs using methanolic root extract of Diospyros paniculata are effective not only against gram-positive bacteria\n1536.5 Applications of root-based metal and/or metal-oxide nanoparticles\n(Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. aureus) but also against gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and P. aeruginosa). Moreover, they are also capable to inhibit the growth of different fungal species, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium notatum, and Candida albicans. Rodrı́guez-León et al. (2018) reported antibacterial and antifungal effectivities of green synthesized Ag-NPs using R. hymenosepalus root extract. The synthesized Ag-NPs showed significant inhibitory effects on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. According to Rajagopal et al. (2015), the phytoconstituents available in Catharanthus roseus root such as aliphatic amine and alkenes are able to reduce the Ag precursor to NPs, and the resulting Ag-NPs showed effective larvicidal activities against larvae of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. More interestingly, nickel NPs having antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria were synthesized biologically using the root extracts of D. gangeticum (Sudhasree et al., 2015).\nIn another work, Guin et al. (2015) fabricated copper oxides (CuO and Cu2O) NPs biologically using aqueous root extract of D. gangeticum and evaluated their antibacterial activity by comparing with that of ciprofloxacin, the positive control. The produced copper oxide NPs were effective against B. subtilis, S. aureus, and E. coli. According to Jamuna et al. (2014), TiO2-NPs fabricated using aqueous root extract of D. gangeticum showed better antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (2413), S. aureus MTCC (3160), S. aureus E1 (9886), and E. coli in comparison to titanium tetraisopropoxide [Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4] precursor which was considered as control. Silver oxide NPs were synthesized from F. benghalensis prop root extract by Manikandan et al. (2017). These particles showed remarkable antibacterial activities against the two-dental bacteria Streptococcus mutans (KACC 16833) and Lactobacilli sp. (KACC 12419). Authors have suggested that the fabricated NPs can be useful in tooth paste as a germicidal agent after extensive investigation with animal models."

Plant root extract contained free radical scavenging molecules such as phenols, flavonoids, vitamins, and terpenoids; and thus, they serve as antioxidant agents (Singh and Dhaliwal, 2019). Singh and Dhaliwal (2019) synthesized Ag-NPs from N. leucophylla root extract and evaluated for its antioxidant activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. The DPPH assay indicated that the synthesized Ag-NPs showed higher antioxidant activity (79.41 6 0.004 in 250 μg mL21) than N. leucophylla root extract (68.29 6 0.004 in 250 μg mL21). Ponvel et al. (2015) tested the antioxidant activity of Ag-NPs produced from root extract of medicinal plant Justicia adhatoda by DPPH method and the results confirmed the antioxidant activity of synthesized Ag-NPs.

The test was carried out by three different methods, DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide assay. All the radical scavenging assay results revealed that the phytoconstituents in the root extract of H. isora plays a remarkable role in reducing the Ag metal to Ag-NPs which possess higher antioxidant activity. Nickel NPs obtained biologically using root extract of D. gangeticum showed significantly higher antioxidant activity when tested using DPPH radical scavenging assay as compared to its precursor (NiCl2) but lower than the aqueous D. gangeticum root extract (Sudhasree et al., 2015). Beside this, the antioxidant effectivity of copper oxides NPs was also critically determined through DPPH free radical and reducing power assay and showed significant antioxidant response (Guin et al., 2015). Nagajyothi et al. (2015) tested the antioxidant activity (DPPH method) and antiinflammatory activity (in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages) of green synthesized zinc oxide NPs prepared from root extract of P. tenuifolia. The result indicated that zinc oxide NPs showed moderate antioxidant activity, while noticeable antiinflammatory activity was recorded in dose-dependent manner. Lovoa trichilioı̈des root was also used for green synthesis of Ag-NPs (Sidjui et al., 2016). The fabricated Ag-NPs were tested for antioxidant activity by DPPH method. In this experiment, the antioxidant activity (in vitro) was found to be biphasic response and inhibitory activity was observed between 100 and 25 μg mL21."

This is one of the efficient routes to prevent environmental pollution by removing organic dyes from industrial effluents through catalytic photodegradation. In another study, Fulekar et al. (2018) reported the catalytic activity of titanium dioxide (TiO2) synthesized using microbes and rhizospheric roots of sorghum. The result revealed that the TiO2-NPs act as a photocatalyst and showed higher photodegradation activities of methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation, while MO dye solution alone did not exhibit such response. More than 99% degradation of MO dye was obtained in 120 min with root synthesized TiO2-NPs. Spherical-shaped Au-NPs were produced using root extracts of Dalbergia coromandeliana and used as nano-catalyst for degradation of methyl orange and Congo red dye (Umamaheswari et al., 2018).\nStan et al. (2015) fabricated ZnO-NPs from the root extracts of Allium sativum (garlic) and Allium cepa (onion) and used for photodegradation of methylene blue dye. Green synthesized Ag-NPs and Au-NPs from extract of burdock root (A. lappa) showed catalytic activities in the removal of industrial pollutants such as 4-nitrophenol, methyl orange, and rhodamine B in the presence of excess amount of NaBH4 (Nguyen et al., 2018). Thus from the abovementioned points, it is clear that root-based fabricated metal and/or metal-oxide NPs comprising different phytoconstituents can be widely used as a catalyst to carry out important reactions and significant in removal of various organic pollutants released from the industrial effluents."

For instance, Singh et al. (2016a) fabricated Ag- and Au-NPs using root extracts of medicinal plant Panax ginseng. Ag-NPs showed a maximum antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, followed by B. anthracis, B. cereus, E. coli, and V. parahaemolyticus; however, with Au-NPs no activity was noted at the same concentration. Ag-NPs synthesized using aqueous extract of A. calcarata root that have medicinal activities to cure bronchial catarrh, stomach complaints, disinfectant and cold, cough, chest complaints, and indigestion (Pugazhendhi et al., 2015). Au-NPs were synthesized using aqueous root extract of garlic (A. sativum) and investigated for some of its bio-medicinal applicability (Rastogi and Arunachalam, 2012). Cytotoxicity of synthesized NPs was evaluated. The result demonstrates that the Au-NPs prepared using garlic root extract are potentially suitable for NPs based diagnostic and drug delivery system because of their stability for long period. In other study, Niraimathee et al. (2016) fabricated magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs by employing M. pudica root extracts and studied its superparamagnetic behavior.

The cytotoxic activity (in vitro) of synthesized TiO2-NPs from R emodi root extract was evaluated against (HepG2) cancer cells by Sharma et al. (2018). IC50 was detected in about 400 μg mL21 concentration. Authors have claimed that the inhibitory effect of TiO2-NPs against liver cell lines (HepG2) was due to the capping synergy of bioactive anthraquinones with NPs. Alishah et al. (2017) biogenically generated CuO-NPs by employing starch, extracted from the root of Solanum tuberosum, and reported the cytotoxicity of the CuO-NPs (against MCF-7 breast) cancer cell lines. In another work, Suman et al. (2013) studied the cytotoxicity of Ag-NPs fabricated from the root extract of Morinda citrifolia against HeLa cell lines and reported their anticancer activities. The result suggests that the prepared Ag-NPs showed 60.6% reduction in HeLa cells when tested for LC50 value at different concentrations, and 100% of cell death was observed against HeLa cells at 100 μg. Therefore Ag-NPs prepared from root extract of M. citrifolia have shown remarkable potential in cancer cure and prevention.

In this procedure, harmful solvents are not used in comparison to those obtained from physical and chemical pathways. Moreover, plant-based NPs fabrication is considered as easy, highly efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly. Plant roots are composed of various bioactive constituents such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, carbohydrates, proteins, and other metabolites. These phytoconstituents involves in reducing, capping, and stabilizing activities of the NPs. These metal and metal-oxide NPs synthesized using bio-actives compounds of plant roots are applicable in different fields such as in medicine, catalysis, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiinflammatory activities, agricultural activities, and so on. It has been concluded that since various plant roots are rich in different phytoconstituents and are traditionally used as medicine in different parts of the world, thus employing them for synthesis of NPs paves the way for simple/inexpensive and more efficient green technologies, and find their application in innumerable sectors."
