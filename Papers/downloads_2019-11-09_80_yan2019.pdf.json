Traditional olution processes, such as drop-casting, spin-coating or inkjet rinting, are difficult to control their dewetting behaviors. As\nresult, randomly dispersive 1D assemblies/structures of funcional materials appear, indicating limited application due to heir overlapped/crosslinking status. Therefore, the challenge of\nanipulating the dewetting behavior in the solution processes is rerequisite [31–49].\nWettability control is a powerful tool to govern the dewetting f liquids upon the solid surfaces [50,51]. Lyophilic solid surfaces refer to spread the liquid while lyophobic counterparts commonly epel the liquid. At the molecular level, the top atomic/molecular ayer of the lyophilic areas attract the liquid molecules while those n the lyophobic regions will repel the liquid molecules to other laces. Accordingly, the dewetting of liquid can move from the yophobic (low-surface-free-energy) area towards the lyophilic high-surface-free-energy) region, allowing for the liquid to climb phill [52], directional condense [53], and on-demand transport n the microfluidics [54]. Besides the macroscopic motions, in\nsubstrate. (c) Schematic illustration of Fc and Fs inside one liquid bridge. (d) The n of water, such two forces are equal to each other. Reprinted from Ref. [55] with\nrecent decades, the control of wettability has been recognized as an effective route to dominate the liquid dewetting at the microscale [55]. When introducing regular lyophilic dots/stripes onto a lyophobic surface, highly ordered liquid bridges with several micrometers can appear. At the beginning, each liquid bridge was several micrometers in width and tens of micrometers in length. Due to the evaporation of volatile solvent, the width of each liquid bridge will shrink gradually. In this case, each liquid bridge can serve as a linear confined spacing to restrict the assembly of inside guests, leading to ordered 1D arrangement of functional materials. Most importantly, the patterning, including location, orientation and density, of microscale liquid bridges is tunable by a careful design of lyophilic/lyophobic domains, resulting in precisely positioning 1D assemblies. This wettabilitycontrolled liquid bridge induced assembly strategy can circumvent the positioning challenge of 1D assemblies in the solution process.\nIn this Review, recent progress in precisely positioning 1D patterning, from small molecules to macromolecules and nanomaterials, through a liquid bridge induced assembly (LBIA) strategy [7,55–79] will be briefly reviewed. First part introduces basic theories on the generation of wettability dominated liquid bridge arrays.

Finally, a rief conclusion and outlook will be provided.\nLiquid bridge induced assembly (LBIA) mechanism\nWhen a volatile liquid is dropped onto a solid surface, its three phase contact line (TCL) will shrink towards its geometric center driven by the evaporation. The dewetting process of the liquid upon a homogenous solid surface is continuous, however, will be interrupted by wettability-heterogeneous domains (Fig. 1a). Superhydrophobic (water contact angles > 150◦) pillarstructured substrates are the most used strategy to prepare\n16 C.

No matter consisting of oft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rubber [80–87] or rigid silicon rystalline [7,55–79], the basic mechanism of pillar-structured subtrates is based on the hydrophilic pillar tops collaborated with ydrophobic air pockets trapped in the pillar gaps (inset image of ig. 1a). Generally, the surfaces of micropillars are modified by a hin-layer of low-surface-free-energy molecules to resist the per-\neation of liquid. Even the pillar tops are liquid-resistant, they erve as the hydrophilic domains in the LBIA strategy since the air ockets trapped in the pillar gaps are more hydrophobic. When he TCL of liquids begin to move upon a pillar-structured subtrate, each pillar top works as the hydrophilic domain to firmly in the liquid. At the meanwhile, the air pockets trapped in the pilar gaps can serve as the hydrophobic domains to rupture the liquid lms. Therefore, microscale liquid bridge arrays appear connecting eighbouring micropillars (Fig. 1b).\nTwo competitive forces exist inside each microscale liquid ridge. One is capillary force, Fc, which is dominated by the surace tension and capillary pressure at the fluid/solid interface, and he other is structural cohesive force, Fs, which is the mechanial strength of liquid bridges (Fig. 1c). With the evaporation of ater, the narrowing of liquid bridges leads to decreased Fc and ncreased Fs (Fig. 1d). Finally, such two forces were comparable ith each other (Fc (0) is equal to Fs(0)). The liquid bridges connect eighbouring lyophilic domains, indicating the dewetting process f the liquid bridges will proceed in the width direction, rather than long the length direction. With the narrowing of liquid bridges, heir inside guests will be forced to pack in one direction, resultng in 1D assemblies of functional materials, known as the LBIA\nechanism. The location of liquid bridges highly depends on the geomery of micropillars [55]. A ẗip-induced effectc̈ommonly exists on\nrns.

By analyzing the forces locating in different positions, it is easy to find that the ratio of Fs/Fc increases more than 4 times from Position II to Position I (Fig. 2b). As a result, liquid bridges between the tips exhibit stronger structural force, indicating a more stable state for the generation of 1D assembly. The tip angles of spindle shaped micropillars also affect the positioning. 60◦-75◦ is optimized values for precise positioning of resulted 1D assemblies (Fig. 2c). Besides tip angles, the distance between the tips dramatically dominated the patterning, as well as positioning, of 1D assemblies, named as n̈earest bridging rule[̈77]. By fixing the vertical pillar gap at 10 m while changing the horizontal distance between the tips from 5 to 25 m, it can be clearly found that horizontal nanowires were gradually reduced, while vertical counterparts increased dramatically (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2e shows the relationship between (Fs)h/(Fs)v and tip distance (L). Larger tip distance indicates increased structural force (Fs) that will break the resulted 1D assemblies. Therefore, horizontal nanowire arrays will change to vertical ones following the increase of the tip distance. In summary, the 1D assemblies from the LBIA process prefer to bridge nearest micropillars.\nControllable patterning and structures of 1D assemblies\nTunable patterns\nThe patterning, including location, orientation and density, of 1D assemblies in the LBIA strategy highly depends on the generation of liquid bridges. By understanding above ẗip-induced effectänd n̈earest bridging ruleïn the LBIA process, a dynamic strategy was proposed to control the positioning of nanowires based on a stretchable pillar-structured PDMS substrate [77].

When the soft substrate was stretched in the vertical direcion, the distance of vertical pillar gap was larger than that in the orizontal direction. In this case, only one nanowire was fabricated, hereas none of wire existed to bridge the vertical micropillars. On he other hand, if the soft substrate was stretched in 45◦ or just one ide, the distance of pillar gap will be changed accordingly, leading o diverse wire patterns.\nBesides soft micropillars, the geometric shapes, as well as the ocations of hydrophilic domains, were tailored to effectively govrn the patterning of 1D assemblies. Taking the polyvinyl alcohol PVA) nanowire patterning as an example, a zigzag type patern appeared by carefully designing the location of micropillars\nFig. 4a,b) [55,58]. If the dewetting direction of liquid was 45◦ nclined towards square-shaped micropillars, the nanowires could recisely locate at the corners of each micropillar due to the hortest distance between the neighbouring hydrophilic domains\n) are corresponding SEM images of (a), (c), (e), (g), respectively.

However, the result might be different when mixing two-component building blocks, such as ḧardp̈olystyrene (PS) microspheres and s̈oftP̈VA molecules, into the liquid bridges (Fig. 5e) [75]. With the narrowing of the liquid bridges, the PS microspheres and PVA molecules were forced to align. Because the size of firm PS microspheres (hundreds of nanometers) was larger than the width of PVA wire (tens of nanometers), bead-shaped wires were generated accordingly (Fig. 5f). The PS microspheres served as the bead parts while the PVA wires bridged the neighbouring PS beads, leading to artificially spindle silks at the microscale. Besides bead-shaped nanowires, 1D binary superstructures, consisting of PS spheres within different sizes, have been reported by Song et al [88]. In this study, large PS spheres were mixed with small PS ones (the diameter of two species was around 6–8, see Fig. 5g). After undergoing the LBIA process, small PS spheres preferred to stay at the bottom sides of the larger counterparts, yielding 1D binary superstructures (Fig. 5h).\nCoaxial 1D microstructure, consisting of heterogeneous materials in its core and sheath parts, can be fabricated by a two-step LBIA process [61]. First, highly oriented calcein wire arrays were fabricated, and covered by a thin layer of fluoride molecules to prevent the damage from the second LBIA process. Then, a neilred-rich liquid was used to form the outside sheath parts, yielding calcein@nile-red coaxial wire arrays (Fig. 5i). From the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image shown in Fig. 5j, a clear coaxial structure can be found. Importantly, these two functional materials, selected in the core and sheath parts, can generate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) due to their overlapped energy bands. In this case, the coaxial wire arrays can serve as the chemical sensors to respond diverse metallic/organic compounds. Further-\n18 C.

[60] with permission from Na\nore, another coaxial 1D structure consisting of rigid inorganic core nd soft organic sheath was demonstrated [58]. 1D assemblies of ilver NPs in the core part transported electrons while PS was used o prevent the sulfuration from the atmosphere. Compared with are silver NP wires, the silver-NP@PS coaxial 1D structures showed\nstable electrical performance even after stored in one month. oukany’s group reported a one-step strategy to build coaxial 1D tructures based on the self-organization of polystyrenepolyethyene oxide block- copolymer (PS-b-PEO) micelles [89]. During the BIA process, rigid PS molecular segments self-assembled into the ore part, leaving the soft PEO segments as the sheaths.\nD assemblies of diverse material species\nThe liquid bridges in the LBIA strategy connect neighbouring yophilic domains, indicating the dewetting process of the liquid ridges will proceed in the width direction, rather than along the ength direction. With the narrowing of liquid bridges, their inside uests will be forced to pack in one direction, resulting in 1D assemlies of functional materials (Fig. 6a). Then, one question has been aised: what kinds of materials can be assembled in the LBIA stratgy? To address this point, three criteria have been proposed to\nmaterials, such as (q) graphene or (r) graphdiyne, and biomolecules, such as (s) rough the LBIA strategy. Reprinted from Ref. [55,64–68,70,74,76,86,87,97,98] with ublishing Group, Ref. [79] with permission from American Chemical Society.\nguide the selection of materials: (1) The liquid should be volatile. The evaporation of liquid is the driving force of dewetting, and the source of the liquid bridge generation. (2) The functional materials should homogenously disperse in the liquid no matter they are dissolved or in a suspended state. (3) The interaction among the functional materials should be large enough to hold their mechanical strength after the dewetting process.\nSmall molecules\nTaking the calcein molecules as an example, we exhibit their 1D assemblies through the LBIA strategy. Calcein is a kind of small molecules that owns four carboxyl groups at both its sides (Fig. 6b). The calcein molecules can completely dissolve (criteria (2)) in the water (criteria (1)), and formed considerable hydrogen bonds (criteria (3)) to link themselves after dewetting. By placing a calcein-rich drop upon the pillar-structured substrate, highly oriented calcein microwire arrays could be fabricated [68], which showed green fluorescence when exposed to a UV excitation. The interaction among the molecules is the key to build firm 1D assemblies. Other two molecules (fluorescein and 5-carboxyfluorescein) whose structures own the same middle part but fewer carboxyl\nC.

In 2015, Jiang and Su et al. utilized a top-lyophobic side-lyophilic grooved substrate to guide the 1D assemblies f 9,10- bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) small molecules Fig. 6c) [60]. Owing to its planar and benzene-ring-rich molecuar structure, the BPEA molecules firstly – stacked on the silicon ubstrate with (100) plane, then grew along the [010] direction, esulting in single-crystalline small molecular wires. Similar mechnism has been used to guide the generation of single-crystalline ,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS- pentacene, see ig. 6d) [65], 1,4-dimethoxy-2,5-di[4-(methylthio)styryl]benzene TDSB, see Fig. 6e) [74] and alkyl substituted core-tetrachlorinated erylene diimides (R-8ClPDIs, see Fig. 6f) microwire/belt arrays 79].\nacromolecules\nPoly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a kind of water-soluble polymer. hen a PVA-rich drop was slipped upon the pillar-structured ubstrate, highly ordered PVA nanowire arrays were achieved\nic illustrations of the cross-sectional parts according to (c), respectively. Reprinted\n(Fig. 6g) [55]. Free-standing PVA nanowires could be fabricated within 10 s. By using the similar approach, flexible deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double helix biomolecular wires can be arranged towards one direction with a width of tens of nanometers (Fig. 6s) [80–86,89–93]. Since the LBIA strategy provided linear confined spacing with a high length-width ratio, flexible DNA chains would undergo a coil-stretch transition [94,95]. Lee and Boukany et al. reported this visible DNA coil-stretch transition by using a micropatterned substrate [80,94,95]. Following the dewetting of the droplet, DNA chains insides liquid bridges would be stretched bridging neigoubouring micropillars. Besides flexible macromoleculs, rigid planar macromolecules, such as dithienylthieno[3,2-b] thiopheneN-alkyl diketopyrrolo-pyrrole (DTT-DPP, see Fig. 6h) [64] or poly [4-(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b’]dithiophen2-yl)-alt- [1,2,5] [3,4-c]pyridine] (PCDTPT, see Fig. 6i) [76], and polystyrene-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer (PS-PEO) (Fig. 6j) [87], can also be assembled towards one direction through the LBIA strategy. Since most functional polymers are insoluble in water, benzene derivative liquids were used in these studies.\n0D nanomaterials\nAbove-mentioned small molecules [60,65,68,74,79] or polymers [55,64,76,80–87,89–93] are completely dissolved in the\n20 C.

At the beginning, 0D nanomaterials could andomly move inside the liquid due to the Brownian motions. owever, their free motions were gradually restricted along with he narrowing of liquid bridges, yielding regular 1D assemblies. n these cases, the interaction among the particles is mostly govrned by the van de Waals force, rather than covalent/non-covalent hemical bonds.\nVery recently, this LBIA dominated 1D assembly of NPs was irectly observed by Mirsaidov et al. through an in-situ liquid-cell ransmission electron microscopy (LC-TEM) [96]. The experimental latform was schematically shown in Fig. 7a. Golden nanoparicles (GNPs) solution was sandwiched between two translucent iNx films. In particular, the bottom SiNx film was fabricated with icrochannel structure while the top one was flat (Fig. 7b). Based n this special cell design, the stepwise self-assembly dynamics f hydrophobic GNPs into 1D assembly can be directly observed Fig. 7c). First, a meniscus of water stripe formed between neighouring nanochannel walls. With the slow evaporation of water, NPs gradually accumulated in the middle part of the water stripe. wing to the strong van der Waals attraction between the ligands utside particle surfaces, dispersive nanoparticles were closely ompact along the water stripe direction, yielding 1D assembly of NPs in the centers of the nanochannels (Fig. 7d).\nSince the occupation probability of each particle is the same n the LBIA process, high concentrated particle suspension leads o wider 1D assemblies, while dilute liquid can result in narrow, ven single particle in width, linear architectures. Taking the GNPs s an example [67], the GNPs with diameter of 4̃5 nm were mixed ith PVA and assembled upon pillar-structured substrates (Fig. 6k). rdered zigzag-type GNP assemblies could be prepared, whose idths were tunable ranging from 6 to 8 GNPs to single GNP, nd even bead-shaped nanowires (Fig. 8). Within ultra-low GNP oncentration in the polymeric solution, sparse GNPs were conected by thin PVA wires after undergoing the LBIA [78] process see Fig. 8f). Soon after that, grooved substrates were used to guide he assembly of silver NPs (SNPs) [66]. 1D architecture with single article in width was achieved by carefully tailoring the concenration of SNP suspension (Fig. 6l). The particle size in the LBIA can ange from several nanometers, such as quantum dots (Fig. 6m), to ven hundreds of nanometers, like polystyrene (PS) microspheres Fig. 6o) [63,66,78,88]. Wide distribution of particle size does not ffect the performance of LBIA process (see irregular commercial itaninm dioxide particles in Fig. 6n). However, narrower distriution of particle size could yield more ordered arrangement of articles (see Fig. 6o). Magnetic ferriferrous oxide NPs can also be\nassemblies with tunable widths from (a) 6–8, (b) 4–6, (c) 3–4, (d) 2 to (e) single rom Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.\naligned in one direction by the LBIA strategy without the assistance of externally magnetic field (Fig. 6p) [70].\n2D nanomaterials\n2D materials consist of a single layer of atoms, and show promising application in photovoltaics, semiconductors, electrodes and water purification due to their unusual physical characteristics. The graphene nanosheets were difficult to dissolve in the water, requiring the assistance of considerable surfactants. 1D assemblies of graphene nanosheets could be fabricated when the weight ratio of surfactant/graphene was around 152̃0 (Fig. 6q) [97]. Besides arranging graphene nanosheets, the LBIA strategy can directly synthesize ordered stripes of graphdiyne (Fig. 6r) [98], a two dimensional network of benzene rings connected by diacetylenic linkages. A grooved substrate was closely integrated with a flat cooper foil, and placed in the hexaethynylbenzene-loading pyridine liquid. The liquid bridge arrays generated inside the groove gaps provided a 1D spacing for the synthesis of graphdiyne, allowing for their regular stripes that can be transferred onto a flexible polymeric substrate.\nApplications of LBIA dominated 1D assemblies\nLBIA strategy enables ordered patterning of 1D assemblies, indicating an effective way to precisely control the transporting route of physical signals along the 1D architecture. Towards practical applications, especially for device integration, several technical requirements are raised. For example, a large scale yet time-saving method to position metallic nanoparticles is necessary in the fabrication of electronic microcircuits. To solve this problem, a room-temperature, high-throughput and easyto-large-scale printing technology has been proposed by Song et al. (Fig. 9a,b) [88,99–112]. Ordered GNP-loading drops were inkjet-printed onto a hydrophobic plate, serving as the microscale lyophilic domains to pin the liquid. Accordingly, microscale liquid bridges arrays could be generated to connect neighbouring printed dots. In spite of its handiness in introducing lyophilic domains onto the lyophobic substrate, the size limitation should be noticed in this strategy. Compared with the precision (several micrometers) of pillar-structured substrates fabricated by the photolithography, the size of printing dots is commonly tens of micrometers, indicating a greatly reduced density of final 1D assemblies.\nFurthermore, broadening the choice of solvent species in the LBIA strategy is quite important since only soluble, or easily dispersible functional materials can be assembled. For example, functional DTT-DPP molecules (Fig. 6h) are oil soluble, rather than water soluble. In order to treat such matters, the superhydropho-\nC.

In most device applications, 1D assemlies of functional materials should directly grow upon the flat ilicon substrates, instead of upon superhydrophobic templates. herefore, a transfer process of as-prepared 1D assemblies from uperhydrophobic templates to the desired substrates is inevitably equired, indicating potential damage or loss of 1D structures. o avoid this transfer manipulation, a s̈andwichẗype integration ystem has been built, allowing for direct positioning of 1D assemlies upon the top desired substrates (Fig. 9e,f) [7,60,72–74]. ecently, regular lyophobic photoresist stripes [113–125] have een deposited onto a lyophilic silicon substrate to generate rdered liquid bridge arrays. The mechanism is similar to that f microgrooved method [60]. The lyophobic photoresist stripes uptured and restricted the dewetting of liquid, allowing for the xistence of numerous parallel liquid bridges at the edges of each hotoresist stripes. Since the photoresists are sensitive to several rganic solvents, such as acetone or chloroform, the selection of iquids, as well as related functional materials, should be carefully onsidered in this technology.\nAfter inducing above-mentioned strategies to meet the device pplication, several representative applications of precisely paterning functional materials will be discussed, mainly focusing on he optical, electrical and magnetic fields.\na), (e), (i) after the LBIA process, respectively.

These 1D structures exhibited yellow fluorescence whereas the joint part are dark when exposed to 325 nm centered UV irradiation (Fig. 10b) [61]. Once the bead-shaped wires met the fog containing 10−7 wt% plumbous nitrate, their calcein beads would be directly quenched, displaying completely dark appearances (Fig. 7c,d). This local fluorescence quenching behavior shows the ability of LBIA resulted 1D assemblies to detect trace chemicals.\nTo break diffraction limitation of optical transport (usually more than half a wavelength of light ( /2)), localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) has been recognized as an effective route to manipulate the photon transport at the nanoscale. Plasmonic waveguiding by using as-prepared GNP chains was investigated (Fig. 10e,f) [67]. A 514 nm laser beam was focused onto the NP chain, and an output light spot appeared on the right side (Fig. 10g). Owing to a great loss existing among the NPs, the propagation distance of this 1D architecture was just 2.1 m (Fig. 10h). Even by reducing the width of NP chains down to around 100 nm, the propagation distance of SNP chains only reached up to 3.2 m [66], which is much smaller than that required in device applications. To address this challenge, single crystalline BPEA wires were more suitable for\nC.

The ropagation distance of the light along the BPEA wire was more han 180 m with an optical loss of 0.0131 ± 0.0004 dB m−1.\n1D arrays of magnetic NPs can be used in application of color dislay due to their tunable 1D periodic structure and light reflectivity pon an external magnetic field. One example reported by Kwon t al. is illustrated to demonstrate the colour display application of P 1D structures [126]. The superparamagnetic colloidal nanocrysal clusters (CNCs) were first dispersed in a mixture of ethanol nd photocurable resin (Fig. 10i). In the presence of applied magetic field, CNCs were assembled to form 1D chains, which were ubsequently fixed by solidifying the resin through patterned ultra-\nf 1D NP assemblies indicates high aspect ratio, allowing for increased anisotropy of ctively.

The interparticle space of 1D chains could be tuned by exerting a magnetic field with different strength, resulting in desired colours. By repetitive tuning and fixing the structure colour, programmed micropatterns with different colours were successfully attained (Fig. 10k–m).\nElectronics\nElectrons can be guided to transport along SNP 1D assemblies. Non-conductive PDMS micropillars were used to form SNP chains (Fig. 11a,b), then tested their conductivity (Fig. 11c) [58].

Furthermore, an oiloluble DTT-DPP polymer has been fabricated as strictly aligned anowire arrays by utilizing an underwater superoleophobic pillartructured template (Fig. 11e,f) [64]. After integrating the 1D tructures into a flexible field effect transistor (FET), the saturation obility of wire devices are nearly 2 times compared with that of hin-film countpart by using the same material (Fig. 11g,h). Imporantly, narrow 1D spacing of liquid bridges restricted the alignment f rigid planar macromolecules, allowing for a more regular moleclar stacking compared with that prepared by traditional solution ethods. These regularly packed molecules can effectively transort electrons/holes, leading to an advanced mobility in the FET pplications.\nOrdered packing of organic molecules can enhance the transport fficiency of electrons/holes, leading to high-performance electrical evices. In recent decade, directional shearing force in the liquids as been recognized as an effective tool to arrange the molecules. ao’s [127] and Jiang & Su’s group [79] used a fluid-enhanced crysal engineering to induce the packing of TIPS-pentacene molecules Fig. 11i,j). Owing to the directional shearing forces inside the liqid bridges, single crystalline small molecular belt arrays were abricated, and could be integrated into a flexible pressure senor (Fig. 11k). The as-prepared flexible device was sensitive to the xternal force, showing a 5.21 kPa−1 sensitivity during 0 and 300 Pa nd a stable loading-unloading lifetime for more than 1000 cycles. ue to its excellent electrical performance, as well as the flexibilty, the belt array based sensor could be attached onto the wrist of uman to directly detect the pulse. Fig. 11l shows the typical pulse ressure curve consisting of three clearly different peaks (P1 to P3), ndicating the potential of the device to monitor human health.\nagnetics\nNatural creatures own a ubiquitous magnetosensitivity that elp them to locate, build activities, and long-distance migraion. Learning from the nature, highly oriented 1D assemblies of\nagnetic ferriferrous oxide NPs were fabricated though the LBIA rocess (Fig. 12a) [70]. Owing to linear close-packing of magetic NPs, their magnetization intensity reached the maximum alue when the magnetic field direction was parallel to their axis, hereas dropped to the minimum value in the vertical direction Fig. 12b). The ratio of maximum/minimum magnetization intenity highly depended on the width of NP chains. By decreasing the idth value from 0.82 m to 0.16 m, the magnetization ratio can e increased from 1.29 to 4.02 accordingly (Fig. 12c–h). This result ndicates an artificial magnetic detector based on the 1D assemblies f magnetic NPs.\nonclusions\nThis Review summarizes recent progress on precisely posiioning 1D patterning, from small molecules to macromolecules nd nanomaterials, through a LBIA strategy. The mechanism, rules or selecting the functional materials and strategies to tune the ocations and structures of 1D assembles are discussed in detail. wing to anisotropic linear structure, tunable material species, ontrollable molecular packing, and on-demand positioning upon a esired substrate, the 1D assemblies dominated by the LBIA process an find promising application in optical, electrical and magnetic\nelds.\nThe research on LBIA strategy has just started, and considerable hallenges exist in its development. First, most functional mateials dissolve in organic solvents, rather than water. To control\n25 (2019) 13–26\nthe dewetting process of organic solvents with different surface tensions ranging from 2̃0 to 6̃0 dyn/cm, the lyophilic/lyophobic domains or substrates should be carefully designed according to the organic liquids. Secondly, assembling small molecules into single crystalline 1D microstructures can facilitate the waveguiding, [59,60], highly sensitive photodetectior [128] or even the laser field [72–74]. Careful selection of functional molecular segments and related organic solvent to favor the close-packing of small molecules will be the key in this direction. Thirdly, the transport loss of NP based 1D structures is considerable, especially in optical application [66,67]. Alternatively, the application of these NP chains to detect the field [70] or gas sensors [129] are promising. The key advantage of LBIA strategy is the employment of self-contractive liquid bridges as confined spacing to restrict 1D assembly of guest materials. Accordingly, this soft confined spacing can be narrower down to several nanometer size, leading to NP chains with single NP in width (Fig. 6l). This feature can also facilitate the nonlinear polymer rheology and DNA technology in future [94,95]. Finally, we believe that ordered 1D assemblies/structures of functional materials through the LBIA process will offer new opportunities that might favor different application fields.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by National 1000 Young Talents Program of China, and initiatory financial support from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).\nReferences\n[1] J.
