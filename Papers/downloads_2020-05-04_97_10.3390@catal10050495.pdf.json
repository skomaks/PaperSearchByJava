      "text" : "Two-dimensional layered materials have substantial research due to their amazing structural [1–3], mechanical [4], electronic [5,6], and optical properties [7]. Apart from graphene, transition metals dichalcogenides (TMDs), phosphorene, and their derivatives are illustrations of the extreme examined 2D materials. The finding of 2D-layered titanium carbide powder (Ti3C2), the first candidate of the MXene family, in 2011 has unique structural and electronic features, permitting their usage on numerous possible applications [8,9]. MXenes are the latest group of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides. The MXenes (Mn+1XnTx, whereas M refers to Sc, V, Cr, Ti, Zr, Mo, Nb, Hf, Ta; X refers to nitrogen or carbon, and T refers to -OH, -O, and -F) can be prepared by selective etching of (Al, Cd, Si, P, S, Ga, As, Ge, In, Sn, Ti, Pb elements) layers from three-fold metal nitrides and carbides (MAX phase). Usually, Mn+1AXn (MAX) phases are the starting compounds, and MXenes are formed by specifically etching the A layers, where A denotes Al or Si (Figure 1). Major properties have since been reported, such as graphene-like layered structure, hydrophilicity, electrical conductivity, and flexibility. Nearly 30 combinations of materials have been previously produced, and so many were projected hypothetically [10,11]. MXenes have been broadly studied for their applications in numerous fields; for example, MXenes have been researched as new materials for Li-ion batteries (LIBs), electrodes, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, adsorption, and catalysts [12,13]. In this review, we systematically present the techniques to synthesize MXene-based catalysts, followed by crucial comments and probable solutions.

Next, the adaptability and low cost of this method make it highly well-liked for synthesizing MXene materials and tremendously suitable for original research. MXene materials are produced by ball-milling with the assistance of liquid surfactants or solid exfoliation agents, as ball-milling of materials (bulk precursor) regularly manufactures nanosized particles owing to high-energy collisions [24].\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 3 of 28\nIn this liquid-phase impregnation method, the loading solution is mixed with the mesoporous material, and then the solvent is evaporated. The incipient wetness impregnation method refers to impregnation using a solution with a volume equal to the pore volume of the materials [25]. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is a procedure in which the substrate is exposed to one or more unpredictable precursors, which respond and decay on the substrate surface to create the needed thin film deposition [26]. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a new technique that uses pressure-driven powder consolidation in which a pulsed direct electric current passes via a sample squeezed in a graphite matrix. It is too identified as field-assisted or pulse electric current sintering [27]. Transition metal atoms into a perovskite (host) lattice throughout the preparation in oxidizing atmospheres, and the surface as nanosized metallic particles under reducing conditions have been prepared by in-situ growth [28]. Deposits of one monolayer of metal carbide (MXene) onto an mTMDC (monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide), and to subsequently oxidize the top-layer metal atoms was approached by atomic layer deposition (ALD) [29]. Diverse MXenes can be constructed by Acid etching (HF etching) at room temperature to different temperatures by regulating the concentration of HF and reaction time. HF is a wildly discriminating etchant that is still competent in removing various polytypes of SiC. The etching is a kinetically inhibited development, and each MXene wants a dissimilar etching time to attain an entire conversion. Regularly MXenes with larger n in Mn+1CnTx needs sturdy etching and/or a longer etching time [30,31].\n2.1.2. MXene Preparation\nThe MXene sheets consisting of Al-containing MAX phases can be synthesized using hydrofluoric acid (HF) as an etching solution. For instance, Ti3AlC2 (2.0 g) was gradually added to 40 mL of 40% HF solutions and the reaction mixture was mixed using a stirrer at 60 ◦C for 18 h. The solids in the solution were gathered by centrifuging, washed with double distilled water, and lyophilized. During the synthesis, the subsequent reaction mechanism was followed:\nTi3AlC2 + 3HF→ Ti3C2 + AlF3 + 3/2H2\nTi3C2 + 2H2O→ Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2 Ti3C2 + 2HF→ Ti3C2F2 + H2\nThe etching conditions (HF concentration and time) that were necessary to change a given MAX phase differ extensively, depending on the temperature and particle size. For example, decreasing the particle size of the MAX phase by ball milling can efficiently reduce the essential etching time and the strength of HF [32,33]. Besides, divergences in M-Al bond energies for dissimilar MAX phases also need different etching conditions. For instance, the greater Ti-Al bond energy in Ti2AlC likened with the Nb-Al bond energy in Nb2AlC leads to an increased HF concentration and extended etching time [34]. Therefore, suitable etching conditions are required to accomplish greater yields and finish the exchange of Mxenes from MAX phases. Recently, Halim et al. projected the usage of ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) as an etchant in place of the harmful HF [35]. Ghidiu et al. described the latest greater-yield process for the prompt synthesis of numerous MXene sheets [36]. Herein, they prepared Ti3C2Tx by dissolving Ti3AlC2 powders in hydrogen chloride (HCl) and lithium fluoride (LiF) solutions, and then heated the mixture for 45 h at 40 ◦C. Afterward, the product was collected by washing the sediments thoroughly to eliminate the side products and increased the pH. Moreover, various Ti2CTx morphologies were achieved via using specific surfactants (i.e., centyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB), stearyltrimethylammonium bromide (STAB), dioctadecyldimethlylammonium chloride (DDAC)), and intercalating agents (i.e., p-phosphonic calix[n]arenes) throughout the ultrasonication step. In this process, the ring size of the surfactant controlled the morphology of MXene (crumpled sheets, plates, spheres, and scrolls, correspondingly\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 4 of 28\nwith n = 4, 5, 6, or 8). The preparation and separation of ultrathin 2D Ti3C2 nanosheets were attained by a liquid exfoliation process blending HF etching and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) insertion [16]. Though many investigates are insisting on getting a well-regulated morphology, lateral sizes, architecture, and also a termination group production procedure, other methods were used for MXene nanocomposite preparation. For instance, Mn3O4 nanoparticles sustained on layered Ti3C2 MXene (Mn3O4/MXene nanocomposite) have been prepared by the ultra-sonication method [37]. Hierarchical Ti3C2 QDs/Cu2O nanowires/Cu heterostructures were prepared via a simple self-assembly strategy [38]. Arranging g-C3N4 nanosheets with Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposites were synthesized via the interface electrostatic interaction method [39]. Construct MXene/CuO nanocomposite was prepared by the thermal decomposition method [40]. The multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) patterned with MoS2 quantum dots (MoS2 QDs), and Ti3C2Tx QDs (MoS2QDs@Ti3C2TxQDs@MWCNTs) were prepared by the hydrothermal method [41]. MXene Ti3C2 nanosheets were synthesized via hot-pressed sintering technique using concentrate HF solution with various calcination temperatures (400, 600, and 800 ◦C) [21]. Mo-based MXenes were fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration method [23]. Michael et al. have fabricated titanium carbide MXene via the hydrothermal method. MXene nanosheets terminated with different functional groups using post-processing techniques [42]. Ling et al. have prepared MXene with polymer [Polydiallyidimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)] composites using the HF etching method [31]. MXene/graphene oxide fiber was prepared by a liquid crystal assisted fiber spinning technique [43]. MXene/rGO fibers have prepared via the wet-spinning assembly method [44]. Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene via ball milling has reported by Ghidhu et al. [38]. Li et al. have demonstrated the MXene with electrochemically exfoliated graphene by solution processing method [45]."

Supplementary peaks were observed in the Mn3O4/MXene XRD pattern, implying Mn3O4 particles are formed on MXene [46]. The XRD pattern displays the fabrication of Ti3AlC2 MAX phase. The intensity of the peaks originated from the parent Ti3AlC2 bulk consecutively reduced after HF etching and TPAOH intercalation [47]. Heterostructures with Ti3C2 QDs or Ti3C2 sheets related peaks (Figure 2a) represent an amorphous carbon signal nearby 24◦ [48]. Ti3C2 nanoparticles designate diffraction peaks at 9.2, 18.4, and 27.6◦, corresponding to the (0 0 2), (0 0 4), and (0 0 8) reflections, correspondingly. Additionally, the transformation of Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2 nanoparticles is further affirmed by the vanishing of the sturdiest peak of diffraction at 39.2◦ of Ti3AlC2 and the lower shift of the (0 0 4) peaks [49]. Diffraction peaks matching to both MXene and CuO were viewed in the pattern of MXene/CuO nanocomposite (Figure 2b), and the peak intensity increased with the increased content of CuO, demonstrating the fabrication of the MXene/CuO composite [50]. The clear peak at 2θ of 26.2◦ in the XRD pattern of the Ti3C2Tx QDs resembles the restacking of graphene layers [51]. The stretching vibration at 3400, 725, and 1050 cm−1 were allocated to be O-H, C=O, and C-O. The detected OH groups reveal the high hydrophilic property of MXene and Mn3O4/MXene. The structure of MXene reveals by the vibration peak of Ti-O bond appeared at 665 cm−1 [46]. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, where the peaks at 1629.2, 1028.6, and 561.4 cm−1 relate to the modes of stretching vibration for C=O, C-F, and Ti-O groups grafted onto Ti3C2 during synthesis (Figure 2c). Raman spectra of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2 nanosheets, the disappearance of the vibration modes ω2, ω3, and ω4 due to treatment with HF indicates the elimination of the Al layer or the interchange of the Al atoms with additional atoms. Mode ω5 has downshifted and worsened, whereas the mode ω6 has been mixed and repressed, which designates the well-preserved Ti3C2 layer and the increment of interlayer spacing for the structure of MXene [47]. Self-assembly of Ti3C2 samples on Cu2O NWs/Cu is demonstrated by Raman signals at 1383 and 1612 cm−1 that are in agreement with the D and G bands of Ti3C2 samples\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 5 of 28\n(Figure 2d) [48]. XPS result for the nanosheets of Ti3C2 reveals the existence of Ti (IV), TiCxOy, and intrinsic Ti–C bond, which designates the growth of TiO2 or Ti3C2(OH)2 [47]. Successful fabrication of Cu2O NWs/Cu mesh, Ti3C2 sheets/Cu2O NWs/Cu, and Ti3C2 QDs/Cu2O NWs/Cu heterostructures is also validated by the presence of Cu 2p, Ti 2p, and C 1s peaks in the high-resolution XPS [48]. The Ti 2p spectrum displayed in Figure 2e is intricated into six components incorporating the peaks at 461.3 and 455.0 eV assigned to Ti-C 2p1/2 and Ti-C 2p3/2 and also the peaks at 464.7 and 459.1 eV assigned to Ti-O 2p1/2 and Ti-O 2p3/2, correspondingly. The peaks at 462.5 and 456.5 eV are attributed to Ti−X (Ti2+), which resembles the sub-stoichiometric TiC or titanium oxycarbides [49]. The presence of C–Ti bonds at 282.2 eV in the high-resolution spectra of C 1s demonstrated the retained structure of MXene after hybridization with CuO. The two main binding energy peaks at 932.7 and 952.6 eV with the splitting peak of 19.9 eV in the high-resolution spectrum of Cu 2p could be ascribed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, consistently.

      "text" : "Electronic and electrical properties are in the center of energy storage systems. The electrical and electronic properties of MXene can be tailored by modification of functional groups, solid-solution configuration, or stoichiometry. According to scientific methods, electric conductivity values of MXenes pressed discs were identical with multi-layered graphene (resistance values from 22Ω to 339Ω, relying on the “n” index and its molecular formula), and were greater compared to 0.1 mg/mL CNTs (Carbon nanotubes) and 1 wt% RGO (Reduced graphene oxide) materials [8,14]. It has also been noticed that the resistance of MXenes highly depends on the number of layers and type of functional group. It increases with a higher number of layers [34,53–56]. Table 1 summarizes the electrical conductivity of numerous MXenes and composites prepared by different methods. It has been observed that the electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx differed from 850 to 9880 S.cm−1 [57,58]. The variation in electrical conductivity is assumed due to the alterations on the (i) surface functional groups, (ii) defect concentration, (iii) delamination yield, (iv) lateral sizes, and (v) d-spacing between MXenes flakes provoked by each method of etching. Generally, poor concentrations of HF and shorter etching times produce MXenes with reduced imperfections and larger lateral sizes, rendering greater electrical conductivities. Surrounding environments, mainly humidity, might also affect their conductivities, facing in the direction of applications of comparative humidity sensing material [59–61]. Surface modification is an important tool to enhance the electrical properties of MXenes via thermal and alkaline processes. In particular, surface modification processes result, in addition or part of functional groups (specifically—F), and intercalating molecules. Many details about electronic structures of MXenes and correlated features are reported in a current review work of Hantanasirisakul et al. [62].\nFrom Table 1, MXene based composites by hydrothermal method show good electrical properties (electrical conductivity, resistivity, etc.) and also highly useful in many applications such as sensors and screens."

In another study, Ti3C2 Quantum Dots (QDs)/ Cu2O NWs composites were prepared. Coating by Ti3C2 QDs does not modify the complete morphology of Cu2O NWs but shields the porous surfaces (Figure 3). Effective deposition of Ti3C2 QDs was also established by elemental mapping. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) morphological analysis confirmed that plentiful Ti3C2 QDs were consistently immobilized on Cu2O NWs with close contact. It was also proved by the identical spreading of C, Ti, Cu, and O elements disclosed by elemental mapping [48].

Mn3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of MXene were investigated by TEM and HRTEM. TEM image evidenced the presence of Mn3O4 nanoparticles with a diameter of 5–18 nm. The HRTEM image of Mn3O4/MXene displayed the Lattice fringes with inter-planar distances of 0.307 nm, which was allocated to be (1 1 2) plane of hausmannite. The inter-planar distance of 0.242 nm resembles the (1 0 3) plane of MXene [46]. The MXene sheets are layered structures that are even and soft with pointed edges, while Gd3+- and Sn4+-multi doped bismuth ferrite (BFO) nanocomposites are enclosed on the surface of MXene sheets [65]. In the case of MXene quantum dots with cuprous oxide nanowire (Ti3C2/Cu2ONWs/Cu) nanocomposite, Cu2O nanowires cover the MXene porous surfaces (Figure 3d) [44]. MXene/50% CuO (Figure 3a–c) showed CuO nanoparticles with 60–100 nm diameters, which were randomly deposited on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Figure 3c), and were stabilized through van der Walls interactions [50].\n3.3. Optical Properties\nThe UV and visible light absorptions are essential for the development of photocatalytic, optoelectronic, photovoltaic, and transparent conductive electrode devices. MXenes are possible compounds for adaptable, transparent electrode studies, whereas their greater reflectivity in the UV range directs towards anti-ultraviolet emissions coating materials, because of their transparent optical property in the visible range and electrical conductivity. Ti3C2Tx films can absorb light in the range of UV–visible between 300 to 500 nm. The transmittance of the Ti3C2Tx films varied concerning the thickness, and the 5 nm thick film displayed transmittance up to 91% (Figure 4a). It has been suggested that there might be a presence of a strong and wide absorption band at approximately 700–800 nm, based on the thickness of the film (Figure 4b–c). It results in the pale green color and is essential for photothermal therapy (PTT) investigations. Remarkably, the transmittance properties can be improved via varying the film thickness and intercalation of ions. For example, while urea, hydrazine, and DMSO decrease Ti3C2Tx film transmittance, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (NMe4OH) increases it from 74.9 to 92.0% (Figure 4d) [66–69].\nThe SEM images of MoS2QDs@Ti3C2TxQDs@MWCNTs-2 nanocomposite only di plays anotube- ike structure, in which the Ti3C2Tx QDs and MoS2 QDs were not noticed, retai ing to their ultra-small sizes.

The ypothetical Lithium storage capacity of Ti3C2 (in the form of Ti3C2Li2) was 320 mAh/g, related to that of graphite 372 mAh/g. Also, the projected diffusion barrier (0.07 eV)\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 9 of 28\nfor Lithium on bare Ti3C2 was less compared to graphite (0.3 eV), which expected outstanding high-rate performance for simple MXene [77]. Yet, as noticed beyond, all synthesized MXene sheets are terminated with surface groups, probably worsening their functioning by stimulated steric hindrance. Contrasted with some additional terminated MXene sheets, an O-terminated MXene was recommended to retain very good capacitance [78–80]. The higher capacities of MXene based LIBs were ascribed to (i) enhanced electrolyte ions approachability and diffusion routes to MXene layers; (ii) greater charge storage because of their delaminating layers; (iii) metal hybridization with greater capacitance and outstanding conductivity; (iv) speedier ion diffusion; and (v) lesser interfacial charge transfer [81]. For instance, new structured MXenes-CNTs associations and porous Ti3C2Tx formed by freeze-drying postponed MXenes re-loading and gave rise to very good properties in comparison to MoS2/graphene nanocomposites (Figure 5a–c) [82,83]. This should be emphasized that MXenes could also be infused by some additional metal ions like Na+, K+, Al3+, and Mg2+. Therefore, they could be employed in non-LIBs; those have their usage recently restricted by suitable electrode properties [79]. Ti2C hypothetical capacities for Mg2+ and Al3+ were amongst all the uppermost ever projected for both kinds of ion batteries (687 mAhg−1 and 992 mAhg−1 correspondingly) (Figure 5d–e) [84]. Moreover, the probability of sodium ions multilayer adsorptions entices with more attention. Current literature also reveals assuring characteristics as including conductive materials in Li–S type of batteries. It is a promising battery system that gives hypothetical energy densities up to 1675 mAhg−1 (Figure 5f) [85], but is restricted by their quick capacity degradation because of polysulfide moving and dissolution, greater enlargement of volume and worse electrical conductivity of sulfur related cathodes [22,25,86,87]. Therefore, MXene’s growth could head to novel routes on the electrode materials of NLiBs. From Table 2, the MXene with metal oxide composite exhibited high reversible capacity and rate capability due to the enhanced conductivity and contribution of the capacitive capacity.\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 10 of 28\nCatalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 29\nFigure 5.

MXene for Energy Storage: Supercapacitors/Dielectrics\nMXenes also widely used in developing supercapacitors that are taken into account in replacements of energy storage devices due to elevated rates of charge/discharge compared to batteries and longer cycling stability. For example, multilayered Ti3C2Tx offered functioning of 340 F/cm3 in KOH alkaline\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 11 of 28\nsolutions [91], which is identical or finer than marketable activated and graphene carbon electrodes (correspondingly, 200–350 and 180 F/cm3) [92]. When subjected to acidic solutions, such as H2SO4, the Ti3C2Tx film disclosed very good volumetric capacitance values (900 F/cm3 at 2 mVs−1 rate), even after 10,000 cycles, without degradation [91–93]. This dissimilar performance in acidic and alkaline electrolytes originates from the variance in the mechanism of the charge-discharge process. Whereas Ti3C2Tx has shown excellent pseudocapacitive properties in an acidic solution (e.g., H2SO4), only electrical double layer capacitance is observed in alkaline or neutral electrolytes that decreases their performance. Notably, pseudocapacitive performance is connected to closeness towards the electrode surfaces at, or the reversible surface redox reactions that give elevated energy density. Whereas, the double-layer capacitor depends on the reversible growth of electrolyte ions deprived of redox reactions. Subsequently, their decreased electrochemistry performances in basic and organic electrolytes are unfavorable steps towards realistic applications. Additionally, their charge storage processes above dissimilar electrolyte media are still to be completely implicit [94–96]. MXenes have a robust tendency of aggregation through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals attraction. This spoils their performance, mostly due to the lack of accessibility, the loss of surface area, and interchange of ions limitation. Therefore, other approaches have been adopted to resolve these issues, like usage of interlayer spacers, customized architectural designs (such as macroporous structure, hydrogel, or vertically aligned liquid-crystalline), the combination of these approaches and arrangement with conductive particles (e.g., Nb2O5 and NiO) [97,98]. Other compounds, such as Mo2CTx [99] and Mo1.33CTx [100], also revealed promising functionality as supercapacitors. Regardless of the valuable effect of vacancies to Mo1.33CTx capacitance (around 700 F/cm3, 65% higher than Mo2CTx), their effect on electrochemical functioning yet needs to be further examined. Additionally, it was currently established that the flake size is quietly associated with the capacitance presentations. Ultimately, Nb3C2 projected quantum capacitance was greater than graphene, but neither this MXene, nor it’s MAX phase precursors (Nb3AlC2) have still been prepared, regardless of their projected stability [101,102]. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx-polypyrrole nanocomposite (1000 F/cm3) can almost reach the “new” (Mo2/3Y1/3)2CTx [103] and Ti3C2Tx [104] hydrogels performances (~1500 F/cm3) [39], that are among the best conveyed volumetric capacitance values for any capacitive compound (Table 3) [105]. Ultimately, regardless of many prepared MXenes, only molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), and currently vanadium (V) derivatives were examined [106]. Therefore, other compounds must be assessed in turn to enlarge and improve the latest electrode materials of supercapacitors as the MXene based nanocomposites are highly suitable for the development of superior capacitors (Table 3).\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 12 of 28\nThe dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of MXene/Polymer composites with variation in the MXene loading and different polymers have also been investigated (Figure 6a). It has been noticed that the dielectric permittivity of composites increases when MXene filler concentration increases. Figure 6b shows the dielectric permittivity and loss of the polymer consisting of different types of fillers, including CNTs, rGO, and MXene. The dielectric constant of different types of insulating polymers [e.g., P(VDF-TrFE-CFE), P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), P(VDF-TrFE), and PVP] increases significantly with the addition of 4 wt% MXene (Figure 6c). To understand the probable microwave absorption property, the relative complex permittivity and permeability of the prepared samples have also been measured in the frequency range of 2–18 GHz and evaluated carefully in Figure 6d. The relative complex permeability (µ’) values of the prepared MXene composites fluctuate over 2–18 GHz and are less than 1.1. The µ′′ values of the prepared samples decreased from 0.78 to nearly 0 due to snoek’s limitation (Figure 6e). Figure 6f describes the dielectric dissipation factors of the samples.

      "text" : "Due to suitable physical and chemical properties, MXene can potentially be used for CO2 storage and photo-, electrochemical reduction. Recently, CO2 storage on the surface of M2C MXene (M = transition metals such as Ti, Hf, Zr, V, Ta, Nb, Mo, W) (0001) is described by employing the state-of-the-art DFT PBE estimations comprising D3 Grimme correction dispersion. Outputs reveal elevated adsorption energies up to 3.69 eV supplemented by a CO2 stimulation, converted into anionic CO2 d species with extended d(CO) bonds, bent structures, and an MXene/CO2 charge transfer, unexpectedly above 2e for Hf2C [112,113]. With these elevated adsorption energies, M2C MXenes are projected to be most efficient compared to their 3D bulk accompaniment for CO2 capturing, storage, and stimulation. 2D M2C MXenes are introduced as potential materials for CO2 capture, whereas its stimulated adsorption is further enchanting for employing them as CO2 conversion catalysts [114–116]. The activity of transition metal carbides as CO2 conversion materials has been described by Zhou et al.’s that proved M2CO2 with an oxygen vacancy as an effective catalyst for CO2 reduction. Also, it should be noted that: (i) MXenes have broad metal-terminated surfaces, that may favor CO2 capturing; and (ii) MXenes shows metallic characters, that are useful for the different photo- and electrochemical reactions [117]. In particular, computing that chemical absorption of CO2 has favored over chemical absorption of H2O on their surfaces [118–120]. Additionally, the expectation that high electrical conductivity and the hydrophilic nature will accelerate an electrochemical reduction of CO2, in consideration of both giving electrons and H+ attachment [121]. From this context, we assume that groups of IV−VI MXenes, such as carbides of transition-metal with formulas Mn+1Cn (n = 2), can work as efficient catalysts. MoS2/Si nanostructure exhibits good activity by the photoelectrochemical method (Figure 7A,B). The CV response of the Bi/C electrode showed an electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (Figure 7C).\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 14 of 28 Catalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 29\nPhotocatalytic CO2 conversion to beneficial products is an attractive methodology for attaining the two-fold profits of standardizing additional atmospheric CO2 stages and the fabrication of solar fuels/chemicals.

An initial computational study has suggested that among eight different MXenes (pristine and without surface termination) with formula M3C2 where M belongs to group IV, V, and VI transition-metal, can potentially convert CO2 into hydrocarbon electrochemically. It has been mentioned that Cr3C2 and Mo3C2 with a minimum energy input of 1.05 and 1.31 eV, respectively, can selectively convert CO2 into methane. The required input energy can be further reduced to 0.35 and 0.54 eV by using −O or −OH terminated Cr3C2 and Mo3C2, respectively. Therefore, Chen et al. perform additional computational study for −OH terminated carbide and nitride MXenes [137]. Sc2C(OH)2 and Y2C(OH)2 were suggested to be the most promising catalysts for the selective production of methane via CO2RR. Both catalysts can reduce CO2 at significantly less negative potential than the Cu metal. Here it should be noted that most of the standard nanocatalysts except Cu are not able to produce higher carbon products during CO2RR [138]. For instance, Au and Ag-based nanocatalysts produce only carbon monoxide (CO) as a CO2RR product. However, Cu based nanocatalysts can produce hydrocarbon but suffer from poor selectivity, as discussed in our previous review [139]. Thus, we predict that MXene-based catalysts offer a breakthrough in CO2RR but still need to be examined experimentally."

Further, Guoxing Qu et al. synthesized phosphorus-doped Mo2CTx MXenes (P–Mo2CTx) and compared the results with un-doped Mo2CTx MXenes and commercial Pt/C (Figure 8 a,b) [144].\nIt has been argued that dopant enhances the conductivity of the materials as evidence by ~5 times lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) than that of without dopant and reduces the ΔGH* simultaneously. More interestingly, P–Mo2CTx was stable for 24 h in acidic media. Wenjin Yuan et al. examined the HER activity of lamellar Mo2C (L-Mo2C) and interestingly 10 mA cm–2geo current density was achieved at only 95.8 mV and 170 mV overpotential in 1M KOH and 0.5M H2SO4 solution, correspondingly [145]. The superior HER activity of L-Mo2C was mainly attributed to the lower value of ΔGH (−0.034 eV) of the C-terminal (1 0 0) plane in Mo2C. Due to the participation of C atoms in HER, L-Mo2C exhibits superior stability, avoiding poisoning phenomena due to oxidation of atoms.

However, the results claim poor performance of V4C3Tx as 10 mA cm−2geo current density was observed at ~ −800 mV, and a high Tafel slop (~236 mV/dec) was calculated. Surprisingly, the performance of the catalysts improves after 100 cycles, and 10 mA cm−2geo current density has been obtained at 200 mV lower overpotential. Compare to nanoparticles or nanoflakes MXene, MXene nano-fibers exhibit superior HER activity due to the simple enhancement in an extreme specific surface area (SSA), and thus, the availability of additional active sites. The catalytic activity can be further boosted by the creation of interface or hybrid structure. Thus, Jie Xiong et al. created Mo/β-Mo2C hetero-nanosheets and identified that Mo/β-Mo2C nanocatalysts require only 89 mV to drive HER with a current density of 10 mA cm−2geo in 0.5 M H2SO4 [147]. More importantly, Mo/β-Mo2C’s HER activity remains approximately unaffected after 20 h of long chronoamperometric electrolysis or 4000 I-V sweeps. Again the origin for improved catalytic activity was assumed due to lower ∆GH (−0.04 eV) for Mo/β-Mo2C compared to those of individual Mo (−0.39) and β-Mo2C (−0.19 eV). Considering that the basal plan is responsible for higher HER activity, Albertus D. Handoko performed controlled experiments by varying the degree of basal plan functionality using Ti3C2Tx as an example [148]. DFT calculations, along with experimental results, confirm that replacing O with F (fluorine) on basal plan results in higher ∆GH and HER overpotential. Recently Ti3C2Tx and MoS2 hybrid catalysts\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 17 of 28\nwere also designed in search of efficient HER catalysts [149]. In brief, “nanoroll” like MoS2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid structure was synthesized by quick freezing of the Ti3C2Tx and MoS2 precursor (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) followed by annealing in H2/Ar (20%/80%) atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 ◦C/min. The HER results show relatively improved performance as HER initiate only at 30 mV, and an approximately 25-fold rise in the exchange current density in comparison to the MoS2 nanoflakes. Double transition metal MXene nanosheets (Mo2TiC2Tx) consisting of Mo vacancies in outer layers have also been used to immobilize Pt atom and examined for HER [150]. In this configuration, due to solid covalent interaction among positively charged Pt single atoms and the MXene, it has unusual high HER activity. The HER takes place at very low potential, and 10, and 100 mA cm−2 current densities were recorded only at 30 and 77 mV over potential, respectively (Table 6). MXene based nanomaterials (Table 6) showed the high overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 medium (HER activity) due to the increased reaction content area is profitable to the interaction between Mxenes and hydrogen atoms."

      "text" : "The developments of cutting-edge skills, like fuel cells and metal-air batteries, afford great potential and supportable replacement solutions to challenge environmental issues and increasing severe energy [151–153]. Extremely active and long-lasting electrocatalysts for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for the extensive range of applications in fuel cells [154]. The state-of-the-art catalysts are importantly dependent on noble metals such as platinum (Pt), but the costly, inadequate resources and worse durability have considerably hindered the marketing of the Pt-grounded fuel cells. Based on this, the investigation of economically cheap metal catalysts has been a leading theme of the electrocatalysts [155]. During the past, many efforts have been made to expand even metal-free alternatives or non-Pt family metals as ORR catalysts. Particularly, the quick growth has been accomplished on metal-free ORR electrocatalysts, such as heteroatom-doped graphene, mesoporous carbons, and CNTs [156]. Currently, investigations on electrocatalysts of MXenes and MXene nanocomposites have got much attentiveness [157,158]. MXenes, holding hydrophilic surface with protuberant stability and conductivity, can be predictable as assuring electrocatalysts. Specifically, the recent literature has concentrated on the MXene composites for electrocatalysts, such as the overlay of g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 nanosheets (Figure 9) composites (TCCN) as a catalyst for ORR process [159].\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 18 of 28\nCatalysts 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 29\nPt-grounded fuel cells.

Specifically, the recent literature has concentrated on the MXene composites for electrocatalysts, such as the overlay of g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 nanosheets (Figure 9) composites (TCCN) as a catalyst for ORR process [159].\nFigure 9.

Copyright: Ref. [51,52].\nThe Ti3C2 MXene-based catalyst has shown excellent ORR activity and stability in the basic medium [160,161]. Through a sandwich-like form comprising of titanium atoms at the terminals or the surface layer and carbon atoms at the innermost layer, the catalyst is a flawless model system for the interpretation of the ORR active sites of this type of 2D layer-by-layer catalysts. This provides a new route to apply Ti3C2 MXene-based catalysts for efficient ORR activity and stability in the basic medium for fabricating greater-functioning and economically cheap electrocatalysts [47]. X Yu et al. have prepared a facile fabrication of g-C3N4 nanosheets with Ti3C2 nanoparticles. The gC3N4/Ti3C2 hybrid-structures show a significant improvement for ORR than that of pure g-C3N4 nanosheets (Figure 9c,d). Also, the electrocatalytic activity is intensely depending on the stacking amount of Ti3C2 nanoparticles. The optimal stacking quantity of Ti3C2 to g-C3N4 is about 2 wt %. The enhanced catalytic performance is ascribed to the improved oxygen adsorption and well-organized charge separation because of the electronic coupling among g-C3N4 and Ti3C2. Predominantly, contrasted with the marketable Pt/C, the g-C3N4/Ti3C2 hybrid-structures reveal good methanol tolerance then again with no intake of valuable metals [52]. The theoretical study has suggested that V2C and Mo2C MXenes with N-doped graphene can potentially be used for ORR due to very low ORR overpotential, i.e., 0.36 V, and low kinetics barriers due to electronic coupling between the n-doped graphene and the MXene [158]. The MoS2QDs@Ti3C2TxQDs@MMWCNTs catalyst (Figure 9a,b) also shows a superior ORR mechanism to other non-Pt catalysts, providing a low Tafel slope of 90 mV dec−1 and greater half potential like E1/2, 0.75 V, that was near to their marketable Pt/C (20%) catalyst (E1/2 of 0.80 V, Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1) [162–166]. Besides, the MoS2QDs@Ti3C2TxQDs@MMWCNTs (Figure 10) also hold better electro-oxidation activity for methanol in basic solution, providing current density at 2.2 V\nCatalysts 2020, 10, 495 19 of 28\nof 160 A·g−1 with extreme methanol oxidation. The outputs signified that the grouping of MoS2 and Ti3C2Tx QDs with MWCNTs could provide a potential for producing the bifunctional electrocatalysts for MOR and ORR [167–174]. From Table 7, Fe doped MXene materials show high oxygen reduction reaction activity (half-wave potential) due to increased oxygen adsorption and charge separation.\nTable 7.

Several MXene-based nanomaterials with extraordinary characteristics have been proposed, prepared, and practiced as a catalyst due to its two-dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, facile decoration, and high adsorption capacity. This review summarizes the synthesis and characterization studies, and the appropriate applications in the catalysis field, exclusively in the energy storage systems. Ultimately, we also discussed the encounters and prospects for the future growth of MXene-based nanomaterials as an efficient candidate in developing efficient energy storage systems. This review delivers crucial knowledge within the scientific community intending to design efficient energy storage systems.",
