      "text" : "Nano-carriers (NCs) provide drugs with protective and oriented strategies. Despite their success in parenteral administration, NCs still need to be optimized to meet the more serious obstacles encountered in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The main defense mechanisms include renewing mucus, epithelial obstacles and digestion by GIT segments. These hurdles pose challenges even before NCs target molecules or proteins, which has often led to unsatisfactory delivery efficiency. Therefore, a critical focus is the exemption from negative effects of GIT. A series of adapted NCs have been designed based on surface strategies to form an expected distribution and increase gastrointestinal utilization. In this paper, we review the strategies and efforts of NCs to adapt to gastrointestinal defense components, including the mucus, epithelium and gastrointestinal segments; the related gastrointestinal mechanisms and functions are also summarized synchronously. Last, we discuss the delivery challenges in terms of physiopathological GIT and surface properties of the NCs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

After administration, drugs for local treatment or whole-body distribution can be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). However, poor solubility, stability and bioavailability make reaching the level of treatment challenging in this way.1 Many aspects of oral delivery have been explored, among which the nano-delivery system has received great attention. Drug-loaded nano-carriers (NCs), including nanoparticles (NPs) (polymer NPs, lipid NPs, inorganic NPs, etc.), micelles, nanoemulsions, liposomes and others have been developed for further dispersion. These methods could reduce the limitations of drug solubility and stability and bring the possibility of gastrointestinal absorption of peptide drugs and vaccines.2\nDespite success in parenteral administration, NCs are still faced by complex problems in GIT that need to be overcome, including (a) degradation and aggregation caused by the acidic lumen fluid and complex components; (b) rapid clearance and prevention of infiltration effects from the mucus layer; (c) low efficiency of transcellular transport and the paracellular transport pathway for drugs; (d) targeted delivery difficulties in the long and narrow GIT with a large surface area; and (e) decreasing retention caused by food propulsion, luminal fluid irrigation and\ninal defense components: surface strategies and challenges.

Stringent gastrointestinal defensive mechanisms lead to unsatisfactory bioavailability. These problems are being gradually solved by methods in consideration of overcoming GIT mucosa biological barriers and optimizing the gastrointestinal targeting. Since the concept of nano-medicine was first put forward at the beginning of the last century, many parenteral nano-preparations have been introduced into the clinic. It was not until the 1990s that the oral product cyclosporine A self-microemulsion was put on the market.3 Gastrointestinal NCs for local treatments such as gastritis, Crohn's disease and gastrointestinal cancer, and for systemic diseases such as diabetes, neurological diseases and vaccines,4 are required for higher efficiency to overcome the gastrointestinal biological barrier or enhance local targeting.\nAt present, many efforts on the surface strategies, including materials, chemical modification, coating and ligand decoration, have been applied in design of NCs to offer the methods more efficiency and meet the rising demand for optimized oral drug delivery systems.5,6 Generally, the design of these formulations depends on the different therapeutic purposes (Table 1 and 2), and their functions relay on unique interactions with GIT components, which there we are focusing on. The delivery modes of these NCs and integrated gastrointestinal environment are briefly summarized in Figure 1. This article reviews the surface strategies and efforts of NCs to adapt to gastrointestinal components for oriented delivery, including the mucus, epithelium and segments of the stomach and intestines,; the related gastrointestinal composition and functions are also summarized synchronously. Last, we discuss the surface property-related delivery challenges in terms of premature denaturation, biosorption and gastrointestinal pathology in gastrointestinal delivery.\nSurface strategies for mucus delivery"

      "heading" : "Gastrointestinal mucus barrier",
      "text" : "Gastrointestinal mucus is secreted by epithelial goblet cells and is distributed throughout the inner surface of GIT widely and unevenly (the distribution and thickness can be seen in Figure 1). The covering forms a barrier which reduces absorption efficiency and blocks targeted delivery. Mucus is a complex hydrogel consisting of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, salts, antibodies, bacteria and cell fragments.8 The outermost layer of mucus is loose, while the inner layer is firm, which forms the basis of the lubrication of the epithelium. The mucus also blocks the destruction of enzymes and acids and prevents the invasion of pathogens.9 The main protein component of mucus is mucin encoded by the MUC gene family.10 There is a regulatory balance between the synthesis, degradation and removal of mucin, which affects the overall thickness of the mucus barrier and makes the loose mucus layer clear and causes it to renew faster.9 ,11 ,12 However, this brings problems to the process of drug movement to the target area in the intestinal cavity. Highly cross-linked mucins form a dense and porous gel sieve that blocks the drug stereoscopically, which makes it difficult for the drug to penetrate the mucus, inducing rapid clearance.8,13\nWhether the delivery is for diseased tissue, pathogens under the mucus layer or for systemic treatment, the surface interactions between mucus barrier and NCs need to be overcome or appropriately taken advantage of. A particularly typical example is the treatment of Helicobacter pylori. Helicobacter pylori (colonizes on gastric epithelial layer but below the mucus layer) infection is the main etiologic factor in the development of gastric inflammation and cancer, but for now, antibiotic therapy still fails\nto eradicate the infection. This issue could be attributed to the insufficient mucosa drug concentration and lack of contact time of formulations in the stomach.14 Improving the retention has been considered as suitable method. Mucus-mediated NCs has been successfully exploited for more efficient GIT delivery via various methods, which have significantly improved drug bioavailability. The mechanisms of oriented NCs designed for adapting mucus show in Figure 2, and will be discussed in detail in the following part of this section."

      "text" : "Traditional (non-adhesive) NCs lack the ability to withstand strong gastrointestinal emptying and cavity fluid flushing. This limitation results in the loss of large amounts of drugs in the area of action or absorption.15 For local treatment or continuous absorption, long-term retention of drugs in the mucus layer is of great significance. Adhesion strategies have been used to adapt NCs to mucus to avoid scavenging effects. With the application of bioadhesive materials or surface chemical modification, the interaction between mucus and NCs is enhanced by electrostatic adsorption, hydrogen bonds, covalent action, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces and polymer chain insertion, forming an adhesion to the mucus.16,17"

      "heading" : "Electrostatic adhesion",
      "text" : "A classical adhesionmethod is electrostatic adsorption between chargedNCs andmucus. A large amount ofmucin brings abundant negatively charged groups to the mucus layer, which can form strong electrostatic adsorption with the positively charged surface.\nAmong all cationic adhesivematerials, chitosan and derivatives are the most widely applied, and participate in the preparation of NCs as carrier bases or coating materials.18 The protonation of amino groups under the low pH conditions can cause the chitosan macromolecules to have a large number of positive charges.19 This provides a strong electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged mucus components and epithelial surface and is widely applied in oral NPs, liposomes, nanogels and self-microemulsion systems.15,20,21 For examples, chitosan-coated liposomes improved the bioavailability of calcitonin more than 2.4-fold in comparison with non-coated positively and negatively charged liposomes after oral administration to rats.22 Insulin-loaded Chitosan-PLGA-NPs exhibited excellent bioadhesion and fluorescence intensity still remained stronger in the gut after 8 h oral administration, while almost no fluorescence could be observed for PLGA-NPs after 7 h.23\nHowever, due to the dependence on protonation, chitosan can only exhibit adhesion and gradually dissolve under acidic conditions (pH < 6). The application of chemically modified chitosan has become a common method for mucoadhesive delivery systems.24 Some chitosan derivatives that dissolve and produce adhesionwithin a broader range of pH values have been developed. The protonated group trimethylchitosan (TMC, -N+(CH3)3) can be positively charged in a neutral pH environment and has a wider range of pH dissolution than unmodified chitosan.25 Such strategies to enhance the solubility range include carboxymethyl chitosans with both amino and carboxyl groups (acid-base amphiphilic), halfacetylated chitosan (soluble at neutral pH), glycol chitosan (hydrophilic and dissolves in almost any pH condition), and so\non. Chitosans derivatives can be adapted tomore situations, such as the loading of pH-sensitive drugs such as genes, peptides and proteins26 or delivery in different compartments of GIT (discuss in section 4). The biologically inspiredmaterial chitosan-catechol has recently attracted much attention for its strong adsorption properties in wet environments27–30 because of its great significance in adhesion under gastrointestinal conditions. The adhesion mechanism of chitosan-catechol is due to the formation of irreversible covalent bonds with the mercaptan group of mucin,27 and further study has shown the combined enhancement effect of the positive charge of the chitosan group on adhesion.31 The NCs based on chitosan’s sensitivity to pH tend to adhere specifically to some gastrointestinal parts, but there present difference in selectivity of adhesion sites. Pluronic F68/PLGA NPs coated with carboxymethyl chitosan are more likely to trigger adhesion and sustained release in the small intestine.32 However, because the isoelectric point of carboxymethyl chitosan is near neutral and acidic pH values,33 there is a large response range in the stomach and intestines.\nThe adhesion of electrostatic mucoadhesive systems is positively correlated with the amount of charge present, which means a large number of positive charges can induce stronger adhesion. However, it should be noted that a strong positive surface charge has the potential risk of cytotoxicity.34 ,35 Although this cytotoxicity has only been observed in a small number of oral-systems studies, it is still worthy of more extensive evaluation."

      "heading" : "Conjuncted-forces adhesion",
      "text" : "The emptying of gastrointestinal contents and movement of muscles can easily eliminate NCs with weak adhesion. Therefore, additional adhesion strategies have been actively explored, including adhesive cellulose derivatives, polymers and some natural materials, which have a variety of adhesion mechanisms. In addition to electrostatic interactions, NCs can also adhere to mucus through hydrogen bonds, winding between polymers and mucins, hydrophobic interactions, or a combination of these methods.36\nAdhesive polymers have been widely used in the formulation of mucoadhesive NCs, and surface or coating materials with cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly (sebacic acid) (PSA), poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) have achieved much success in oral delivery.37–39 The adhesion of polymers is often composed of multiple mechanisms. For example, the adhesion mechanisms of polyacrylic acid (PAA) are composed of the winding of a long polymer chain and mucin fiber, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.40 These effects are not irreversible, and as the mucus renews, they can only last for a certain period of time. Larger molecular weight and flexibility are necessary for longchain entanglement. Although it is difficult to define an optimal molecular weight, some literature mentions that the threshold molecular weight for successful adhesion is 100,000.38 The calcitonin-containing PAA nanoparticles in combination with\nauxiliary agent spermine were orally administered to male Wistar rats.39 The results showed 15.2-fold higher efficacy in hypocalcemia effect compared to calcitonin solution. In another study, rat gastrointestinal tissues were collected and tested at different times after feeding of adhesive NPs based on HPMC and PLGA. The drug suspension on the inner mucosal surface could not be detected after 5 h in the control group, but the NPs still had 21.98% retention after 10 h in the test group, and the adhesion was better than that of chitosan NPs under the same conditions.41 In addition to prolonging residence time, improved oral bioavailability can also be attributed to protection from proteolytic enzymes. Upon exposure to protease degradation, the stability of insulin and calcitonin was improved when encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles.9\nNPs with combined mucoadhesive polymers have been reported to obtain improved adhesion and stability, and no conflict between their adhesion mechanisms was observed. The combination of chitosan and PLGAenhanced themucosal adhesion ofNPs, which was further improved with increasing chitosan concentration, the degree of deacetylation and molecular weight.42 PLGA NPs modified by a chitosan derivative, chitosan oleate, also enhanced the physical and chemical stability, which is stronger than that of similar polymer micelles.43,44 Moreover, the addition of sulfhydryl groups onto the surface through molecular modification also contributes to the enhancement of adhesion (discussed in section “2.1.3”).\nSome natural degradable materials, such as natural polysaccharides and keratin, have the advantage of providing adhesion and also having better safety. Including chitosan, which is mainly based on electrostatic adsorption, common natural polysaccharide adhesion materials, such as alginate and pectin, have also been gradually applied to improve the adhesion of NCs. They contain plentiful hairy chain regions with hydroxyl, ester and carboxylate groups,45 which can enhance mucoadhesive ability via hydrogen bonding, hydration or gelation of the polymer.46 Keratin has reported as a new biocompatible mucoadhesive material.47 Keratose (KOS) and kerateine (KTN) were prepared into keratin complex NPs, radiolabeled and fed to rats, and more than half of the NPs were still detected in the stomach after 8 h. Moreover, it was found that the key adhesion mechanism of KOS and KTN, which carried a cysteine sulfur atom to porcine mucin under acidic conditions (pH=4.5), was not mainly due to the disulfide bond but instead due to the electrostatic adsorption or hydrogen bonds. KOS and KTN are oxidized and reduced keratin,48 and their cysteine sulfur atoms exist in the form of sulfhydryl and sulfonic acid groups, respectively. Therefore, KOS and KTN have different properties which lead the gastric retention and release time can be further controlled by regulation of the ratio of KOS to KTN. These newly developed natural biodegradable adhesive materials have been gradually used to improve therapeutic effects and can provide better safety at the same time."

      "heading" : "Thiolation strategies",
      "text" : "Abundant cysteine and mucin in the mucus layer contain a large number of active sulfhydryl groups, which can easily combine with other sulfhydryl groups to spontaneously form disulfide bonds.49 Although reversible, these covalent bonds\nformed with the mucosal layer are still much stronger than the non-covalent bonds formed by non-thiolated molecules and mirror the natural bonds formed within the mucosal layer itself. In addition, the low pH in the gastrointestinal environment can induce the stronger adhesion of sulfides to mucus than in the neutral environment.\nThis may be because acidity can inhibit the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds and increase the chance of forming disulfide bonds with mucins.50 Therefore, the method of introducing mercapto groups into NCs has been widely adopted to obtain enhanced gastrointestinal adhesion. Common thiol-based sulfurizing agents, including cysteine, thioglycolic acid (TGA), 4-thiobuthylamidine (TBA), N-acetyl-cysteine, isopropyl-S-acetylthioacetimidate and glutathione, can be bound into polymers, natural polysaccharides and proteins. For example, It was reported an up to 6-fold improvement in mucoadhesion of PAA-cysteine nanoparticles compared to unmodified ones.39,51 Because these adhesive materials are rich in hydroxyl, carboxyl, and other active groups, direct or multi-step reactions can lead to the introduction of sulfhydryl groups. Although the enhancement of adhesion is positively correlated with the content of sulfhydryl groups, there is still an intramolecular sulfhydryl interaction. This may change the properties of the NCs or cause unexpected aggregation. At last, the typical mucoadhesive materials were summarized in Table 3."

      "heading" : "Mucus-penetrating strategies",
      "text" : "The protective mechanisms of mucus greatly slow down the free penetration of drugs. Due to the high cross-linking of mucin fibers, the mucus layer forms a microporous structure. It is not only a physical barrier that limits the movement of drugs and NCs but the mucus layer also captures drugs through hydrophilic and lipophilic interactions.54 On the other hand, the outer layer of mucus is loose and renews quickly, while the inner layer is relatively firm and renews slowly. As a result, adhesive NCs are likely not to reach the firmly adherent mucus layer that clears slowly, and are instead trapped in the loosely adherent layer and easily removed quickly within minutes to hours. In addition, adhesive NCs have difficulty moving towards the epithelium and may be exposed to the luminal fluid for a long time.\nMucus penetration is a unique property of NCs, and their nano-size has been proven to help permeate mucus.55 For example, model sphere NPs with a diameter of 500 nm or less can be uniformly observed in porcine stomach mucus with relatively good fluidity, but particles above 500 nm can hardly move.13,56 More importantly, through surface modification or modification strategies, mucus permeating systems can pass through the loose layer of mucus more quickly and reduce exposure to the luminal fluid. As a result, more complete NCs can reach the firm mucus layer or epithelium, resulting in increased retention."

      "heading" : "Muco-inert penetration",
      "text" : "The gastrointestinal muco-inert system usually has a hydrophilic and electronically neutral surface. By avoiding the capture of hydrophobic proteins and electrostatic forces on the mucosal surface, NCs can pass through the mucus layer quickly. Justin Hanes's group first proposed the concept of mucus\npenetrating particles (MPPs).56 An increasing number of studies have shown that muco-inert strategies can also achieve rapid mucus penetration by an increasing number of NCs. This is based on the common properties of NCs with a small size that are densely coated with mucus-inert materials.55\nOn the basis of successfully improving the systemic circulation time and reducing immunogenicity, the effect of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on the fate of systemic delivery NCs has been widely studied.57 Here, we pay special attention to the ability of long PEG chains to effectively overcome biological barriers in gastrointestinal drug delivery. PEG contains many hydroxyl groups, and as a hydrophilic electroneutral polymer, it is also the most concerning muco-inert material. In a study, it was found that the diffusion rate of PEGylated NPs in fresh human cervicovaginal mucus was only eight times slower than that in water, while that of unmodified NPs was more than 12 000 times slower.58 Thus, the PEGylated NPs were proven to effectively increase the availability of drugs.\nRapid penetration into mucus is based on the fact that there is enough mucus inertness on the surface of the NC, so it is particularly important to consider and optimize the formulation. The molecular weight and addition amount of PEG determines whether the NC has effective mucus inertness. It has been found that NPs coated with low molecular weight (2–5 kD) PEG can permeate quickly in human mucus.59 Lateral comparison of mucus penetration by oral PEG-2k, PEG-6k and PEG-10k NPs in rats proved that PEG with low molecular weight (< 10 kD) had a better effect.60 However, another study compared PEG-5k, PEG-10k, PEG-20k and PEG-40k and found that high molecular weight PEG (40 kD) still had good mucus diffusion.61 These results suggest that the molecular weight of PEG may not need to be as small as possible to increase the penetration ability, so the selection of the molecular weight range of hydrophilic polymers\nneeds more evaluation. On the other hand, by quantifying PEG5k with different surface densities and evaluating the effects on mucin binding, it has been proven that at least 5% PEG-5k is needed to effectively shield the interaction between the NPs and mucus components.62 Therefore, a certain molecular weight range and high coating density are the basis for these kinds of mucus penetrating systems.\nMany new muco-inert materials have been developed to replace the role of PEG. It has been reported that Pluronic F127modified NPs and liposomes can promote transmucosal delivery for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease or viral infection,63–65 and mucus inertness is due to the two hydrophilic PEG arms on the polypropylene oxide core of the Pluronic. Similarly, rectal administration of a Pluronic F127-coated nanosuspension resulted in favorable mucus inertness because it avoided the capture of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of rectal mucus.66,67 In addition, it was reported that the incorporation of Pluronic F127 into liposomes could improve the stability and enhance the sustained release performance.68 The enhanced rigidity of the lipid membrane helped to maintain the integrity of the carrier during mucus permeation, and this effect was also observed in PEG-modified liposomes.69 Poly(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (pHPMA), a polymer material that has been used as a chemotherapeutic drug loading carrier in the past, has also been used in mucus-inert systems for the first time to replace PEG coatings.70 Due to its special ability to gradually dissociate from carriers in mucus, pHPMA also has great potential in the construction of NCs with separated core-shell structures (this will be discussed later).\nIt is worth noting that the changed mucus dynamics change not only the longitudinal distribution from the mucus to the epithelium but also the horizontal distribution in the gastrointestinal tract. PEGylated NPs have shown a better retention time\nand longer migration distance in the gastrointestinal tract. The in vivo imaging of mice treated with oral PEG-NPs showed that not only the expected longer fluorescence time was achieved but also stronger fluorescence signals from the distal colon tissue were obtained.71 Therefore, in addition to permeability, the gastrointestinal distribution of the mucus-inert system still needs more attention."

      "heading" : "Mucolytic penetration",
      "text" : "High cross-linking between mucins has been widely recognized as the key factor in penetration prevention. Mucolytic systems, which are modified by functional molecules, can destroy the cross-linked structure locally to make it easier for the molecule to pass through and extend its retention time. At present, there are few studies on the mucolytic system, and the main methods include disulfide bond cleavage and mucin hydrolysis.\nThe disulfide breaking agent can be incorporated into the NCs together with the drug and released slowly when passing through the mucus. Reported disulfide breaking agents include Nacetylcysteine, N-dodecyl-4-mercaptobutylamide and 2- mercapto-N-octylacetamide.72 These agents significantly reduce the viscosity of the mucus, thus speeding up the penetration of the drug. However, lower viscosity cannot immediately be reversed by removal of the agent, which may potentially cause pathogen invasion and mucosal dysfunction.54\nProteolytic enzymes can be coupled to NCs to accelerate permeation by continuously hydrolyzing mucin fibers. Mucin lyases, including papain, bromelain and trypsin, have been reported tomodifyNPs73,74 and the self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS),75–77 and improved mucus diffusion has been observed. The permeability of papain- and bromelainfunctionalized NPs in porcine intestinal mucus was 3 times greater than that of unmodifiedNPs, and trypsin-coupledNPswere 2 times greater.54 The main work of the mucosal layer is the protection of the underlying epithelial cells, but a limited degree of local damage to the mucus may not have a significant negative effect, which has been discussed in detail in the review byMenzel et al.78 The typical mucus penetrating materials were summarized in Table 4.\nSurface strategies for transmucosal delivery\nEpithelium of GIT is located under the mucosal barrier and plays the role of the last barrier that hinders drug entry into\ncirculation. After reaching the surface of the epithelium, whose pH is almost neutral,9 drugs can no longer demand the protective effect of NCs against digestion. However, drugs which need to be absorbed by the whole body such as insulin, nucleic acids and so on, have to enter systemic circulation by passing through the epithelial barrier, including epithelial cells and tight junctions. Therefore, surface strategies need to enhance transmucosal barrier capacity."

      "heading" : "Epithelial transport pathways",
      "text" : "The main components of the epithelium include intestinal epithelial cells responsible for absorption, M cells and a small number of goblet cells that secrete mucus. Absorbing epithelial cells are the main place that absorbs water and soluble substances (drugs, ions, sugars, lipids, peptides, amino acids, etc.).79 NCs in the lumen can enter the cell through the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cell and then discharge from the basolateral membrane into the extracellular space or promote drug enter the extracellular space through an open tight junction. Finally, The NCs or drug can enter the extraintestinal lymphatic systemor blood circulation (Figure 3). Generally, larger particles (ranging from hundreds nanometers to 10microns, and also affected by the radius of curvature of the particles) are more likely to be absorbed by phagocytes through phagocytosis, thus may reduce the chance of being internalized by epithelial cells.80 Smaller particles tend to enter epithelial cells through pinocytosis or passively infiltrate cell membranes (such as cell-penetrating peptides and small-size metal cluster molecules) through non-endocytosis. This facilitates intactly transmucosal efficiency of NCs. Surface strategies to promote epithelial uptake, including modification of various penetration enhancers, polymers, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and targeting ligands, are summarized in Table 5. For example, chitosan is also a typical polymer absorption enhancer. Studies have shown that chitosan NPs promote the internalization of epithelium cells and Payer's patch where mucus cover is thin, which is mediated by cellular adsorptive endocytosis.81 The application of penetration enhancers such as Tween 80-reinforced liposomes, significantly enhanced the absorption of (+)-catechin following oral administration with increased area under the curve (AUC) and prolonged mean residence time (MRT).82 It should be noted that the process of cell lipids changing under the effects of surface active substances is irreversible, which requires strict dose control. After being coupled with CPP, N-trimethyl-N-dodecyl chitosan NPs increased cellular uptake and transcellular transport,\nand induced a more significant hypoglycemic effect (about lowering 40% blood glucose) in Bama mini-pigs model.83 The pharmacokinetic results showed that AUC and Cmax were respectively increased by 1.45 times and 1.82 times. Currently, the mechanisms of endocytosis and CPP s’ internalization have been relatively well studied and can refer to these literatures.84,85 In contrast, the mechanisms of transcytosis are not as well understood.\nThese enhanced epithelial transports are also partially attributed to Peyer aggregating lymph nodes (Peyer's patches). The Peyer's patches, enriched in M cells (or ‘microfold’ cells), are an important absorption site that mediate intact absorption of NCs in intestinal epithelium. M cells are specialized epithelial cells responsible for sampling particles such as bacteria, viruses and antigens in the intestinal contents and then delivering them to the lymphoid tissues under the epithelium.86,87 Because M cells do not express the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, they avoid firstpass metabolism and the efflux effects of other intestinal cells. Moreover, M cells have a relatively thin mucous membrane covering and high transcellular activity. These physiological characteristics enable the NCs to be absorbed by the M cells and thus enter the lymphatic system easily.79 However, M cells can only sample a small amount of antigenic substances in gastrointestinal immunity, which greatly reduces the possibility\nof NC uptake. This mechanism may have a relatively small restriction on the NCs loaded with vaccines, which can still induce sufficient mucosal and systemic immune responses by targeting C5a receptors on M cells.88 ,89 In addition, M cells can be targeted by lectin-modified surfaces, which bind to specific carbohydrate residues present on the surfaces of M cells with high affinity, such as α-L-fucose residues.90 It should be noted is that the experimental results obtained from M cells of animals may be different from those in human beings because Peyer's patch densities in the intestines of some common experimental animals is much greater than that in humans (accounting for only approximately 1% of all epithelial cells in the lumen),91 and we should not overestimate the role of Peyer’s patch density in the absence of sufficient evidence. In addition, when transferred to the lymphatic system through M cells or other pathways, NCs also encounter a large number of local macrophages. The NCs may be engulfed by these cells, so their subsequent fate is still uncertain.\nAnother important pathway is tight junction-mediated paracellular transport. Tight junctions are firmly attached between epithelial cells and the adjacent cells, which act to fix the cells and prevent substances from penetrating. Tight junctions are consists of claudins, occludin, tricellulin, and functional adhesion molecules and peripheral membrane scaffold proteins (such as ZO-1),92 and can be opened by regulatory related proteins.93 Typical methods are summarized in Table 5. The proper opening of tight junctions, without complete destruction, can help drug transport through the paracellular pathway.94 This is another important pathway in addition to transcellular transport. However, even if it is opened to the greatest extent, the maximum gap is still less than 20 nm, making it difficult for NPs to pass through.95 Therefore, delivery will depend on release of payload. Chitosan and its derivatives are widely considered to promote the opening of tight junctions and absorption.96 However, a study has shown that this effect may be limited by the protonation of chitosan94 because the epithelial surface is nearly neutral, and soluble derivatives will be needed to provide a wider range of adaptation. In addition, absorbents such as bile salts, surfactants and fatty acids are also considered to be able to open tight junctions to a certain extent. Recent studies have shown that some peptides can also act as tight junction regulators.97 In the established co-culture model of the intestinal epithelial cell line and blood-brain barrier, the peptides ADT-6, HAV-6, C-CPE, PN-159, a 7-mer (FDFWITP, PN-78) and AT-1002 at non-toxic concentrations were studied. They have been shown to reversibly regulate tight junctions and effectively open the paracellular pathway of fluorescein and albumin. The role and targeting mechanism of PN-159 have been further elucidated in a recent study,98 providing a promising modification method."

      "text" : "Commonly used CPPs, including HIV-1Tat, penetratin, oligoarginine, MAP, and R8, have good transepithelial ability and are usually applied to promote cellular internalization by covalent binding or physical mixing with NCs.129,130 However, CPPs carry a large number of cationic groups, and the interaction with mucin can weaken the fluidity in the mucus,131 which will reduce the chances of reaching the epithelium. The combination of CPPs and a negative charge carrier or coating material can reduce capture by mucus and overcome the two barriers at the same time. Mesoporous silicon nanoparticles (MSNPs) carry opposite negative charges,132 and CPPs can bind to PEGylated MSNPs by electrostatic interactions to obtain the multiproperties surface of mucus inertness and cell penetration.133 Compared with the unmodified carrier, their cell uptake, exocytosis and final transcellular penetration increased by 8.45-fold, 1.62-fold and 5.09-fold, respectively; their pharmacodynamics increased by 5.41-fold in vitro and 4.91-fold in vivo. This method was also inspired by the molecular exchange\nbetween the intestinal flora and host cells. In the intestinal tract, host epithelial cells maintain a high uptake of intestinal microbial metabolites (mostly short-chain fatty acids) in the outer layer of the mucus, of which butyrate is the main substance. Innovatively, this hydrophilic flora metabolite butyrate, which was used to replace CPPs, could be anchored on the surface of PEG NPs. After loading insulin, this system induced a high hypoglycemic response and relative bioavailability in diabetic rats.134 These methods successfully enhanced the transcellular ability of mucoinert NCs. However, there is no evidence that shows that the hydrophilic groups do not have adverse effects on the transmembrane efficiency of this kind of carrier, which requires further evaluation."

      "text" : "Dissociable surfaces help to reduce the side effects of hydrophilic groups because they do not follow the NCs to reach epithelial cells. When the dissociable core-shell nanostructure passes through the mucus layer, the hydrophilic shell gradually dissociates, and then the transmucosal core is exposed. pHPMA, a polymer carrier material that has been used for many years, has recently been proven to be a kind of muco-inert coating material that can dissociate over time. After the gradual dissociation of pHPMA-coated CPP-NPs, oral insulin bioavailability has been improved135 (Figure 4). Its retention time in the intestine can be further increased by the addition of sulfhydryl groups on pHPMA.131 MSNPs coated with vulcanized pHPMA still had good apparent permeability in the everted intestinal sac,\nand the core-shell nanostructure labelled by FITC/TRITC showed obvious dissociation and intestinal cell internalization. The contradiction between adhesion and penetration has not been observed, and this can be explained by the dissociation effect of pHPMA. Moreover, chitosan and its derivatives effectively promote the transport of drugs across cellular and paracellular pathways136; thus, they can act in a similar manner to the CPP core, including directly wrapping the drug137 and modifying the MSNPs138 to form a cell-penetrating core."

      "text" : "The interaction between particle surface charge and the mucus/epithelium has been widely recognized for a long time.139 Recently, the strategy of variable surface potential has been applied to assist in delivery in the mucus-epithelial barrier. Bernkop-Schnurch's team proposed a phosphorylation strategy of variable surface potential and successfully developed polyphosphate NPs, chitosan micelles and self-emulsifying systems.140–142 The cationic core of their carrier is protected by an anionic group in the form of a phosphate, which can be hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP). ALP is a kind of cell surface glycoprotein in the intestines, lungs, vagina and many other organs. Phosphate is decomposed after contact with ALP, triggering the zeta potential to change from negative to neutral or positive. The initially negatively charged surface can avoid interacting with the negatively charged mucin, and then the increasing positive charge will enhance the affinity with the cell membrane and prevent back-diffusion. As an example, phosphorylated chitosan micelles have the positive charge of chitosan, which is masked as a negative charge by the phosphate. After being exposed to ALP, the surface potential can change from negative to neutral. As a result, the carrier has approximately 6-fold higher mucus permeability than positively charged micelles and a higher cell association rate than Caco-2 cells treated with phosphatase inhibitors.141\nSurface strategies for responsive delivery\nGenerally, the design of surface strategies depends on the different therapeutic purposes, in view of the differences of absorption windows and treatment regions in GIT (Table 6). Although mucus- and epithelial-based strategies have significantly enhanced efficiency, action sites are still non-specific. At\npresent, responsive surface strategies have been designed to achieve directional delivery through stimulus response or degradation kinetics."

      "text" : "Prolonged drug retention time and a sustained drug release profile in the stomach are desired for local gastric diseases such as gastritis, gastric ulcer and gastric carcinoma, or for meeting the absorption sites of certain drugs (such as sulpiride) in the upper GIT, which both mean formulations that respond to gastric environment become an important design strategy. The gastric floating strategy can effectively prolong its retention time and improve oral availability. However, the retention time of the conventional gastric floating system depends on continuous filling of the stomach.144 In fact, nano-sized carriers can not only help absorption but also have more joint mechanisms to improve retention, which is a considerable advantage. Due to the rapid emptying time and the high protonation state of gastric juice, gastric-responsive delivery will mainly depend on the retention mechanism of mucus responsive or response strategies for strong acid.\nIt has been reported that approximately 2/5 of the total thickness in the stomach is occupied by the firmly adherent layer,11 and this proportion is much higher than other segments of the stomach and intestine. Many studies have shown that mucus delivery strategies can achieve enhanced retention, especially in stomach, because NCs accumulate there first and have full contact with gastric mucus before emptying. Adhesive chitosan-PLGA NPs have passively shown priority gastric adhesion.145 By transmission electron microscopy, a large number of NPs were observed in the stomachs of rats 8 h after intragastric administration, while the uncoated NPs were only observed in the duodenum at the same time (Figure 5). The treatment results showed that diosmin-loaded NPs significantly relieved gastric mucosal injury.\nHighmolecular weightmaterials such as Eudragit are a series of acrylic resins that have been widely used as coating materials for gastrointestinal controlled release preparations (Table 7). Eudragit E100 in response to an acidic environment (insoluble in water, but swelling occurs when the pH is less than 5) has been used to coat chitosan/polyphosphate lipid composite NPs. Different from the single traditional mechanism, these NPs present a combination of various gastric retention mechanisms, including swelling effects,\nhigh density, and mucus adhesion. Gastric acid-responsive swelling can resist the exclusion of pyloric sphincters; a higher density leads to sedimentation, which retains NPs in the folds, walls and antrum near the pylorus of the gastric body and resists gastric peristalsis; adhesion mechanisms improve these effects. As a result, longer retention times and slower sustained drug release than the commercially available preparation Madopar® HBS capsules was observed.146,147 In addition, the protonation of\ncarboxyl groups on Eudragit L100 at low pH could confer the chitosan-based formulations with appropriate stability in the stomach that did not easily dissolve in the gastric environment and impede the release of encapsulated drugs. Therefore, it can also be used to further protect the chitosan-based carriers under the condition of mucus turnover time of up to 6 hours."

      "heading" : "Small intestine response",
      "text" : "The small intestine has a thin mucus layer, a large surface area and rich villi, and it provides the most suitable environment for absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. In one case, safe oral formulations directed to the intestine have been successfully used to improve the bioavailability of easily degraded peptide drugs such as insulin, exendin-4 and calcitonin. Alternatively, the treatment of some systematic diseases such as diabetes and nervous system diseases usually needs high absorption of drugs in the intestine with low adverse effects.4 Specific small intestine segments are more beneficial to the absorption of certain drugs. In a study of situ closure of the intestinal ring in rats, the regional absorption of insulin with the help of CPP was determined. The order of the insulin AUC coadministered with L-penetratin was ileum> jejunum>duodenum>colon. In contrast, the AUC order\nafter coadministration of insulin with D-penetratin was colon>duodenum≥jejunum and ileum.148 The results showed significant differences in intestinal segment absorption (Figure 6), which prompted the importance of proper intestinal absorption regions. Non-specific adhesion or penetration systems have difficulty locating to intestinal regions, so intestinal oriented delivery depends more on pH-sensitivity.\nThe mucosal layer of the duodenum and jejunum is the thinnest, and the pH of their luminal fluid is between that of the stomach and distal intestine. Thus, it is required to perform both strong acidic resistance and weak acidic response for the NCs. The alkyl chain-grafted pseudopeptide PLP-NDA18 contains 18 mol% decylamine (NDA). PLP-NDA18 is a comb-like amphiphilic polymer that exhibits extremely high membrane activity at a specific pH.149 At the typical slightly acidic pH of 5.0-6.0 in the duodenum and jejunum, PLP-NDA18 destabilizes cell membranes, thus facilitating payload translocation. A nanohydrogel was developed based on this, and it can cleverly promote absorption in the duodenum and jejunum. Around 60% of hydrophobic payloads were released from the PLP-NDA18 nanogel in FaSSIF within the first 5 hours. Considering that the average time of human intestinal transition is approximately 3-4 hours, the release rate was sufficient for intestinal delivery.150 Polymers such as hypromellose phthalate (HPMCP) and the\nEudragit L100-55 have been used as enteric coating materials. They are stable and insoluble in strongly acidic conditions (pH≤ 5.5), so they are suitable as a NC coating in response to the pH of the duodenum and jejunum. These polymers can coat on the surface by spray drying technology, and the reported nanovesicular spanlastic dispersions and nanocubosomal dispersions can trigger the exposure of the inner layer by the pH of the duodenum.151 , 152 Peyer's patches are abundant in ileum epithelial cells,153 and the tight junctions are relatively loose, so ileum delivery is of great significance for peptide and protein macromolecular drugs. However, the ileum pH need a response to weak alkaline that the common acid-response coating cannot meet; thus, some new methods are required. After modification with L-cysteine hydrochloride by thiolation, the pH response of HPMCP was adjusted from 5.5 to 7.4. Thiolation also improved mucoadhesive property of HPMCP to prolong the particles transit time, and successfully induced strong antibody mediated immune responses by releasing loaded M cell targeting antigen in ileum pH.154 PLGA NPs (200 nm) were coated with Eudragit S100 (∼240 nm) to be used for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment. In vitro release studies demonstrated the presence of polymer coating decreased the release rate of drug in acidic pH, increasing NPs stability in the stomach.155 In addition, due to the relative enrichment of M cells in the ileum,\nM cell-targeting ligands (for example, some lectins) can also trigger concentrated absorption in the ileum. Lectins are the most broadly investigated category of M cell-targeting molecules, which bind to specific carbohydrate residues present on the surfaces of M cells with high affinity, such as α-L-fucose residues.90,156 However, some problems with M cells may lead to low efficiency, including mucus cover, low sampling volume and the fact that M cells account for only 1% of the total epithelial cells, whose effects require more evaluation."

      "heading" : "Colon response",
      "text" : "As the intestinal segment that is the most prone to inflammation and cancer, colon has attracted substantial local treatments. Compared with stomach and small intestine, colon is located at the distal end of the gastrointestinal tract, with a nearneutral pH value, lower digestive enzyme activity and higher levels of microorganisms amount,157 ,158 and has a lower destructive effect on released drug.\nIn view of the physiological and pathological characteristics, some strategies have been developed, including aspects of response to pH, mucus, time or microbial degradation, and active targeted modification. On the one hand, healthy colon has a relatively stable intestinal environment, which can provide the necessary conditions for pH-sensitive strategies. Due to the colonic pH is close to neutral, the use of polymer materials such as the enteric Eudragit L/S series, pH-sensitive materials such as chitosan and its derivatives or their combination can improve the possibility of drug delivery to the colon.159 ,160 A covalently bonded Eudragit S-100 and chitosan based colon-specific NPs were fabricated for colorectal cancers.161 The release kinetics shows a burst release with almost 20% of the drug being released in the first 30 min at pH 7.4, as compared to almost 5% drug release at pH 4.5, and almost 56% of the drug is released at neutral pH. Moreover, another novel pH triggered method has been reported.162,163 In these researches, succinylated depsilonpolylysine or poly(acrylic acid) was coated on the orifice of drug-loaded mesoporous silica as a pH-sensitive nano-gate. It only opened and released drugs within the range of colonic pH, which effectively avoided early release. On the other hand, pathological colon is also important to some passively or actively targeted NCs. If there is inflammation or cancer in the colon, it can cause size-dependent NCs enrichment. Particles within 10 microns have been observed to accumulate in the area of colonic\nulcers, and the smaller the particles, the more deposits.164 Stronger mucus adhesion induced by pathology could bring more opportunities to the adhesive delivery system, which tend to enhance the specificity of colonic adhesion. Also, in inflamed tissue, due to the activated macrophages highly express CD98, mannose receptor, galactose lectin and transferrin receptor, the corresponding molecules can be conjugated to NCs to achieve active targeting (examples can be seen in Table 8165).166\nMany pH-responsive NCs can improve the targeted distribution in the colon. However, the colon is in the posterior segment of the intestine, and the pH is also between the jejunum and ileum; thus, the effective load is likely to be released in advance. Time-dependent strategies can avoid this situation to some extent. This can be achieved by adding the Eudragit RS100 coating, which expands and releases drugs after gradual erosion. Coated NPs significantly improved the drug release in upper gastrointestinal tract, prolonged the duration of drug-plasma concentration in rats and observed significant enrichment of therapeutic agent budesonide in colon.167 Moreover, another method is based on the highest flora content of colon. The total amount of colonic flora (1011-1012 CFU/mL), which is several orders of magnitude higher than the rest of the segments (101- 103 CFU/mL in stomach and duodenum, 104-107 CFU/mL in jejunum and ileum) of GIT,168 provides a reliable microbialresponsive mechanism. Polymer molecules such as alginate can be slowly degraded by the combined action of rich microflora and a variety of enzymes. In the study, degradation rate of the alginate-carboxymethyl cellulose complex prepared by different formulations was tested under the condition of colonic microflora which were extracted and cultured from human feces, and the results showed a favorable degradation and the degradation rate can be further regulated with the ratio of alginate-carboxymethyl cellulose.169 Another study showed that alginate-chitosan hydrogel containing dextran–fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled NPs only collapsed in the colon, and the inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide were reduced compared with exposed to NPs alone,170 suggests a favorable colonic flora –trigger effect.\nIntestine response with multi-layers\nIn order to develop more efficient gastrointestinal response NCs, dual- or multi-response strategies have been used for optimization, which could combine improved payload\nprotection, absorption and targeting into a single NC. The basic method of multi-layer coating, which was originally worked out for the preparation of multi-layered nanostructures on flat macroscopic or colloidal surfaces, is also called electrostatic self-assembly.171 It has been widely applied to NCs, including nanogels, polymer NPs and lipid carriers.172,173 This modular drug delivery tool can achieve diversified functions by sequentially depositing surface materials on the charged core.174 For example, carriers based on positively charged chitosan can be electrostatically assembled to cover the surface with a layer of negatively charged carboxymethyl chitosan to overcome cell membrane rupture.173 ,175\nA typical application is to provide multi-mechanism for promoting the intestinal absorption of peptide and protein drugs. A four-layer system of insulin-PLGA-chitosan-sodium alginate from the inside to the outside (Figure 7) was reported, which achieved enhanced intestinal absorption and a continuous hypoglycemic effect.176 In this system, PLGA not only has the function of adhesion but also slows down the absorption of sugar in the intestinal tract. Sodium alginate is coated on the chitosan layer due to its electrostatic action, and it can be firm and compact in solutions with low pH values, enabling a stable\nstructure in the stomach and protecting it against enzymatic deactivation; then, it becomes loose in intestinal fluid with nearly neutral pH. The acid-resistant shell dissociates after entering the intestine, and then chitosan triggers enhanced transmembrane transport. The system has a greater pH-sensitivity of the layers with the turning point near pH = 5, and according to the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic studies, the significant hypoglycemic effect was observed only 1 h after gavage, and insulin was continually released for at least 6 h.\nAnother important application is to induce a superposed targeting effect. Intestinal cancer is an important concern of chemotherapy. It usually has a high incidence and is accompanied by severe mucus abnormalities and inflammatory lesions; thus, delivery that relies only on the role of targeted ligands may be limited. In a study, a highly selective oral drug delivery system for colon cancer cells was developed.177 Folic acidtocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate adducts (FA-TPGS) and octadecyl alcohol-modified dextran (OCT-Dex) were used to modify superparamagnetic iron oxide NP-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles layer by layer. OCT-Dex can only be hydrolyzed by colon-specific glucanase, and FA-TPGS enables the targeting of NPs to FA receptor-overexpressing cancer cells. Then, the\nNPs can be further activated by a high-frequency magnetic field for controlled release. The colloidal stability was more than 8 h in stomach, small intestine or colon, and responded sensitively to a variety of conditions (complete glucan enzymolysis within 4 h, enhanced cellular uptake of the NPs by FA receptor-mediated endocytosis, and appreciable temperature elevation of ca 14 °C after 7 minutes alternating magnetic field-induced hyperthermia) and has been proven to have a significant effect on the tumor growth of in situ tumor-bearing mice in vivo.\nMulti-layer systems formed by electrostatic self-assembly have great potential in intestine-responsive delivery. However, relatively complex systems may have structural stability problems and difficulties in transforming into clinical applications. Therefore, how to make a single surface compatible with richer necessary functions still needs more attention and technological breakthroughs."

However, this brings difficulties to the experimental evaluation of surface strategies.\nHighly protonated environment and digestive enzymes in gastrointestinal juice can promote stability changes of NCs and further cause drug leakage. After 30 min was incubated with 1% chitosan coated liposomes in artificial gastric juice, about 80% of the embedded FITC-marker was retained, but only about 30% was retained after 2 h,178 which indicates a significant impact on the final pharmacokinetics and bioavailability results of experiments. Bile salts in intestinal juice may make it harder to maintain the stability of drugs and NCs. Bile salts are produced by oxidation of cholesterol in the liver, stored in the gallbladder and slowly excreted into the intestinal cavity.179 In liposomes formulations, lipids (such as DMPC) with low phase-transition temperatures are prone to leakage under the erosion of bile salts.180 In addition to being absorbed in their complete form,181\nNCs containing artificial or natural lipids can form a mixed micelle with remaining lipids from destroyed fragments and repermeate the intestinal epithelial cells.182 In addition, cholate has been reported to interact with NC surfaces. For example, gold NPs coated with β-lactoglobulin will change the interface composition, protein corona and structure because of adsorption, which lead to the lower level of delivery efficiency.183\nThe harsh environment affects the stability of carriers even before they come into contact with gastrointestinal mucus and cells, leading to the premature denaturation of NCs.184 This makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the experimental results and whether they are from the original form of the NCs. Moreover, proteins and molecules from foods, gastrointestinal cells or microorganisms can cause similar problems if they adsorb onto NCs to form coronas."

      "text" : "It has been proven that the optimization of surface properties, including material type, particle size and potential can promote the interaction between drugs and cells or mucus components and enhance drug delivery.185,186 However, these characteristics are also the factors to aggregation and corona adsorption of NPs, which could change the surface properties and reduce the performance of the carrier (such as targeting and biological barrier crossing efficiency), and further reduce the representativeness of the experimental findings.\nSpontaneous adsorption between NPs can lead to the formation of aggregates into larger clumps, and it has been proven in recent studies, such as with chitosan NPs, whose agglomeration was observed during the small intestinal phase.187 Aggregation significantly changes particle size and surface potential chitosan NPs formed 18-fold larger agglomerates (~30 μm, ~ -10 mV) of its initial average particle size(~2 μm, ~20 mV), and a slight but significant (10%, p<0.01) increase in cytotoxicity was observed. Toxicity profiles may be influenced by the aggregates size, other research also found a substantial decrease in hemolytic toxicity with an increase in size of silver nanoparticle agglomerates (from 43 nm to 1400 nm).188 Moreover, considering it has been found that small-sized particles (100 nm) are more easily uptake by caco-2 cells than large-sized particles (200, 500 or 1000 nm),189,190 aggregates are prone to lower the NP’s cellular uptake. For example, 25% decreased uptake of aggregated gold NPs has been observed in HeLa and A549 cells compared with monodisperse gold NPs.191 Commonly, NCs with a higher surface charge are considered to suspend in simple media more stably because electrostatic repulsion can maintain good dispersion. However, if under pH values close to their isoelectric point or point of zero charge, NPs will have a near-neutral net surface charge.5 Different acidic gastrointestinal fluids can provide these conditions, and interparticle repulsion will consequently be reduced, enhancing the effects of attraction and encouraging NP aggregation.192\nWhen NCs are introduced into the complex biological environment, they will also interact with the molecules encountered and be wrapped in layers, the most important of which is the formation of the protein corona. Amphoteric proteins have strong affinity and can be adsorbed layer by layer,\nand the corona of charged NCs is usually thicker than neutral proteins.193 Surface properties, including surface charge, can change the formation of the protein corona, but some studies have shown that particle size may have no significant effect on it.194 The biosorption of NCs to proteins may mediate serious consequences, which can mask initial surface properties, weaken the targeting effect and activate the immune response.195 The influence of protein canopy on cell behavior and immunology has been extensively studied. After absorbing different protein coronas, the reformed surface will replace the original surface and become a more important factor in terms of cell uptake behaviour.196 In terms of immunotoxicity, a deformation of the protein tertiary structure (promoted by the interaction with the curved NPs surface) that can induce protein aggregation or make self-proteins immunogenic, thereby inducing autoimmune reactions197 or that antigens can be absorbed on to NPs becoming more immunogenic.198 Moreover, recognition to adsorbed protein or the surface of the NPs by opsonins and proteins of the complement system can also trigger an immune response.199 In addition, both spontaneous aggregation and protein corona significantly increase the particle size which may cause negative effects as for larger particles were tend to be internalized by phagocytes than epithelial cells.\nIn fact, a typical feature of GIT is the high amount of mucin, thus it is likely to form the mucin corona and has been observed in recent study.200 The phenomenon of clusters were confirmed by transmission electron microscope photos and fluorescence signals, and the aggregates may stick together to form a larger\nscale (Figure 8), which resulted in a decrease in the transport of NPs across intestinal cells. Further research for the mechanism of lower transport efficiency found that though the mucin corona induces more endocytosis of intestinal epithelial cells for PEGmodified gold NPs, the retrograde pathway enhances in cells at the same time.200 For mucus-mediated transport, adhesive NCs have strong interaction with the mucin. The mucin coronaadsorbed citrus pectinate-chitosan NPs were observed a decrease in the zeta potential related to mucin concentration, and an increase in hydrodynamic radii from 218.1 ( ± 4.9) nm to 291.7 ( ± 7.8) nm upon exposure to mucin.201 But there have been no similar report for muco-penetrating system still. In addition to mucin, there are other abundant sources of protein in the gastrointestinal tract, such as microbes and food. These may induce a mixed corona formed by as many as hundreds of proteins. It is encouraging to note that although the negative effects have not been addressed, the protein corona is being added to the formula to facilitate delivery due to its positive effects. For example, similar to the dissociable core-shell nanostructures discussed, protein corona liposomes (cationic liposomes that have adsorbed bovine serum albumin) have two different surface properties. The outer layer of bovine serum albumin is used to shield the capture of mucins, which can be partially dissociated as it passes through the mucus layer and then exposes the surface of cationic lipids to promote transepithelial interaction; NPs formed by an apolipoprotein E corona have also been reported to improve the loading capacity of therapeutic agents.203"

      "text" : "Most gastrointestinal diseases, including ulcers, tumors, infections and inflammatory diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), cause significant changes in gastrointestinal physiology. The physiology and pathological states show a dynamic process to an uncertain degree. Many precisely designed deliveries can achieve good results in in vitro simulation, but it is hard to cope with the dynamic gastrointestinal environment in vivo, and the contradictionwill be further aggravated by individual differences. For example, the pH value of the colon is relatively stable at 6.8 at the proximal end and 7.2 at the distal end204; however, the pH in patients with ulcerative colitis can range from 2.3 to 5.5.205 This contributes to the considerable challenges faced by colonic pH-responsive delivery.\nMore aspects have been observed. The changes to different degrees can be briefly summarized as intestinal transport, pH value, mucus, microorganisms, mucosal epithelial cell permeability and immune cell enrichment.1,165 Compared with the physiological four-hour oral-cecal transport time (the time food takes tomove from the mouth to the cecum), this time has been shown to be delayed in patients with inflammatory enteritis but reduced in the case of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.206 Under inflammation, the total mucus thickness of the colon and rectum may decrease, but the gastrointestinal mucus shows a large amount of secretion and rapid renewal.9 Therefore, under combined actions, the expected results of distribution and absorption may not be achieved, especially in some passively targeted delivery systems, such as adhesion and timedependent carriers.\nIn addition, whether with malignant transformation or inflammation, mucin has shown changes in glycosylation.207 The changes in the degree of sulfation and sialylation and the length of the oligosaccharide chains reduce the viscoelasticity of mucus and its resistance to bacterial invasion and attachment.208 For example, the stomach was once thought to be sterile, but it was later found that pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori may still exist under the mucus. The mutual promotion between the development of inflammation and gastrointestinal microbial colonization has also been proven.209 This effect leads to further disorders of gastrointestinal physiology. Moreover, changes in the structure and amount of microflora can also lead to reduced reliability of flora-dependent NCs, such as dextran- or alginate-based carriers triggered by colonic flora.\nNot all cases are disadvantageous, and some pathological changes contribute to delivery. Destruction of the epithelium leads to the exposure of eosinophil cationic protein and transferrin,1 which allows the inflammatory tissues to be more effectively targeted by the anion delivery system. On the other hand, even if the possibility of inducing side effects increases,210 changes in intestinal permeability and enrichment of immune cells can increase the chances of uptake. Therefore, the pathological GIT is both challenging and opportunistic."

      "heading" : "Conclusion and discussion",
      "text" : "Different from intravenous injection or other parenteral administrations, gastrointestinal NCs have encountered unique\nbiological barriers and delivery challenges. Overcoming the biological barrier for effective absorption and enhancing the local delivery of the GIT has become a prerequisite for more local or systemic utilization of oral drugs. Here, we review the methods of adaption to gastrointestinal protection mechanisms. First, the NC itself forms a kind of protection for drugs; second, NCs should be able to resist gastrointestinal motility and mucus renewal, which requires adhesion or rapid penetration; third, NCs need to enter the epithelial cells to be absorbed or further transport into circulation, and at the same time, provide strategies to achieve mucus-epithelium delivery; and finally, according to the drug demand, NCs are expected to obtain specific distribution through the response to the characteristics of different gastrointestinal segments.\nAlthough a considerable number of gastrointestinal adaptive oral NCs have been successful, few have entered industrial production and clinical use. There are two possible reasons for this in addition to the discussed challenges of surface strategies. On the one hand, the drug fate with oral administration is still not completely clear, and efficiency needs to be improved. Although some studies have preliminarily proven intact uptake, the problems of uptake dose and early drug exposure still exist. On the other hand, the combined effects of multiple gastrointestinal obstacles are difficult to overcome at the same time. Complex multi-functional carriers will have difficulty meeting the needs of industrialization and the clinic. The contradiction requires the carrier design to be weighed carefully. Most studies in recent years have focused on surface coating and ligand modification and its effect in vivo. However, the study of the mechanism and the evaluation of gastrointestinal factors acting with carriers need to be more in-depth. We expect that this review will help to understand the adaptation mechanism of NCs in response to gastrointestinal protective components and the efforts that have been made."

    "abstractText" : "Nano-carriers (NCs) provide drugs with protective and oriented strategies. Despite their success in parenteral administration, NCs still need to be optimized to meet the more serious obstacles encountered in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The main defense mechanisms include renewing mucus, epithelial obstacles and digestion by GIT segments. These hurdles pose challenges even before NCs target molecules or proteins, which has often led to unsatisfactory delivery efficiency. Therefore, a critical focus is the exemption from negative effects of GIT. A series of adapted NCs have been designed based on surface strategies to form an expected distribution and increase gastrointestinal utilization. In this paper, we review the strategies and efforts of NCs to adapt to gastrointestinal defense components, including the mucus, epithelium and gastrointestinal segments; the related gastrointestinal mechanisms and functions are also summarized synchronously. Last, we discuss the delivery challenges in terms of physiopathological GIT and surface properties of the NCs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
