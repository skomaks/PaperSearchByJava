However, they fail relatively easily under flexural loading due to the weak nature of the interface between the carbon-fiber and epoxy. In the current study, the desizing and oxidation treatment of carbon fibers and the coating of graphene nano-platelets (GNPs) on the carbon-fibers has been done with an aim to strengthen the interface/ interphase between the fiber and the matrix. GNPs were coated on the carbon fibers before making the final laminates through vacuum assisted resin transfer molding. The flexural strength of the laminates has been found to improve significantly with GNP addition. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy have been used to examine the nature of interface/interphase between the fiber and the matrix as well as the mechanism of failure of the composite."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "High specific strength and stiffness have made carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites one of the most commonly used material systems for a range of structural applications [1]. However, insufficient interfacial adhesion between the carbon fiber and the polymer matrix is the bane of CFRPs resulting in failure especially under bending loads [2–4]. The inert surface and low surface energy of the carbon fibers (CFs) does not encourage them to interact strongly with the polymer resin leading to poor adhesion between the fiber and the matrix [5–7].\nThe interphase is described as the region in between the bulk matrix and the fiber in which they are chemically and/or mechanically interconnected. It can be a nucleation zone, a diffusion zone, a chemical reaction zone or a blend of all of the mentioned zones [8,9]. Unlike an interface where there is a sharp change in properties, there is a gradual change in properties in the interphase. This leads to efficient transfer of stress between the matrix and the fiber. Therefore, it is essential to expand and improve the interphase to prevent easy delamination between the carbon fiber and the epoxy. To enhance the matrix/interphase properties of the CFRPs, the traditionally used approaches can be broadly categorized as: (i) addition of nano-fillers such as carbon black,\ncarbon nanotube, carbon nanofiber (CNF), graphene oxides, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) etc. to modify the matrix [10–14], (ii) surface treatment of the carbon fibers like liquid, gaseous or electro-chemical oxidation, plasma treatment etc. [15–18] and (iii) deposition/coating of the nano-fillers onto the fiber surface [19–23].\nUsually, polymer based sizing of a few nanometres is coated onto the carbon fiber during manufacturing to protect its surface from environmental damage and improve handleability [9]. The removal of the sized layer or desizing makes the surface of the carbon fiber eligible for surface treatment. Surface treatment through oxidation etches the surface of the fiber and introduces the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups which results in increase in interfacial interactions with the epoxy [24].\nThe interaction between fiber and epoxy was shown to be enhanced with the percentage of reactive functional groups on the carbon fiber resulting in higher flexural strength [25]. However, Jones et al. [18] have shown that the surface functional groups play a very small role to improve adhesion between the fiber and the matrix since they enable interaction of the matrix only with the surface of the fiber. Qian et al. [26] have reported that the surface treated CF composites show 50% improved interlaminar shear stress (ILSS) compared to untreated CF composites and the reported cause is the improved surface roughness of treated CFs which increases the mechanical interlocking in between the\n* Corresponding author.

An increment in interfacial shear stress (IFSS) in between the carbon fiber and the epoxy while a decrease in tensile strength of CF has been found by Kim et al. [5]. The decrease in tensile strength of CF is due to the electrochemical oxidation of CFs but this also leads to the increase in surface contact area, physical and chemical bonding between fiber and epoxy resulting in enhanced IFSS [5].\nIndividually, various researchers [2,11,27–34] have reported the effect of oxidation treatment of CF, coatings on CF and epoxy modification with different nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of composites. The flexural strength of the composite with nitric acid treated oxidized carbon fiber reinforcing polybenzoxazine has been reported to be 2.4 times the composite with untreated fibers [2]. Composites with plasma treated fibers have also proved weaker compared to composites with nitric acid treated oxidized fibers [2]. Wan et al. [27] also reported an increase in the flexural strength, modulus as well as shear strength and interlaminar shear strength of carbon fiber/polylactide composites with nitric acid treatment time of the carbon fibers. Nitric acid treatment increases the surface roughness in the form of crevices and creation of –COOH group i.e. increase in reactive sites which enhances the fiber-matrix adhesion [27].\nCoating of nano-fillers on the untreated fibers has also been shown to be beneficial for the flexural properties. Qin et al. [14] reported an increase of 82% in flexural strength of GNP coated CFs composite as compared to non-coated CFs composite. The carbon fiber was coated by immersing it into GNP solution. The non-coated CF composites fractographs showed the pure interfacial failure however the GNP coated CF composites fractographs showed cohesive failure [14]. GNP mixed epoxy carbon fiber composites showed improvement in in-plane shear modulus and strength and compressive strength [28]. H. Fukushima [30] also reported 20% and 15% increase in IFSS and flexural strength respectively for the exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets coated CF/Epoxy composites compared to control composites. The unidirectional CF/exfoliated graphene (EG) epoxy composites shows 28% increment in ILSS compared to baseline composite [31]. The liquid phase deposition technique was used to deposit EG on the fibers and resin transfer molding technique was used to manufacture the composite. The reason for the increment in ILSS was the formation of gradient interface which was confirmed by carbon element distribution and stiffness between carbon fiber and epoxy [31].\nIt is clear from the prior studies that appropriate treatment of the surface fiber in terms of removing the sized layer followed by introduction of reactive functional groups may be beneficial in improving the adhesion between the matrix and the fiber. Moreover, addition of nanofillers to the interface through various methods has also provided an improvement in flexural strength. However, the use of oxidative treatment of fibers coupled with graphene nanoplatelet coating has not been investigated for carbon-fiber reinforced epoxy composites. In the current study, we have made carbon-fiber epoxy composites using the vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) method. The effect of fiber oxidative treatment time as well as GNP coating on the fibers on the flexural response of the composites has been studied. We have shown that oxidative treatment of the fibers beyond an optimum time leads to deterioration in strength as well as elongation to failure even with GNP coating. However, carbon fiber oxidative treatment till an optimum time coupled with subsequent GNP coating gives the best combination of flexural strength and elongation to failure."

JEOL JSM-7600F Field Emission Gun-Scanning Electron Microscopes (FEG-SEM) was used to study the fractured surfaces and the elemental mapping of the laminates by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipped on SEM. EDS linear elemental mapping was recorded at least eight different sights for each condition of laminates. The cross-section of the composites was polished using sand paper and Cr2O3 suspension of less than 100 nm particle size followed by the cleaning with ethanol in ultrasonicator and drying. The SEM samples were coated with a few nanometres layer of platinum prior to examination.\nRaman spectra of carbon fibers with different treatments as well as GNPs were recorded using Raman Spectrometer (HORIBA HR 800) with 514.5 nm laser as incident light and 1-μm spot size. Each measurement was taken at 20x magnification for 120s. The spectra were acquired three times for each condition and the wavelength range was\n1000–2000 cm 1 for CF and 1000-3000 cm 1 for GNPs. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Bruker, Germany3000 Hyperion Microscope with Vertex 80 FTIR System) was used to investigate the functional groups of carbon fibers and GNPs using powder pressed KBr pellets. The wavenumber range of the FTIR spectra was 500–4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 0.2 cm 1.\nAccording to ASTM D790-02 standard, the flexural test was carried out taking three-point bending configuration by Instron model 3345 of 5 kN capacity. The test was performed at room temperature and the dimensions of the specimens were 50 mm (length) � 13.5 mm (width) � 1.8 mm (thickness). Span length was taken to be 30 mm to maintain the span to thickness ratio as 16:1. The samples were tested at a crosshead speed of 0.25 mm/min. At least four specimens per condition were tested for the flexural response.\nThe tensile test of fiber tows was performed at Instron E1000 of 1 kN capacity. To prepare the sample for the tensile testing, the tows for each condition were placed on the thin butter paper and glued with epoxyhardener at the both ends. The samples were kept at room temperature for 12 h to cure the epoxy. Minimum seven samples were tested for each condition and Weibull distribution function for the fracture strength was calculated [19]."

In Fig. 2, all EDS linear map plots are starting form carbon fiber to epoxy. One plot representative of the\nA.K. Srivastava et al.\nComposites Part B 179 (2019) 107539\naverage for each condition among all scans has been shown in Fig. 2. The gradual increase of carbon element proves an interphase formation between the epoxy and fiber. The average length of the interphase for each condition of laminates is plotted in Fig. S7. The average thickness of the interphase of Pristine, 0.4GNP, DOCF15/0GNP, DOCF15/0.2GNP and DOCF45/0.2GNP are 1.63, 1.92, 1.23, 2.62 and 1.18 μm respectively.\nThere is a significant thickness of interphase between the pristine fibers and the epoxy. This is because of the sizing layer that contains multiple functional groups (Fig. S5) that may bind with the epoxy and hence there is a gradation of carbon between the fiber and the epoxy. The interphase region increases in thickness with the addition of GNPs. This can be attributed due to their carbonaceous nature as well as presence of multiple functional groups (Fig. S2c) that can bind effectively with the matrix. DOCF15 shows a slight reduction in interphase thickness as it has only oxidative groups to bind with the epoxy vs. the sized fiber had multiple groups. Hence, the bonding enhancement is mainly through mechanical interlocking and not through extensive chemical bonding. There is an enhancement in interphase thickness with addition of 0.2 wt% GNP. The possibility of bonding between the GNPs and carbon fibers due to the oxygen functional groups (C–O, C–O–C, –OH) is confirmed by the FTIR spectra of the GNPs and carbon fibers. Addition of GNPs leads to better bonding between the oxidized fiber and the matrix leading to a larger interphase. There is a reduction in interphase thickness between the 45 min oxidized fiber coated with GNPs and the matrix. Significant thinning and groove formation in these fibers may be leading to GNPs accumulation in the grooves of the fibers instead of it helping forming a bond with the matrix. A schematic of the fiber, interphase and matrix for the different laminates is shown in Fig. 3. It represents the fiber and interphase thickness, grooves formation and the presence of the GNPs."

      "heading" : "3.2. Flexural properties",
      "text" : "Three-point bending or flexural loading applies both tensile and\ncompressive stresses on different part of the specimen and hence is a great way to determine the behavior of composites under these stresses. The four samples average data of the flexural test were collected according to ASTM D790-02 standard and are presented in Table 1. The data for flexural stress, flexural strain at maximum stress and flexural modulus is plotted in Fig. 4.\nIt can be seen that there is an improvement of around 20% in the flexural modulus with 0.4 wt% loading of GNPs. This can be ascribed to the interphase that is formed between the fiber and the matrix which is expected to be stiffer than the epoxy. This is owing to the stiffening effect of rigid GNPs. Lee et al. [35] reported the Young’s modulus and the intrinsic strength of graphene as 1 TPa and ̴ 30 GPa. It can be seen that the flexural modulus almost becomes half of that of pristine after desizing followed by oxidation of the fibers for 15 min. Thinning of carbon fibers may be resulting in lowering of volume fraction of fibers compared to the composites leading to a decrease in modulus. Moreover, there is a reduction in the thickness of the interphase layer compared to laminates made using pristine fibers (Figs. 2 and 3 and S7). However, laminates made by using DOCF15 fibers sprayed with 0.2 wt% GNP recover the stiffness loss due to the desizing and oxidative treatment. This is due to the stiffening effect of GNPs that compensates for the loss in thickness of the treated fibers. The interphase thickness with properties intermediate between the fiber and the matrix is also larger than the pristine condition (Figs. 2 and 3 and S7). Oxidation of fibers for 45 min diminishes the structural integrity and thickness of the fibers to a great extent (Figs. 2e and 3) along with a reduction in interphase thickness compared to DOCF15/0.2GNP. Thus, in spite of a coating of 0.2 wt% GNP, the flexural modulus of DOCF45/0.2 GNP is lower than the DOCF15/0.2GNP and pristine sample.\nThe flexural strength of 0.4GNP laminate shows an increase of 20% compared to the pristine laminate. A thicker interphase leads to efficient load transfer between the fiber and the matrix resulting in higher bending strength before failure (Fig. 3). DOCF15 laminates show a reduction in strength because of thinner reinforcing phase due to\nA.K. Srivastava et al.\nComposites Part B 179 (2019) 107539\ndesizing and acid treatment. Moreover, the interphase thickness is also smaller compared to the pristine laminate. However, addition of 0.2 wt % GNP enhances the strength because of efficient connection of fiber surface, GNPs as well as the matrix. This results in the thickest interphase layer resulting in effective stress transfer between the matrix and the fiber. However, DOCF45/0.2GNP leads to a severe reduction in strength due to the extreme weakening of the fibers. The lower thickness of fibers as can be seen in Fig. 2e reduces their load carrying ability.\nThe flexural strain at maximum stress shows a decrease of 6% in 0.4GNP laminate compared to pristine laminate. This may be due to blocking of interaction between the surface of fiber and matrix that could have prevented delamination (Fig. 3). The oxidation of carbon fiber in limited amounts has been shown to improve surface functionality [20,36]. It has been shown by multiple groups that desizing followed by acid treatment leads to an increase in surface roughness resulting in enhanced mechanical interlocking between the fiber and the\nmatrix [2,27]. Hence, there is an improvement in flexural strain for DOCF15 due to enhanced surface roughness (Fig. S3c) which helps in mechanical interlocking. Addition of GNPs prevents the mechanical interlocking to some extent that could have led to simultaneous straining of the matrix and fiber (Fig. 3). This results in reduction in flexural strain of DOCF15/0.2GNP specimens compared to DOCF15. DOCF45/0.2GNP shows even lower ductility inspite of higher surface roughness of the fiber. This is because of the weakening of the fiber resulting in fibers breaking at lower strains. 0.4GNP laminate has the highest flexural modulus and comparable strength as DOCF15/0.2GNP. However, DOCF15/0.2GNP has significant ductility in addition to the highest strength. This is owing to good mechanical interlocking of fiber and the matrix as well the thickest interphase. Thus, the sprayed GNP and the desizing-oxidation played a significant role in improving the interfacial interactions in fiber-matrix."

In case of 0.4GNP and DOCF15/0.2GNP (Fig. 5b, d), significant amount of epoxy is adhered on or near to the fiber periphery which indicates the good adhesion of the epoxy with the fiber surface.

However, ductility enhancement is obtained by desizing followed by oxidative treatment that leads to enhanced fiber roughness and functionalization. If GNP addition is coupled with desizing and functionalization, then a combination of both high strength and ductility can be obtained e.g. for DOCF15/0.2GNP laminates, there is a combined effect of oxidation of CF and GNP coating which leads to the stronger interfacial adhesion between the fiber and epoxy. The fracture surface morphology agrees with the flexural test results listed in Table 1."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "Flexural properties of carbon-fiber reinforced composites have been studied while changing the nature of the interface/interphase between the fiber and the epoxy. This has been achieved by varying the extent of desizing of the fiber as well as spraying of graphene nanoplatelets on the fiber surface. The flexural strength of the DOCF15/0.2GNP laminate was the highest among all the laminates. This became possible due to sufficient time for desizing without destroying the fibers. Moreover, the coating of GNPs leads the development of a continuous interphase between the fiber and the epoxy which has been confirmed by the SEMEDS mapping of carbon element. The largest interfacial region has been observed in DOCF15/0.2GNP laminate. The enhancement of the interface region is attributed to the bonding among CF, GNPs and epoxy due to the presence of oxygen functional groups. Moreover, effective mechanical interlocking due to high surface roughness of DOCF15/ 0.2GNP laminates leads to an improvement in flexural strain to failure compared to pristine laminates.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper."

In the current study, the desizing and oxidation treatment of carbon fibers and the coating of graphene nano-platelets (GNPs) on the carbon-fibers has been done with an aim to strengthen the interface/ interphase between the fiber and the matrix. GNPs were coated on the carbon fibers before making the final laminates through vacuum assisted resin transfer molding. The flexural strength of the laminates has been found to improve significantly with GNP addition. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy have been used to examine the nature of interface/interphase between the fiber and the matrix as well as the mechanism of failure of the composite.",
