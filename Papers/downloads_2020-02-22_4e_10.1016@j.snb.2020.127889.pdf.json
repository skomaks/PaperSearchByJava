      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Cell culture technology has been widely employed in various fields of scientific research, such as life sciences, pharmaceutical research, etc [1–4]. Cell culture is the most basic step in studies from small-scale research to high-throughput screening, and determines the success or failure of the research, during which pH monitoring is critical. Small changes in cell microenvironment and blood pH can cause disease [5]. When pH is greater than 7.6 or less than 6.0, cell damage or death occurs. Therefore, in order to ensure the optimal cell viability, the cell culture medium must be maintained within a physiological pH range [6]. Phenol red is the most common pH indicator in cell culture. However, its adverse effects on cell culture have been reported. Berthois et al. [7,8] demonstrated that phenol red promoted the proliferation of Michigan cancer foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells. WesierskaGadek et al. [9] observed that phenol red in the medium not only strongly promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of MCF-7 cells, but also affected their susceptibility to chemotherapy. Grady et al. [10] proved that cell culture at high pH and in the presence of phenol red is toxic to cells. And almost all MCF-7 cells were damaged after 4 h of culture in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) medium containing 10 g/mL phenol red at pH 8.0. Therefore, it is necessary to manufacture a sensor for real-time pH monitoring in a phenol red-free medium. So\nfar, many methods for monitoring pH have been developed. Due to the large size of the electrode itself, the electrode pH meter is not suitable to be used in small size environments and real-time monitoring of pH [11]. Fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors can be used to detect pH value in the microenvironment due to their small size and high sensitivity. Organic dyes, carbon dots and fluorescent proteins have been used to monitor local pH values [12–14]. And most of these pH sensors based on single fluorescence emission intensity are liable to photobleach or quench, and are vulnerable to light source instability [15–17]. To solve the above problems, some ratiometric fluorescent sensors have been developed. Ke et al. [18] used an amphiphilic lipid-DNA molecule as a cell-surfaceanchored ratiometric fluorescent probe for extracellular pH sensing. Ying et al. [19] developed a ratiometric i-motif sensor anchored on the cell surface for extracellular pH detection. Both methods provide high sensitivity and self-calibrate the interference caused by the environment on the basis of two different fluorescence emission intensities. However, these two sensors are costly due to the use of DNA sequences for modification. SERS spectroscopy, which has high sensitivity and is not affected by photobleaching, has been used for the detection of intracellular pH. But Raman probes attached to gold or silver surface are prone to lose or aggregate during SERS pH sensing [20,21]. Li et al. [22] used polyaniline-coated gold to form core-shell nanoparticles for\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.127889 Received 25 November 2019; Received in revised form 27 January 2020; Accepted 17 February 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

[23] developed bovine serum albumin (BSA) functionalized gold-4-mercaptopyridine nanoparticles (Au-(4-MPy)-BSA) to improve the stability of the gold substrates. However, the detection precision of the above methods is not perfect. In addition, the nanoparticles for fluorescence and SERS pH sensing are likely to enter cells, making it difficult to achieve real-time monitoring of extracellular pH [24–28]. So, it is necessary to develop a sensor that is stable in a biological environment and capable of sensing extracellular pH in real time.\nRecently, microfluidic droplet technology has been used to prepare microparticle-based sensors [29], which features high throughput, controllable preparation [30,31] and miniaturization, and has attracted attention in the fields of pH detection [32,33], glucose detection [34], sustained release drug and visual monitoring [35] and so on. By immobilizing the functional nanoparticles in the microgels, not only the self-aggregation and oxidation of the functional nanoparticles can be avoided [36], but also contamination or interference of the functional nanoparticles can be prevented. The microgels also capture and enrich the target molecules, producing an amplified signal [37]. Attractively, gel microparticles prepared by the microfluidic method are not only used for single mode detection but also for dual mode detection. Our group [32] used microparticles prepared on a microfluidic chip to encapsulate fluorescence and SERS probes for extracellular pH dual-mode monitoring. In that work, two sensing probes have to be placed in two hemispheres of microparticles through complex design. If only a kind of nanoparticle with dual-mode response is encapsulated in one microparticle, the preparation of the dual mode sensor will be much easier.\nPolyaniline (PANI) is a smart pH responsive polymer. Because the degree of proton doping of PANI depends on the concentration of H+, with the pH gradually increasing from acidic to basic, PANI transforms from a doped state to a dedoped state. In this process, not only does the SERS signal increase, but the color changes from green to blue, and finally to purple. Multicolor-SERS dual-mode pH monitoring can be achieved by encapsulating the dual-response pH sensor, PANI, in a single microparticle. It is well known that colorimetric analysis is more suitable for visual and rapid quantification in cell culture compared to electrode pH sensors and optical pH sensors, but with low sensitivity. Fortunately, polyaniline-coated gold nanorods (AuNRs@PANI) exhibit strong SERS signals. But the SERS detection is not as simple and convenient as colorimetry [38]. The combination of these two means can complement each other to achieve accurate, reliable and fast quantitative analysis.\nAiming at the real-time monitoring of pH value in the process of cell culture, we designed a two-mode multicolor-SERS pH sensing method based on smart nano-in-micro particles. The microparticles were fabricated by using a microfluidic chip with a simple T-channel [39]. Dual response pH probes, AuNR@PANI, were encapsulated in a polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) microgel to obtain AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA microparticles. According to the SERS intensity of quinone diimine of PANI, a SERS-based pH sensing method was constructed. And according to the different color states of PANI at different doping levels, a multicolor-based sensing method was constructed. We also studied the reversibility, stability, reproducibility and biocompatibility of AuNRs@ PANI/PEGDA microparticles systematically. The nano-in-micro particles were successfully applied to the continuous pH monitoring during MCF-7 cell culture."

After drying, a droplet of purified AuNRs@PANI was carefully put onto the TEM grids, and dried at room temperature. At last, the TEM grids were washed with water and dried at room temperature again [42].

      "text" : "The aniline was oxidatively polymerized on the surface of the AuNRs due to electrostatic attraction to obtain core-shell nano probes. Figure S1A shows the absorption spectra of AuNRs and AuNRs@PANI nanoparticles. The transverse/longitudinal plasmon wavelengths of AuNRs were 514/749 nm before coated with PANI. After coated with PANI, the lateral plasma peak of AuNRs underwent a small red shift of 4 nm. In contrast, the longitudinal plasma peak of AuNRs experienced a blue shift of 13 nm. These phenomena are consistent with those reported by Jiang et al. [43]. Figure S1B shows the successful preparation of the core-shell structure.\nFigure S2A is the SERS spectrum and corresponding picture of freshly prepared AuNRs@PANI nanoparticles, and Figure S2B is the SERS spectrum and corresponding picture of AuNRs@PANI nanoparticles stored at room temperature for half a year. There is no significant difference in SERS intensity and color of the nanoparticle solution, indicating that the PANI-coated AuNRs nanoparticles have good stability.\nWe prepared three AuNRs@PANI nanoparticle solutions by using 1.0 mM, 2.0 mM and 3.0 mM aniline respectively. Then the morphology of AuNRs@PANI nanoparticles in the three solutions was collected by a transmission electron microscope. As shown in Figure S3, the PANI shell thickness of the nanoparticles increases with the increase of the aniline concentration.\nNext, SERS spectra and pictures of the nanoparticles with different PANI shell thicknesses were collected. As shown in Figure S4, with the increase of shell thickness, the SERS intensity of the core-shell structure decreases. The solution of the nanoparticles prepared with 1.0 mM aniline is gray. The reason is that the PANI shell is thin, and the color of the AuNRs overlaps with the color of PANI. The nanoparticle solution prepared with 1.0 mM aniline has poor colorimetric effect. For the nanoparticles prepared with 2.0 mM and 3.0 mM aniline, the thickness of the polyaniline shell becomes thicker, and the solutions are green. Thus, their colorimetric effect is better. The core-shell nanoparticles prepared with 2.0 mM aniline have stronger SERS strength than those prepared with 3.0 mM aniline. Therefore, the core-shell nanoparticles prepared with 2.0 mM aniline were used for pH sensing in this work. In Fig. 1A, as a SERS substrate, AuNRs enhanced the Raman signal of PANI coated on the surface. As displayed in Fig. 1B, with pH increasing, the SERS intensity of AuNRs@PANI increases. Unfortunately, when the pH is less than 5.0, the SERS intensity of AuNRs@PANI changes irregularly because the nanoprobes are prone to agglomeration in an acidic environment [44,45]. And AuNRs@PANI aggregation is visible by naked eyes at pH 1.0 and 12.0. PANI exhibits five distinct states, including emeraldine base (EB), emeraldine salt (ES), pernigraniline base (PB), pernigraniline salt (PS) and leucoemeraldine base (LB) [46]. The pH response of PANI is achieved by proton doping and dedoping processes, and PANI switches between the ES and PB states [47]. The SERS spectroscopy of PANI is interpreted as follows. The characteristic peaks at 1622 cm−1 and 1190 cm−1 are associated with C–C stretching deformation and C–H bending in the deformation of benzenoid rings. The characteristic peaks at 872 cm−1 and 397 cm−1 are associated with out-of-plane deformation of benzenoid rings and in-plane deformation of benzenoid rings. The characteristic peaks at 1451 cm−1, 1421 cm−1, 1224 cm−1, 1170 cm−1 and 745 cm−1 are related to C=N stretching, C–C stretching, C–N stretching, C–H bending and imine deformation in the quinoid rings. As the environment changes from acidic to alkaline, the degree of doping decreases. Then the characteristic peaks of the quinone imine structure appear at 1451 cm−1, 1421 cm−1 1224 cm−1, 1170 cm−1, and 745 cm−1, and their strength gradually increases. And the intensity of characteristic peaks at 1622 cm−1, 1190 cm−1, 872 cm−1, and 397 cm−1 gradually decreases, indicating that the dedoping reaction destroys the benzene ring structure. As shown in Fig. 1C, the color of AuNRs@PANI transforms from green to bluish violet as the pH value increases, i.e. the state of PANI moves from ES to PB.\nThe state of AuNRs@PANI confirmed by SERS spectrum changes is consistent with that confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy. UV–vis spectra at different pH values are shown in Fig. 1D. As the pH of the AuNRs@\nScheme 1. Schematic diagram of preparing microparticles with the microfluidic chip.\nPANI rises from 2.0–11.0, the ES state of PANI shell switches to the PB state, and AuNRs@PANI exhibits absorption peaks around 340−350 nm, 420 nm, 517 nm and 770 nm at the ES state. They represent the ππ* electronic transition of the adjacent conjugated benzene rings, the polarization shoulder, the transverse plasmon absorption peak and the polarization region of the AuNRs, respectively [48,49]. When the pH value is higher than 10.0, the peak of PANI shell (ES) disappears around 420 nm, and the peak around 770 nm blueshifts to around 600 nm, which is the main characteristic peak of the imine nitrogens in the form of PB. The resulting spectrum is consistent with the results in the literature [50,51]. These results indicate that when the environmental pH of the AuNR@PANI nanoparticles changes from acidic to basic, the absorption peak and the SERS peak associated with the benzene ring decrease or even disappear. Conversely, the peak associated with the quinone ring appears, and the SERS intensity increases."

      "text" : "PEGDA is a biocompatible and photocurable hydrogel with good stability over a wide pH and a long time. As shown in Fig. 2, the AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA microparticles were incubated with BR buffers of different pH values for 30 min and 24 h, and then the images were collected. The diameters of the particles incubated for 30 min and 24 h are respectively 208±8 μm and 209±3 μm at pH 1.0, 210±10 μm and 207± 8 μm at pH 7.0, and 216±13 μm and 218±8 μm at pH 12.0 (n = 50). The nano-in-micro particles remained essentially constant in size as the pH increased, demonstrating their pH stability, and did not break under extremely acidic (pH 1.0) or very alkaline (pH 12.0) conditions. As shown in Figure S5, the nano-in-micro particles were further incubated with BR buffers in the range of pH 1.0–12.0 for 24 h to investigate the visualized sensing capability. In the former\nexperiment, the AuNR@PANI nanoparticles gradually changes from green to bluish violet as the pH increases (Fig. 1C), but the color change is not distinct. When AuNR@PANI probes were encapsulated in PEGDA, the color change is much more distinguishable under the stereomicroscope. The change of 0.5 pH unit can be visually recognized in the physiological range (pH 5.5–8.0), as shown in Fig. 3. The improvement in color distinguishability of the AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA can be explained from the following two aspects. On the one hand, the hydrogen bond between -NH/-NH2 on AuNRs@PANI surface and −COO- on the PEGDA chain changes the doping state of the protonic acid on the PANI backbone. After PANI was doped with protonic acid, charged ions transferred from the doped acid to the aniline chain. There is an interaction among the charged ions with nitrogen atoms and imine nitrogen atoms, forming polarons and bipolarons, which cause electron dissociation from the entire chain [52–55]. With the formation of hydrogen bonding between −COO- of PEGDA and -NH/-NH2 of PANI, the electron density transfer ability of aniline chain increases, that is, the electron quantity of phenyl-nitrogen increases, and the oxidation state of PANI has changed. On the other hand, AuNR@PANI nanoparticles with high density can be encapsulated in the microparticles. Thus, the dispersed AuNR@PANI nanoprobes were enriched in the PEGDA microparticles, which made the color change more visible. Figure S6 is the photo of nano-in-micro particles taken by a SONY camera in the BR buffers with pH 5.0-11.0. The gradual color change from green to purple can be easily recognized by naked eyes."

      "heading" : "3.3. SERS pH sensing based on AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA microparticles",
      "text" : "The SERS signal change is derived from the response of AuNRs@ PANI nanoparticles to different pH conditions. The SERS spectra of AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA in different pH media are shown in Fig. 4. The prominent peak around 1170 cm−1 is assigned to the respiratory\nvibration of quinondiimine. As the pH increases from 1.0–12.0, the SERS signal gradually increases, and the PANI shell gradually changes from the ES state to the PB state. The calibration curve for SERS pH sensing is based on peak intensities at 1170 cm−1 with a pH range of 1.0–12.0. Compared with the results previously reported [22,56], PEGDA significantly broadens the pH measurement range of Au/PANI from pH 2.0–8.0 to pH 1.0–12.0 thanks to the PEGDA hydrogels. On the one hand, AuNRs@PANI nanoparticles are fixed in PEGDA network,\nwhich prevents the nanoparticles from agglomerating at extreme pH values, and from escaping from the network and causing pollution or interference to the experimental system. On the other hand, PEGDA concentrates the AuNRs@PANI dispersed in aqueous solution into the microparticles, which enriches SERS signals. As shown in Fig. 5, the characteristic peak at 1170 cm−1 can be applied for quantitative analysis of physiological pH with a resolution of 0.2 pH unit. The fitting curve is y=-5707.46 + 1164.96x. (R2 = 0.995). Lindfors et al. used PANI to measure the pH in the range of 7.0–10.5 with a precision of 0.1 or 0.2 pH unit [57,58]. The method has high precision but does not realize the detection of the physiological pH below pH 7.0. Li et al. also used PANI to measure the pH in a physiological range of 4.6–8.0 with a precision of 0.4 pH unit [22]. However, it is not as accurate as other methods. Our method is capable of accurately monitoring pH change of 0.2 pH unit over a physiological pH range of 5.4–8.0, and meets the need of pH monitoring for cell microenvironment and blood. Table 1 shows the comparison of the materials, the quantitative range and precision of the probes in the fluorescence and SERS methods for cell pH measurement. Nano-scale sensors are likely to enter cells and difficult to achieve extracellular pH sensing. Sensors modified with DNA sequences are expensive and complicated to operate. Compared with the above sensors, the sensor proposed in this work solves the problem that the nanoparticles may be endocytosed, and the detection of extracellular pH is achieved. In addition, the proposed sensor is simple and has high quantification precision.\nSince the protonation and deprotonation of PANI are reversible with pH change [60,61], it is expected that the AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA\nmicroparticles are reusable. The expectation was confirmed by measuring the SERS intensity at 1170 cm−1 of the nano-in-micro particles for 5 cycles at pH 2.0 and 11.0, as shown in Figure S7. The result shows that the nano-in-micro particles have good potential for reusability in pH monitoring. After incubated in a pH 2.0 BR buffer for 24 h, the nano-in-micro particles were quickly taken out and put into a pH 11.0 BR buffer, and the pH response curve was monitored by SERS. As shown in Figure S8, the nano-in-micro particles responded immediately to the changed pH, and the response signal reached a platform after 10 min. The rapid response of the nano-in-micro particles reveals their potential for continuous pH monitoring. The reproducibility of the SERS assay based on AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA microparticles was investigated. As shown in Figure S9, SERS spectra were acquired with the particles in buffers of pH 2.0, pH 7.0 and pH 11.0, and the RSDs of the Raman peak intensity at 1170 cm−1 were 5.9 %, 2.6 % and 4.8 % (n = 15), respectively. We also investigated whether the nanoparticles in the microparticles leaked. After 12 h and 60 h co-incubation of the nano-inmicro particles with BR buffer of pH 7.0, 15 points were randomly selected each time to monitor the SERS signals. As shown in Figure S10, the signals of the microparticles incubated for 12 h and 60 h are almost identical, which indicates no leakage of the nanoparticles. In addition, the biocompatibility of the microparticles was studied using the classical MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 6, the cell survival rate is over 90 % after 48 h co-culture with the nano-in-micro particles, which is attributed to the non-toxic components of the PEGDA. In summary, SERS nano-in-micro particles have the following advantages in pH sensing. First, it is stable and usable in strongly acidic media, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional SERS pH sensors, which often fail in media with a pH below 5.5 [44]. Second, the precision can reach a 0.2 pH unit, which is more precise than other spectral measurements based on PANI [53,62,63]. Third, the microparticles exhibit favourable reversibility, excellent reproducibility, good biocompatibility, and fast response."

We compared the SERS signals and color change of the particles in pH 7.4, 2.0, and 11.0 buffers. The color and the SERS signal of the particles changed with the pH changing, indicating that the changes in Raman signal intensity and color is mainly affected by pH.\nTable 1 Comparison of the material, the quantitative range and precision of the probe in fluorescence and SERS methods for cell pH measurement.\nNo. Method applied pH range precision(△pH) Sensing position Materials used Reference\n1 Fluorescence 5.8-8.0 0.2 Extracellular Lipid-DNA probe [18] 2 Fluorescence 5.0-7.0 0.2 Extracellular Ratiometric i-motif sensor [19] 3 Fluorescence 5.2-8.8 0.4 Intracellular Label-free carbon dots [59] 4 Fluorescence 4.4-5.4 0.2 Intracellular Spiropyran derivative [26] 5 SERS 4.6-7.4 0.4 Intracellular Polyaniline@gold nanoparticles [22] 6 SERS 4.0-9.0 0.5 Intracellular Au-(4-MPy)-BSA [23] 7 SERS 5.4-8.0 0.2 Extracellular AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA This work\nFig. 6.

      "text" : "We further used the AuNRs@PANI/PEGDA microparticles to monitor the pH change of the culture medium of MCF-7 tumor cells. Normally, the tumor microenvironment is markedly acidic, and the pH ranging from 5.5–7.4 may appear in the tumor microenvironment [64–66]. Acidic extracellular pH may lead to more severe invasion of tumor cells, cell genetic mutations, increased drug resistance, tumor migration, proliferation and metastasis [6]. We monitored the extracellular pH change using the multicolor-SERS dual-mode strategy. The pH of the fresh cell culture medium measured by SERS is 7.50± 0.05, which is close to the pH value of 7.40 measured by a pH meter. Fig. 7 shows the change in pH of the medium over time monitored by using the microparticles-based colorimetric method. With the prolongation of MCF-7 cell culture time, the pH value of the culture medium was significantly reduced. In the cell-free fresh medium, the AuNRs@PANI/ PEGDA microparticles remained alkaline, and the color of the particles was blue. After co-cultured with the cells for 48 h, the nano-in-micro particles turned green, indicating that the pH of the cell microenvironment is below 6.0. After that, the pH was further accurately quantified by SERS. As shown in Table S1, after cultured for 48 h, the pH of the cell microenvironment decreased from 7.38±0.04–5.89± 0.01. The results measured by the SERS method are consistent with those measured by a pH meter (FiveGo F2). So the pH change trend can be easily and quickly distinguished by using the nano-in-micro particle-based colorimetric method, and accurate quantitative detection of extracellular pH can be realized by using the nanoin-micro particle-based SERS method. We combined the two sensing strategies into one microparticle, and the resultant multicolor-SERS dual-mode pH-sensing method will be convenient and valuable for physiological pH monitoring, such as in 3D microfluidic cell culture."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "We proposed a multicolor-SERS dual-mode method for pH sensing. The PEGDA particles successfully encapsulated smart AuNRs@PANI nanoparticles with no significant leakage. Conventional pH-sensitive SERS probes typically fail under extreme pH values and high salt\nconditions. Herein, the AuNRs@PANI is stable in the microparticles, and the SERS detection based on the nano-in-micro particles has a wide response range from pH 1.0 to pH 12.0. The SERS sensitivity is also enhanced by concentrating AuNRs@PANI into PEGDA. The SERS pH sensor has a precision of 0.2 pH unit. At the same time, AuNRs@PANI/ PEGDA also exhibited vivid color change within the physiological pH range, and was used to visualize pH change with a precision of 0.5 pH unit. In conclusion, the nano-in-micro particles offer the following advantages in pH sensing. First, the proposed dual-mode pH detection method has a wide pH detection range. Second, it combines the simple and fast recognition of colorimetric method and the accurate quantification of SERS. Third, the microgels prevent the contamination of the cell culture system from the nanoparticles. This method was successfully applied to monitor pH change in tumor cell microenvironments, and will be ideal for monitoring pH in microsamples or microsystems.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."

    "abstractText" : "A multicolor and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) dual-mode pH sensing method based on microparticles was proposed, which combined the advantages of high sensitivity of SERS and convenience of colorimetric visualization. Polyethylene glycol diacrylate microgels were fabricated using a T-channel microfluidic chip, and the polyaniline-coated gold nanorods were encapsulated in the microgels. Based on the nano-in-micro particles, pH monitoring within the range of 1.0–12.0 was achieved through multicolor and SERS dual-mode sensing. The protonation and deprotonation of polyaniline led to changes in Raman signal intensity and color of microparticles. The pH changes during cell culture were successfully monitored by SERS quantification and microscopic images of the microparticles. And the microparticles exhibit excellent stability, reversibility, biocompatibility, anti-interference ability and signal enhancement ability. The pH sensing method has a wide pH detection range and is especially suitable for pH monitoring in microsystems and micro-environments.",
