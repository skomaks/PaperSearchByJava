Boron nano fertilization Boric acid Calcareous soils Plant pigments\nA B S T R A C T\nBoron is among the necessary nutrients for plant growth and yield production, and it can improve the nutritional properties of forage crops. However, at higher levels it maybe toxic adversely affecting plant growth and forage quality. Plant boron concentration is affected by different parameters including boron fertilization, soil, climate, plant species, etc. A new era in the field of plant fertilization is the use of nano technology. Accordingly, a factorial field experiment on the basis of a complete block design in six replicates was conducted in a 300- hactare agro-industry area. The objectives were to investigate the effects of different boron treatments on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.): 1) boron concentration, and 2) pigment contents including chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids. Six regions with different properties were selected for the experiment; the soil samples were collected using GPS. The experimental treatments including: 1) soil type (S1-S6), 2) boron sources including boric acid (B1) and nano boron fertilization (B2), and 3) number of spraying (zero-, one-, two-, and three-time) were tested. The nano structure of boric acid-copper in an aqueous medium was produced using the chemical reduction method. The results indicated that soil type, boron source and number of spraying significantly affected (P≤ 0.01) alfalfa boron concentration and pigment content. The mean of alfalfa boron concentration by B1 and B2 was 103.52 and 111.52% higher than control. The three-time spraying significantly increased B concentration related to the other spraying treatments (P≤ 0.05) as it resulted in a 207.81% increase compared with the control treatment. The three-time spraying resulted in the highest increase of pigment contents (P≤ 0.05) including chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids compared with the other treatments. Although the highest boron and pigment contents were resulted by the three-time spraying, the combined use of B2 and the two-time spraying was the most optimum treatment (non-toxic) significantly increasing alfalfa boron and pigment contents (P≤ 0.05). It would be possible to produce alfalfa at large amounts and with suitable forage quality using boron nano fertilization (synthesized and tested in this research work) under calcareous conditions."

      "text" : "Boron (B) is among the essential micronutrients for plant growth and yield production [1]. The most important sources of B for plant use are soil colloids including organic and mineral ones [2,3]. The critical range of B deficiency and B toxicity is little [4]. Accordingly, managing this nutrient and investigating its critical level in the soil and plant is not easy, and is of significance [5]. The critical level of B in the soil and plant has been investigated by different research work and the suitable range of 30–80mg kg−1 soil has been suggested for alfalfa [6].\nBoron is mobile in some plants and immobile in some other plants [7]. It is because the mobility of B from the cellular outer space to the internal space is controlled by the formation of polypol complex, which\nis not available at required amount in some plants. Accordingly, providing B at sufficient levels in plants lacking polypol for improving pollination [8,9], fruit quality and storage [10] and plant tolerance under stress is a challenge [11]. It is hence essential to use a more efficient method of B fertilization resulting in higher B uptake and utilization by plant.\nA new era in the field of plant fertilization and environmental remediation is the use of nano technology [12], which is really efficient and of economical significance compared with the ordinary methods. Research work has indicated that the use of nutrients at the nano scale (nano fertilization) can increase nutrient efficiency and results in the less use of fertilizer, increased yield production and decreased pollution of the environment [13–18].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2019.02.014 Received 29 September 2018; Received in revised form 12 December 2018; Accepted 27 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\nThe effects of nano-fertilization with different elements have been investigated by researchers. Some research work has indicated the toxic, and some indicted the positives effects of nano-particles on plant growth. For example, Sharma and Uttam [19] analysed different morphological and biochemical properties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings subjected to copper (Cu) nano-fertilization using laser induced fluorescence and spectroscopy. The authors found the toxic effects of Cu on wheat seedlings by the increased level of lipid peroxidation. In another similar study, Sharma et al. [20] indicated the positive effects of gold nano-particles on the growth of wheat seedlings. The results indicated the enhancement of proteins, lipids, cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, and lignin in the leaves of wheat seedlings affecting the rigidity and functionality of cellular wall. Bharti et al. [21] found both the negative and positive effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the growth of garlic (Allium sativum) seedlings. According to the results such nano-particles decreased plant root length, and increased plant aerial growth, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, carotenoid, and quercetin in the leaves. Sharma and Uttam [22] investigated the toxic effects of Al2O3 nano-particles on the growth and physiology of wheat seedlings and indicated the mechanisms by which the seedlings can resist the stress. The Al2O3 nano-particles resulted in the increased production of proteins, lipids, hemicelluloses, cellulose, pectin and lignin in wheat seedlings as the mechanisms, which may enhance plant resistance under AL2O3 stress.\nThe passage of nano particle into the cellular membrane is a function of cellular diameter, and the smaller nano particles can easily cross the membrane [23,24]. The movement of nano particle into the plant cell is controlled by the carrier proteins, membrane complexes, and root exudates [25,26]. The uptake of nano particles by plant cuticle and stomata and their subsequent transport to the other cells by plasmodesmata has also been shown by research work [27–29].\nThe nano particle in the cytoplasm moves to the cytoplasmic organelles and it is subsequently utilized in the cellular metabolism [24]. The coated boric acid on the metal nano particle (size of 10–1000 nano meter) compared with the fertilizer at the macro scale, can easily cross the cuticle and move all over the plant plasma membrane. This action is done in the absence of polysaccharide complexes indicating that the metal nano particle catalyzes the crossing of compounds into the cellular plasma membrane [7].\nAlfalfa is among the important forage crops and its growth and yield production is significantly affected by B. The favorable effects of B on crop growth and yield production has been indicated by different research work, however to our knowledge there is not any data on the use of B nano fertilization affecting alfalfa physiology under calcareous conditions. Accordingly, the objective of the research work was to investigate the effects of B resources (boric acid and nano fertilization) and number of spraying on alfalfa B concentration and pigment content in different calcareous soils."

Accordingly, 0.496 g CuCO4 was added to one liter of water (distilled twice), heated to the temperature of 80 °C, and was mixed for one minute. Boric acid at 0.12 g was poured into the solution and mixed for two minutes. Sodium borohydride at 1.26 g was dropped into the solution, which was heated until the color changed. The solution was allowed to cool down to the room temperature and was mixed for 50min. To avoid any changes in the nano structure, the production and consumption (spraying) of nano boric acid was done simultaneously [7,30]. The concentration of B in the nano fertilizer was used as the reference for the production of B from boric acid. To make the experimental treatments comparable and avoid any error in the production of nano fertilizer, Cu (at the amount\nused for the production of nano fertilizer) was also mixed with the boric acid solution."

The Zeta analysis of the particle distribution indicated that although the particles with the diameter of 5–10 nm were present, the dominant size of the particles were in the range of 10–1000 nm, and the highest accumulation was related to the range of 100 nm (Fig. 2). Table 1 presents the physical and chemical properties of the selected soils with a wide range of properties. For example, the soil B is in the range of 0.79–1.67mg kg−1, clay: 18–34%, and organic matter: 1.38–3.10 %.\nAnalysis of variance indicated that the effects of soil type, B source, number of spraying, and their interactions significantly (P≤ 0.01) affected alfalfa B concentration (Table 2). The mean differences also indicated that soil type significantly affected the alfalfa concentration as the highest and the least B concentrations were resulted by S3 and S6, respectively. Accordingly, the B concentration in S3 was 1.6 times higher than that of S6. Similarly, the B sources also significantly affected alfalfa B concentration and the highest and the least values were resulted by B2 and B3, respectively. The alfalfa B concentration\nincreased by 111.52 and 103.52% in B2 and B1, compared with control. However, the significant difference in plant B concentration resulted by B2 and B1 was only 3.93% (Fig. 3A).\nThe interaction effects of soil and B source indicated that the highest B concentration was resulted by the combination of S3 and B2 and the least concentration by S1 and control treatment.

The corresponding values for B1 were equal to 346.26, 46.89, 74.44, 136.54, 42 and 42.7% (Fig. 3A).\nThe three-time spraying significantly increased B concentration related to the other spraying treatments (P≤ 0.05) as a 207.81% increase was resulted by the three-time spraying compared with the control treatment. However, the difference in B concentration between the onetime spraying and the two-time spraying was only 9.38% significantly different from the three-time spraying. The interaction effects of soil and number of spraying indicated that the combination of S1 and the three-time spraying resulted in the highest (638.27% increase related to the control, P≤ 0.05) and S1 and control resulted in the least B concentration (Fig. 3B). The highest and the least B concentration were resulted by the combination of the three-time spraying and B2, and by the zero-time spraying and B1, respectively.

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "Boron (B), as an important micronutrient, determines plant growth and yield production by affecting different physiological processes including the pigment contents. Plant chlorophyll content is a major parameter influencing the important process of photosynthesis. Accordingly, providing plants with the adequate amount of B is a must for the optimum production of crop plants under different conditions including calcareous soils. The ordinary methods of B fertilization are not efficient, environmentally and economically, and may not supply adequate amounts of B for plant use.\nThe important physiology and functioning of boron in plant include: 1) the mobility of boron in plant is affected by polyol transport molecules, 2) the polysaccharides complex of cell wall (pectin polymers) determines the boron crosstaking, 3) boron affects membrane processes, 4) membrane functioning is rapidly altered by boron, 4) the metabolic pathways are influenced by boron in plant by affecting the apoplastic proteins and the manganese related enzymes, 5) boron alleviates the toxic effects of aluminum on root growth of dicotyledonous plants, 6) boron regulates pollen germination, 7) boron enhances fruit yield and quality, 8) plant stress genes are induced by boron deficiency and toxicity [1,11].\nArif et al. [41] found that the combined use of B and Zn significantly increased rice growth and yield as well as chlorophyll content and B absorption and assimilation. The deficiency of B can directly and indirectly affect the photosynthesis process [42]. The rate of photosynthesis in different soybean genotypes increased by using boron and molybdenum compared with control [43].\nThe results of this research work indicated that soil type can\nsignificantly affect alfalfa B concentration and pigment contents. The differences in soil B concentration are the result of pH, soluble B concentration, soil texture and moisture, soil minerals, the type and amount of organic matter, the type of exchangeable ions, plant species, etc. (Table 1). The surface adsorption of B increases with increasing pH from 3 to 9. Aluminum and iron hydroxide, calcium carbonate, organic matter and clay minerals are the main sources of B adsorption [44–48].\nThe efficient uptake of B by plant is an important factor determining B utilization by plant. Although boric acid can provide plant with its required amounts of B, it can adversely affect N fixation process in legumes including alfalfa, as it may not be as efficient as B nano fertilization. The research work by Deb [7] indicated that the boric acid on the metal nano particles (10–1000 nm), is able to easily move across the cellular membrane in the absence of the polysaccharide complexes, and as a result the metal nano particles act as a catalyst for the movement of nutrients across the cellular membrane. According to Liu et al. [49] the coating and cementing of nano and nano composite are able to regulate the diffusion of nutrients from the fertilizer particles. Different research work has indicated that the use of nano particles for providing plants with their adequate amounts of nutrients is an efficient method environmentally and economically [15].\nThe number of spraying also significantly affected alfalfa B concentration and pigment contents. The three-time spraying resulted in the highest alfalfa B concentrations (110mg kg−1), much higher than plant requirement, which in some cases were at toxic levels, indicating that the three-time spraying is not a suitable number of spraying. However, this was not the case for the two-time spraying as it resulted in the most optimum and efficient level of B for alfalfa use. The reason that there was not a significant difference between the one-time spraying and the two-time spraying on B concentration can be due to the significant plant growth till the two-time spraying and the subsequent dilution effect. However, during the three-time spraying the plant did not have a significant growth and hence the concentration of B significantly increased.\nThe sufficient level of B in alfalfa is equal to 30–80mg kg−1, indicating that the plants in the control treatment (35.42 mg kg−1) were B deficient. The increases of 50.66 and 50% in B concentrations by B2 and B1, using the one-time spraying revealed that there was not any significant difference between the two treatments. This can be due to the fact that during the initial stages of plant growth (little plant biomass) plant is not demanding to B. However, the B2 (62.5mg kg−1) treatment significantly increased B concentration in plant over the B1 treatment (54mg kg−1) (P≤ 0.05).\nIt should also be mentioned that there was not a significant difference between B concentration at the one-time and the two-time spraying. Research work has shown the higher efficiency of nano fertilizer at less amount, compared with chemical fertilizer [50–52]. The formulation of nano-structure can behave more precisely, and gradually release the nutrients for plant use in response to environmental conditions and biological demands [51]. According to the results, different soil types were B deficient under control treatment, and the two-time spraying treatment increased the alfalfa B concentration to a favorable level by B2 (62.54mg kg−1) and B1 (54mg kg−1). Will et al. [53] found that depending on B concentration in plant the absorption and mobility of B in plant is affected."

    "abstractText" : "Boron is among the necessary nutrients for plant growth and yield production, and it can improve the nutritional properties of forage crops. However, at higher levels it maybe toxic adversely affecting plant growth and forage quality. Plant boron concentration is affected by different parameters including boron fertilization, soil, climate, plant species, etc. A new era in the field of plant fertilization is the use of nano technology. Accordingly, a factorial field experiment on the basis of a complete block design in six replicates was conducted in a 300hactare agro-industry area. The objectives were to investigate the effects of different boron treatments on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.): 1) boron concentration, and 2) pigment contents including chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids. Six regions with different properties were selected for the experiment; the soil samples were collected using GPS. The experimental treatments including: 1) soil type (S1-S6), 2) boron sources including boric acid (B1) and nano boron fertilization (B2), and 3) number of spraying (zero-, one-, two-, and three-time) were tested. The nano structure of boric acid-copper in an aqueous medium was produced using the chemical reduction method. The results indicated that soil type, boron source and number of spraying significantly affected (P≤ 0.01) alfalfa boron concentration and pigment content. The mean of alfalfa boron concentration by B1 and B2 was 103.52 and 111.52% higher than control. The three-time spraying significantly increased B concentration related to the other spraying treatments (P≤ 0.05) as it resulted in a 207.81% increase compared with the control treatment. The three-time spraying resulted in the highest increase of pigment contents (P≤ 0.05) including chlorophyll a, b, total, and carotenoids compared with the other treatments. Although the highest boron and pigment contents were resulted by the three-time spraying, the combined use of B2 and the two-time spraying was the most optimum treatment (non-toxic) significantly increasing alfalfa boron and pigment contents (P≤ 0.05). It would be possible to produce alfalfa at large amounts and with suitable forage quality using boron nano fertilization (synthesized and tested in this research work) under calcareous conditions.",
