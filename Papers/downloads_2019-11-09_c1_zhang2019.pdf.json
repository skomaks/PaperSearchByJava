      "text" : "With the rapid development of the world economy, the growing contradiction between energy and environment is becoming a great challenge facing all mankind. It is vital to search for alternative sources of energy to substitute the fossil fuel or reduce its dependency. Molecular hydrogen can be considered as one of the best energy carriers, due to the high energy density and calorific value as well as the environment-friendly combustion products [1–3]. The electrochemical water splitting is deemed to be a very promising technology to generate the fuel hydrogen, in view of the earth-abundant reactant water, high hydrogen production efficiency and no emission of greenhouse gases or other polluting gases. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H+ + 2e−=H2), as the cathodic half reaction of water splitting, is a sluggish kinetic process, thus the core challenge is to develop the highly efficient catalyst to effectively minimize the necessary overpotential [4,5].\nAt present, the noble-metal Pt is the most efficient electrocatalyst for HER, but the high cost and scarcity limit the widespread industrial applications [6,7]. Therefore, researchers have made tremendous\nefforts to search for the low-cost and inexpensive HER catalysts to replace the Pt-based materials [8–33]. Recent studies have revealed that some materials can exhibit the promising applications as the HER electrocatalysts, such as, transition metal phosphides [17–21], sulfides [22–24], borides [7,25], carbides [26–29], nitrides [30,31] and carbon materials [32,33] etc.\nAmong them, the HER catalysts based on the two-dimensional (2D) materials have been attracting the researchers' great attention, since the unique atomic-thickness plane can bring some distinct advantages in favor of HER activity, such as, endowing them with more exposed active sites, allowing them as the idea platform to easily couple with other materials or substrate, and making them facilely activated and optimized for higher HER activity by applying strain or introducing defects and heteroatoms [34].\nCurrently, both the theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed that some 2D nanostructures can exhibit the high HER catalytic activity [35–46]. For example, 2D MXenes (e.g. Ti2C, V2C and Ti3C2) have been demonstrated to exhibit the good HER activity, where their surfaces usually are terminated by the O atoms and these O atoms can serve as the catalytic active sites for HER [39]. 2D transition metal\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.03.106 Received 25 November 2018; Received in revised form 5 March 2019; Accepted 12 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

All rights reserved.\nT\nborides (e.g. Fe2B2) [40] can be also predicted to be the promising HER electrocatalyst, in view of the good conductivity and sufficient active sites. Besides, 2D graphene, which is inert for HER, can be effectively activated by doping various dopants (e.g. N, B, O, S and P) [41]. Additionally, the formed 2D composite systems by coupling graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with graphene can also present the high HER activity [42,43]. Moreover, the 2D layered transition metal disulfides (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2 and WS2) can also exhibit the good HER activity, where the structural edges can act as the most active sites for HER [23,44–46].\nDifferent from the above nanomaterials, 2D layered GeP3 nanomaterials can possess the unique structural feature with the puckered honeycomb configuration, which can be viewed as the product via doping Ge into the famous phosphorene. Recent investigations reveal that series of easily exfoliable 2D materials XP3 (X=Ge [47], Sn [48], In [49] and Ca [50]) can exhibit the high mobility. In this work, we intend to explore the HER catalytic activity on the monolayer and fewlayered GeP3 nanomaterials. On the layered GeP3 nanostructures, each P atom bonds to neighboring two P atoms and one Ge atom, leaving one lone pair, which will be very promising to bring the HER activity at the P-site. On the other hand, each Ge atom forms three GeeP bonds with three neighboring P atoms, leaving single electron on Ge atom, and the electron is partially transferred to P atoms, all of which could bring the appropriate adsorption state of H* at the Ge-site. Therefore, it is highly anticipated that these 2D layered GeP3 nanomaterials can possess the high HER activity. It is worth mentioning that the monolayer and fewlayered GeP3 nanostructures are predicted to be stable and be easily achieved by exfoliating the bulk counterpart synthesized in experiment [47]. Additionally, the experemental results show that GeP3 can serve as a promising electrode material with the superior cyclic stability for sodium ion batteries, and even GeP3 can exhibit better mechanical endurance and electrochemical performance than the similar layered GeP5 [51]. And GeP5 can be experimentally demonstrated to keep stable in both common organic solvents and proton solvents (e.g. water and alcohol) [52]. Thus, it can be reasonably anticipated that GeP3 can also possess good stability in water environment.\nFurthermore, considering that the typical puckered structure can be advantageous to make these 2D layered GeP3 systems bear a large surface strain, we would like to propose the effective strategy through imposing the surface strain to further enhance the HER activity by simultaneously optimizing the adsorption state of H* and electronic structure of system. It is noteworthy that surface strain can be applied to improve the catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [53]. Moreover, we will construct a new kind of 2D composite nanomaterials by coupling the monolayer GeP3 with graphene, and explore the HER catalytic activity. Note that some layered GePx/C composite structures have been experimentally synthesized, all of which can exhibit the good stability and may be employed to realize the high-performance lithium/sodium ion batteries [54–56]. Overall, this study will be able to provide the valuable theoretical insights to promote the excellent 2D GeP3 nanomaterials in the application of the low-cost and high-performance HER electrocatalysts."

      "text" : "In this work, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional [57] is used to perform all the calculations in the framework of Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [58,59] based on the density functional theory (DFT), where a semi-empirical van der Waals (vdW) proposed by Grimme (DFT-D2) is included to account for the dispersion interactions [60,61]. It is worth mentioning that DFT-D2 method has been widely used in predicting the HER catalytic activity for various systems [7,26,62–69], and the predicted HER activities by DFT-D2 can be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results [7,26,62–66]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) approach is\nemployed to describe the electron–ion interactions [70,71], and the kinetic energy cutoff is set as 500 eV for the plane wave expansion. The Monkhorst-Pack k-points of 5× 5×3, 5×5×1 and 5×5×1 are adopted to relax the geometrical structures of bulk GeP3, the slab model corresponding to (003) surface of bulk structure, and the monolayer or few-layered models of GeP3, respectively. Note that the (003) surface can be modeled by using six-layered slab model, where the two upper GeP3-layers are fully relaxed, while the remaining four layers are frozen. The 147 and 63 k-points are used to compute the density of state (DOS) for the bulk and two-dimensional systems, respectively. Vacuum regions of 20 Å along the non-periodic directions is set to avoid the interactions between neighboring periodic images for the two-dimensional models. For all the computations, the convergence thresholds are set as 10−4 eV in energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 in force. Note that we have performed a computational test to explore the effect of supercell size on the computed free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*), by making a comparison between 1× 1 and 2× 2. The computed results reveal that all the obtained ΔGH* values for TGe and TP sites based on 2×2 supercell model can be very close to the corresponding those from 1×1 supercell size, reflecting the reliability of the computed ΔGH* results based on 1× 1 supercell size (more details have been provided in the Section I of Supplementary information). Therefore, to make the computational cost less demanding, in this study we compute all the ΔGH* values of studied systems by using 1×1 supercell size.\nMoreover, the hydrogen adsorption energy involved in this work can be computed by the following equation:\n∆ = + − −∗E E E E(system H) (system) 1 2 (H )H 2 (1)\nwhere E(system+H) and E(system) are the total energies of the studied systems with and without a H atom, respectively, and E(H2) is the total energy of a hydrogen molecule in the gas phase.\nFurthermore, the Gibbs free energy for the studied systems is calculated by the following formula:\n∆ = ∆ + ∆ − ∆∗ ∗G E E STH H ZPE (2)\nwhere ΔEH∗, ΔEZPE, and ΔS are the hydrogen adsorption energy, zero point energy change and entropy change of H* adsorption, respectively. The ΔEZPE and TΔS are obtained by following the scheme proposed by Nørskovet et al. [72]. Specifically, ΔEZPE for H* can be obtained by the equation ∆ = −∗E E EZPE ZPE(H ) 1 2 ZPE(H )2 . Our computed EZPE(H2) value is about 0.287 eV, which is close to the value reported by Nørskovet et al. [72]. In addition, the ΔS value is calculated by using the equation ∆ = − ≈ −∗S S S S(H ) (H ) (H )12 2 1 2 2 , due to the negligible vibrational entropy of H*. The corresponding TΔS can be determined to be −0.205 eV, since TS(H2) is 0.41 eV for H2 at 298 K and 1 atm.\nMoreover, the following formula is defined to compute the interaction energy between two neighboring layers in the layered system:\n= −E E nE n( )/int t s (3)\nwhere Etand Es are the total energies of the few-layered system and the corresponding sole layer, respectively, and nmeans the layer number of composite system. Following this definition, the negative Eint value indicates the exothermic (energetically favorable) process."

      "text" : "As illuminated in Fig. 1a–b, bulk GeP3 is a honeycomb structure in ABC layered stacking, and its lattice belongs to space group mR3 , where each Ge atom has three GeeP bonds with three adjacent P atoms, and each P atom gets one GeeP bond and two PeP bonds with the neighboring Ge and P atoms in one layer, respectively. By the DFT computations, the obtained lattice parameters are a= b=7.106 Å and c=9.526 for bulk GeP3, in which the optimized GeeP and PeP bond lengths are 2.481 and 2.234 Å, respectively. All of these computed values are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental\nvalues [73]. The computed DOS result shows that the bulk GeP3 can exhibit the metallic behavior, which can be dominated by the correlative states from Ge and P atoms crossing the Fermi level (Fig. 1c). Note that good electrical conductivity can be beneficial for the HER activity of material.\nThe recent study has revealed that the monolayer or few-layered GeP3 can be easily exfoliated from the corresponding bulk structure, due to the typical layered stacking [47]. In this work, we will mainly focus on the HER catalytic activity for these layered GeP3 systems. For the convenience, the structures of monolayer and few-layered GeP3 are marked by nL-GeP3."

      "heading" : "3.1. The evaluation on the HER catalytic activity for the monolayer and few-layered GeP3 systems",
      "text" : "In view of the fact that the HER activity over a given system can be closely correlated to the adsorption energy of a single H atom on the system, the free energy of H* (ΔGH*) can be used as an effective descriptor to evaluate the HER activity on the system [72], where the smaller the ΔGH* absolute value usually means the better the HER activity. In this work, we also estimate the HER catalytic activity by computing the ΔGH* value via the formulas (1) and (2) in the computational methods.\nInitially, we focus on the monolayer structure 1L-GeP3, and as shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, its optimized lattice parameters (a= b=6.960 Å) is evidently smaller than the corresponding those of bulk GeP3 (a= b=7.106 Å), which is well consistent with the earlier report [47]. This can be mainly attributed to the case that in contrast to the bulk structure, the disappearance of strong interlayer interactions for the monolayer induces the increase of puckering height and contraction of lattice. Based on the optimized monolayer structure, we investigate the HER catalytic activity by evaluating the ΔGH* value, where all six possible adsorption sites are considered, including two top site of P/Ge atoms, two bond sites of P-P/Ge-P, and two hollow sites. After relaxation, we can ultimately obtain two structures with the H*\nadsorbed at the top sites of P and Ge atoms (denoted by TP and TGe, respectively), as illuminated in Fig. 2a. Our computed results reveal that the ΔGH* values for TGe and TP sites are as small as 0.003 and −0.056 eV, respectively (Fig. 2e and Table 1), both of which are very close to zero, indicating the considerably high HER catalytic activity on the GeP3 monolayer (1L-GeP3).\nFurthermore, we have performed the detailed mechanism analysis behind the high HER activity. Specifically, as for the TGe site on 1LGeP3, an evident electron transfer process occurs from Ge to the neighboring P atoms, leading to the loss of electron on Ge atom (the computed Bader charge is about 0.53|e|), which can effectively weaken the interaction between H and Ge atoms. On the other hand, when absorbing H* at the TGe site, the formed H-Ge-P angle (ca. 117°) is evidently larger than 109° in the regular sp3 hybridization, which will lead to the structural strain to further weaken the interaction between H and Ge. Overall, both of them can endow the H* with the optimum adsorption state at the TGe site, bringing an outstanding HER activity. It is noteworthy that the weakened GeeH bonding can be also reflected by the longer GeeH bond length (1.558 Å) in 1L-GeP3 than the corresponding GeeH single bond (1.544 Å).\nAs for the TP site on 1L-GeP3, we can find that three valence electrons for P atom are employed to participate in the formation of one GeeP and two PeP bonds. When the adsorption of H* interacting the top site of P atom, one valence electron from H and the remaining lone pair from P atom can form one fully filled bonding orbital (σP-H) and one partially filled antibonding orbital (σ*P-H). Therefore, the bonding strength between H and P can be determined by the occupancy of the partially filled antibonding orbital, that is, the higher σ*P-H occupancy, the weaker the bonding strength. The computed Bader charge shows that an evident electron transfer can occur from Ge to P atom (ca. −0.16|e| on P atom), resulting in a more filled p states of P atom and significantly increasing σ*P-H occupancy when H* adsorbing on the TP site. This can effectively weaken the bonding between H and P atom, and endow the TP site with the appropriate adsorption state of H*, leading to a high HER catalytic activity. It is worth mentioning that the weak PeH bonding can be also reflected by the correlative structural parameters, that is, the computed PeH bond length (1.432 Å) is longer than the single bond of PeH (1.407 Å). Obviously, the monolayer 1LGeP3 can possess high catalytic activity for HER, where all the P and Ge atoms can play an crucial role in determining the HER activity.\nSubsequently, we explore the effect of increasing the layer number on the HER activity of 2D nL-GeP3 systems by sampling n=2, 3 and 4. For comparison, the corresponding crystal surface (003) in bulk GeP3 structure is also considered. As illustrated in Fig. 2b–d, these fewlayered nL-GeP3 structures are constructed through the similar stacking mode to the bulk. Our computed results reveal that all of them can exhibit considerably high structure stabilities, as reflected by their large negative interlayer interaction energies (Eint =−3.459, −3.150 and −3.045 eV per supercell for n=2, 3 and 4, respectively (Table 1)) via the formula (3) in the computational methods.\nSimilar to the case of 1L-GeP3, all six possible adsorption sites are also considered to estimate ΔGH* values for nL-GeP3. And we ultimately obtain two adsorption sites of H* after relaxation, namely, TP and TGe sites. Our computed results show that while increasing the layer number n from 1 to 2, small ΔGH* values can be also observed on 2LGeP3 (0.250 and 0.409 eV for TGe and TP sites, respectively (Table 1)), indicating good HER catalytic activity, although these ΔGH* values are somewhat larger than those on 1L-GeP3. These increased ΔGH* values for the TP and TGe sites can be mainly attributed to the fact that the interlayer interaction brings the certain structural strain to weaken the adsorption of H at the TGe/TP sites. Further, when the layer number n is increased from 2 to 3 and 4 (even bulk), the computed ΔGH* values can exhibit a convergent trend in a range of 0.344–0.380 eV for TGe site and 0.307–0.471 eV for TP site, as presented in Fig. 2e and Table 1. This indicates that the increasing of layer number has a negligible effect on the HER catalytic activity of these systems beyond bilayer, and all these\n2D few-layered structures (even the bulk) can also possess good HER activity in view of the small ΔGH* value.\nMoreover, we also investigate the electronic property of nL-GeP3 systems by computing their density of states (DOS). It is well known that good conductivity can be advantageous for improving the HER activity of material. Our computed DOS results reveal that similar to the earlier report [47], 1L-GeP3 and 2L-GeP3 can exhibit a small band gap, while 3L-GeP3 and 4L-GeP3 can present the typical metallic behavior (Fig. 2), indicating the good conductivity. Overall, it is very promising that the 2D layered GeP3 structures can have an application in catalyzing the HER reaction in the water-splitting process."

      "heading" : "3.2. Further improving the HER catalytic activity on the 2D layered GeP3 systems by applying the surface strain",
      "text" : "From the above discussions, we can understand that the monolayer GeP3 can have a ΔGH* value close to zero but not metallic behavior, comparatively, the few-layered GeP3 structures can exhibit the metallic conductivity but a relatively larger ΔGH* value than the monolayer. In this section, we propose the effective strategy through employing the surface strain to further improve the HER activity for these 2D layered GeP3 nanomaterials by synchronously optimizing the adsorption state of H* (ΔGH*) and electronic structure of system.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, all these 2D layered GeP3 systems can present a typical puckered honeycomb structure, which can be advantageous to make it bear a large surface strain. Initially, the biaxial compressive or tensile strain is imposed in parallel to the surface plane by changing the lattice constants of unstrained nL-GeP3 structures. We firstly focus on the 1L-GeP3 system and compute the corresponding DOS and ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites under a series of biaxial strain ranging from −10% to 10%. As shown in Fig. 3, we can find that no matter what imposing the biaxial compressive or tensile strain, both the TP and TGe sites can uniformly exhibit the small ΔGH* values close to zero, indicating that the applied strain has a negligible effect on the adsorption state of H* on the monolayer surface, in view of good flexibility of monolayer structure.\nDifferent from the case of the computed ΔGH* values, it is revealed that the band gap of the monolayer 1L-GeP3 is sensitive to the biaxial\nstrain, as shown in Fig. 3. When increasing the applied tensile strain from 0 to 10%, the band gap of 1L-GeP3 can be gradually increased (up to ~0.5 eV). In contrast, applying the compressive strain can induce a monotonous decrease of band gap and then bring a conversion from the semiconducting to metallic behaviors under the strain of −5%; finally, the metallic characteristic can be sustained under the larger compressive strain (Fig. 3). Obviously, by combining these results above, we can conclude that applying the biaxial compressive strain is advantageous for further improving the HER activity on 1L-GeP3 monolayer, in view of the fact that it can effectively decrease the band gap to enhance the conductivity, simultaneously accompanied by the optimum ΔGH* value.\nSubsequently, we also perform the detailed computations on the ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites and DOS of 2D few-layered nL-GeP3 (n=2, 3 and 4) systems under the different biaxial strain from −6% to 10%. It is found that different from the case of 1L-GeP3, the ΔGH* values on 2L-GeP3 are very sensitive to the applied strain for both the TP and\nTGe sites, as illuminated in Fig. 4a–b. Specifically, when increasing the biaxial compressive strain from 0 to −6%, the ΔGH* values on 2L-GeP3 can be continuously increased from 0.409 to 0.593 eV at the TP site and from 0.250 to 0.522 eV at the TGe site, respectively (Fig. 4a–b). Comparatively, the ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites can be gradually decreased from 0.409/0.250 eV to 0.040/0.079 eV (close to zero), when increasing the biaxial tensile strain from 0 to 10% (Fig. 4a–b). This can be mainly attributed to the fact that along with the increase of the tensile strain, the correlative formed angles (with the P/Ge as the apex atom) after adsorbing H* can change towards the ideal value ~109° in the regular sp3 hybridization, making the relatively large and positive ΔGH* values become smaller, and then improving the HER catalytic activities at the TP/TGe sites.\nAdditionally, the similar changing trend of ΔGH* values can be also observed for the thicker 3L-GeP3 and 4L-GeP3 systems (Fig. 4a–b), that is, applying the biaxial compressive strain can increase the ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites, while imposing the biaxial tensile strain can effectively decrease the correlative ΔGH* values. Especially, we can find that the application of biaxial tensile strain of 8–10% can endow these fewlayered systems with the optimum ΔGH* values (close to zero). Additionally, all these 2D few-layered nL-GeP3 (n=2, 3 and 4) systems can uniformly exhibit the metallic behaviors under the biaxial tensile strain of 8–10%, indicating the good conductivity, as revealed by the computed DOS results (Fig. 4c). Obviously, imposing the biaxial compressive strain is adverse for improving the HER activity, while applying the biaxial tensile strain can effectively improve the HER activity for the few-layered nL-GeP3 (n≥ 2) systems.\nBesides, the uniaxial compressive or tensile strain is also imposed along the zigzag or armchair direction by changing the lattice constants of unstrained rectangular unit cell for nL-GeP3 structures. Initially, we focus on the 1L-GeP3 system and compute the corresponding DOS and ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites under a series of uniaxial strain ranging from −10% to 10%. Similar to the case of biaxial strain, we can find that no matter what imposing the uniaxial compressive or tensile strain along the armchair/zigzag direction, both the TP and TGe sites can uniformly exhibit the small ΔGH* values close to zero (Fig. 5), indicating that the applied uniaxial strain also has a negligible effect on the adsorption state of H* on the monolayer surface. However, the band gap\nof the monolayer 1L-GeP3 is sensitive to the uniaxial strain, as shown in Fig. 5. When increasing the applied tensile strain from 0 to 10% along the zigzag or armchair direction, the band gap of 1L-GeP3 can be gradually increased (up to ~0.4 eV). Comparatively, applying the uniaxial compressive strain from 0 to −10% along the armchair direction can also induce an increase of band gap of 1L-GeP3 (Fig. 5), while imposing the uniaxial compressive strain from 0 to −6% along the zigzag direction can induce a monotonous decrease of band gap (and even close to zero) and then the increased band gap can be observed under the larger compressive strain (Fig. 5). Clearly, imposing the uniaxial compressive strain with ranging from 0 to −6% along the armchair direction can be advantageous for further improving the HER activity on 1LGeP3 monolayer, in view of the enhanced conductivity and the sustainable optimum ΔGH* value.\nMoreover, we also perform the detailed computations on the ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites and DOS of 2D few-layered nL-GeP3 (n=2, 3 and 4) systems under the different uniaxial strain from −6% to 10% along the zigzag or armchair direction. We can find that like the case of biaxial strain, applying the uniaxial compressive strain can increase the ΔGH* values at the TP/TGe sites, while imposing the uniaxial tensile strain can effectively decrease the correlative ΔGH* values, regardless of the direction of the applied uniaxial strain (Fig. 6a–b). Particularly, it can be found that imposing the uniaxial tensile strain of 8–10% along the zigzag or armchair direction can also endow these few-layered systems with the optimum ΔGH* values. Meanwhile, all these 2D fewlayered nL-GeP3 (n=2, 3 and 4) systems can uniformly exhibit the metallic behaviors under the uniaxial tensile strain of 8–10%, indicating the good conductivity, as revealed by the computed DOS results (Fig. 6c). Clearly, imposing the uniaxial tensile strain along the zigzag or armchair direction can effectively improve the HER activity for the few-layered nL-GeP3 (n≥ 2) systems.\nOverall, imposing the biaxial or uniaxial strain can be an effective approach to enhance the HER catalytic activity for the 2D layered GeP3 systems by optimizing the adsorption state of H* or electronic property. Applying the compressive strain on the monolayer 1L-GeP3 but the tensile strain on the few-layered nL-GeP3 can endow all these 2D layered GeP3 structures with the optimum ΔGH* value and good conductivity at the same time, bringing the outstanding HER catalytic activity."

      "text" : "Usually, 2D nanomaterial can be coupled with graphene to build new hybrid nanostructure with more excellent physical and chemical properties [42,74,75]. In this section, we will construct a new kind of 2D composite nanomaterials by employing the monolayer GeP3 and\ngraphene as the building blocks, and further explore the HER activity. As illustrated in Fig. 7, we have constructed series of new 2D\ncomposite nanostructures by alternately stacking the monolayer GeP3 and graphene (G), all of which can uniformly exhibit the typical sandwich configuration with the exposed surfaces of GeP3 monolayer. For the convenience, these composite systems can be marked by nGeP3/G, where n means the total layer number of GeP3 and graphene.\nInitially, we investigate the thinnest 3-GeP3/G system with GeP3/G/ GeP3 stacking, as shown in Fig. 7a. The computed lattice parameter is a= b=7.315 Å and the distance between GeP3-layer and graphene is about 3.0 Å. The computed interaction energy (Eint) between two layers is negative as −0.135 eV per supercell (Table 2), indicating depositing the GeP3-layer on graphene is a favorable process in energy, and the resulting composite configuration can possess good structural stability. Moreover, the calculated Bader charge shows that only a weak electron transfer process occurs between the GeP3 monolayer and graphene.\nBased on the optimized structure of 3-GeP3/G, we compute the ΔGH* values to estimate the HER activity by considering all possible adsorption sites, and both the TP and TGe sites can be finally obtained (Fig. 7a). Our computed results reveal that like the pure 1L-GeP3, the ΔGH* values at the TP and TGe sites are −0.003 and −0.035 eV for 3- GeP3/G, respectively, both of which are very close to zero, indicating high HER catalytic activity (Fig. 7d and Table 2). On the other hand, the computed DOS result shows that different from the pure 1L-GeP3, coupling graphene can endow the composite 3-GeP3/G system with the better conductivity (Fig. 7a). Clearly, the 2D composite 3-GeP3/G nanosystem can exhibit much higher HER catalytic activity, in view of the optimum ΔGH* values and the good conductivity.\nSubsequently, we focus on the thicker 5-GeP3/G and 7-GeP3/G systems to explore the effect of layer number on the structure and HER activity of 2D n-GeP3/G system. Our computed results reveal that both the composite systems can have the slightly larger lattice parameters (7.335–7.344 Å) (Table 2) and smaller interlayer distance (2.928–2.992 Å) than the 3-GeP3/G system, which can be due to the increased interlayer interaction in the thicker system. Indeed, along with the increase of layer number, the computed Eint values can become more negative, which are −0.240 and− 0.280 eV for 5-GeP3/G and 7- GeP3/G, respectively (Table 2), indicating the higher structural stability.\nFurthermore, we compute the ΔGH* values on 5-GeP3/G and 7- GeP3/G, where all the possible adsorption sites are considered and both the TP and TGe sites can be gotten finally. It can be found that similar to 3-GeP3/G, both the thicker composite systems can also possess very small ΔGH* values (close to zero) at the TP/TGe sites, which are −0.019/−0.048 eV for 5-GeP3/G and −0.004/−0.034 eV for 7-GeP3/ G, respectively (Fig. 7d and Table 2). Additionally, like the case of 3- GeP3/G, both the thicker 5-GeP3/G and 7-GeP3/G systems can uniformly exhibit good conductivity, as revealed by the computed DOS results (Fig. 7b–c).\nObviously, by combining the optimum adsorption state of H* and good conductivity, all these 2D composite sandwich n-GeP3/G systems can uniformly exhibit considerably high HER catalytic activity, regardless of the layer number. It can be very promising way through coupling graphene to effectively enhance the HER activity on GeP3 system."

      "text" : "By means of the DFT computations, we have performed the systemic investigations to explore the HER catalytic activity of the 2D layered GeP3-based systems. The following intriguing findings can be obtained:\n(1) The computed ΔGH* values on the monolayer GeP3 can be close to zero, and along with the increase of layer number into 2, 3 and 4 (even bulk), the computed ΔGH* values are still small and exhibit a converged trend with ranging from 0.250 to 0.471 eV. It is revealed\n(2) Applying the biaxial or uniaxial strain can effectively improve the HER catalytic activity of these 2D layered GeP3 systems by modulating the adsorption state of H* or the electronic property. By imposing the compressive strain on the monolayer 1L-GeP3 and the tensile strain on the few-layered nL-GeP3, all these 2D layered GeP3 structures can be even endowed with the optimum ΔGH* value and good conductivity at the same time, exhibiting the outstanding HER catalytic activity.\n(3) By alternately stacking the monolayer GeP3 and graphene, we have constructed series of new sandwich nanostructures n-GeP3/G (n=3, 5 and 7) with the exposed surfaces of GeP3 monolayer. Independent of the layer number, all these 2D composite systems can also exhibit the excellent HER catalytic activity, in view of the optimum adsorption state of H* (ΔGH*≈ 0) and good conductivity.\nObviously, this work can provide valuable theoretical insights at the atomic level for understanding the high HER activity for the 2D layered\nFig. 6. The computed ΔGH* values at the TGe (a) and TP (b) sites as a function of uniaxial compressive/ tensile strain ranging from −6% to 10% along the zigzag or armchair direction for 2D few-layered nLGeP3 (n=2, 3 and 4) nanosystems. (c) The calculated total density of states of nL-GeP3 (n=2, 3 and 4) under the different uniaxial strain including 0%, 8% and 10% along the zigzag or armchair direction.\nFig. 7. (a–c) The structures of 2D composite n-GeP3/G (n=3, 5 and 7) nanosystems with sandwich configuration from the top and side views, as well as the corresponding density of states. Note that the pink, green and black spheres denote P, Ge and C atoms, respectively. (d) The maintained ΔGH* values (close to zero) along with the increasing of layer number, where the black and red lines are corresponding to the TP and TGe sites for n-GeP3/G (n=3, 5 and 7) as well as 1L-GeP3.\nGeP3 systems, and we have proposed two kinds of effective strategies (i.e. imposing the surface strain and coupling with graphene) to further improve their HER activities. Accompanied by the good structural stability, the 2D GeP3-based nanomaterials can be promising candidate as the highly efficient HER electrocatalyst. All these fascinating findings can be advantageous for promoting the potential application of excellent GeP3-based nanomaterials in catalyzing the water splitting process.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no competing financial interest."

Our computed results reveal that the monolayer and few-layered GeP3 systems can exhibit the good HER activity, where both the top sites over Ge and P atoms can serve as the most active sites. The correlative catalytic mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Further, we propose the effective strategy through applying the external strain to enhance the HER activity of these 2D layered GeP3 systems by optimizing the adsorption state of H* (ΔGH*) or electronic property. Imposing the compressive strain on the monolayer GeP3 and the tensile strain on the few-layered GeP3 can simultaneously endow them with the optimum ΔGH* value and good conductivity, bringing higher HER activity. Moreover, we have also constructed series of new sandwich nanostructures by alternately stacking the monolayer GeP3 and graphene, and all of them can uniformly exhibit the outstanding HER activity, due to the optimum ΔGH* value and good conductivity. Obviously, all these fascinating findings can be advantageous for achieving the highly efficient and nonprecious HER electrocatalysts based on the excellent GeP3 nanomaterials in the near future.",
