In this study, the beneficial effects of dietary nano cerium oxide (nano CeO2) as a potent antioxidant were examined in the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Crabs were fed a diet supplemented with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, or 12.8 mg/kg nano CeO2 for 60 d. The optimum supplementation level of nano CeO2 that significantly increased weight gain rate and decreased feed coefficient was 0.8 mg/kg. This level also offered immune protection when crabs were kept under ammonia nitrogen stress and/or exposed to pathogen infection (Aeromonas hydrophila). Supplementation with 0.8 mg/kg of CeO2 (i) relieved pathological damage to the hepatopancreas; (ii) increased hemocyte counts, including total number of hemocytes, granulocytes, and hyalinocytes; (iii) decreased malondialdehyde content and increased antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hemolymph; (iv) increased the activities of lysozyme, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase in the hemolymph; and (v) increased gene and protein expression of cathepsin L in the hepatopancreas. Mortality increased when crabs were injected with bacteria under ammonia nitrogen stress, but dietary supplementation with 0.8 mg/kg nano CeO2 decreased the mortality rate. Thus, the results of this study suggested that dietary supplementation with nano CeO2 in crabs promoted growth and up-regulated immunity to bacterial infection under ammonia nitrogen stress."

      "text" : "Urban development and human activities are increasing the ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N) content in freshwater and marine water, which can influence aquatic ecosystems and the quality of life of aquatic inhabitants [1–3]. NH3–N is a major end product of protein catabolism, and its buildup in water becomes a limiting factor for health of aquatic animal in high density intensive breeding systems where aquaculture species live in most of their lives [4]. Thus, high NH3–N content in water has negative consequences for the aquatic animal breeding industry. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to high concentrations of NH3–N in water can hinder the growth of animals, decrease their immunity, and increase their susceptibility to pathogens [5,6]. Therefore, studies of the toxicity of NH3–N in water and protection measures have become a hot topic in the aquaculture all over the world.\nNative freshwater crabs have special economic value in China. The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) is widely cultured throughout the eastern part of mainland China [7]. Since the early 1990s, the crabbreeding industry has made considerable progress [8], and pond culture has become the most important method of Chinese mitten crab breeding industrialization [9]. Water quality is the primary factor influencing the growth of crabs, which are more sensitive to un-ionized ammonia (NH3) [10,11]. Increased NH3–N content in water has been reported to reduce hemolymph cell number and hemocyanin levels, suppress the hemocyte phagocytosis rate, decrease the activities of lysozyme and phenol oxidase, and destroy the immune defense system, including nonspecific immune cells and immune response factors in the hemolymph [12–14]. Increased NH3–N in water also was reported to reduce immunity against pathogens and the ability of crabs to remove free radicals [15–17]. These studies suggested that the free radicalmediated pathway was involved in the adverse effects of NH3–N\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.06.019 Received 18 February 2019; Received in revised form 6 June 2019; Accepted 10 June 2019\n∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author.

Cerium (Ce) is a rare earth element that the National Research\nCouncil of the National Academies (NRC) in USA does not classify as an essential nutrient; however, in East Asia it is widely used as a growth promoter for aquaculture species and livestock [18]. Ce has a wide range of biological activities, including bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, growth promotion, resistance to oxidative stress, and immune regulation [19–23]. Nano cerium oxide (CeO2) particles are small (6–25 nm), and their absorption efficiency is much higher than that of traditional cerium nitrate and CeO2 [24]. These features allow nano CeO2 to achieve an observable supplement effect at a lower usage dose and reduce environmental residues of this rare earth element [25]. As an immune enhancer, the immune function of nano CeO2 mainly comes from its antioxidant capability [26]. At the nano scale, Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+ to stabilize surface oxygen defects. Therefore, Ce3+ and Ce4+\nin nano CeO2 particles can be reversibly transformed, which makes nano CeO2 an antioxidant that can be recycled [27]. It has been reported that CeO2 is a free radical scavenger with a long half-life, which allows it to catalyze the decomposition of excessive free radicals, reduce the potential damage caused by free radicals, and protect the integrity of proteins and DNA [28,29]. Nano CeO2 also provides a protective effect against certain harmful environmental factors by enhancing the activity of natural killer cells and the expression of immune factors, thereby improving the immune ability of the body and protecting hematopoietic tissue from damage in vivo [30,31].\nPathogens are important factors that can induce disease, affect growth, and even cause death of crabs. The bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila is widespread in fresh water and can induce disease in many aquatic animals, resulting in growth retardation and in outbreaks of ascites infection, edema, enteritis, and liver necrobacillosis in Eriocheir sinensis [32]. Hematocytes are the major cellular components of the crustacean immune system, and they clear pathogens by adhering to them, triggering phagocytosis, and producing highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) [33,34]. However, ROS are highly reactive molecules that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes, resulting in pathological damage to tissues [35,36]. Nano CeO2 particles are known to catalyze the decomposition of ROS such as superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide because of their superoxide dismutase (SOD)like and catalase (CAT)-like activities [37].\nThe goals of this study were to determine whether the adverse health effects of NH3–N on Eriocheir sinensis can be prevented by dietary supplementation with nano CeO2 and whether nano CeO2 can promote Eriocheir sinensis growth and resistance to the pathogen A. hydrophila."

Next, 1 mmol of ammonia water was added to the mixture, which was stirred for 30min at room temperature. The product was transferred to a 50mL Teflon lined autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, then washed several times with ethanol and ultrapure water. Finally, the CeO2 powder was obtained by drying the precipitates in an oven at 60 °C for 2 h. Structural analysis of CeO2 nanocrystals was performed using a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with an Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) accessory and an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Bruker AXS, Billerica, MA, USA) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å)."

The crabs were immediately transferred to plastic tanks (300 L) in the Aquatic Laboratory of Soochow University. The animals were kept at a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle and held in tanks equipped with pre-aerated running water obtained from municipal waterworks at a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C. The quality parameters of water were maintained daily at pH, 7.86 ± 0.05; salinity, 0.3%; oxygen concentration, 6.3 ± 0.2mg/L; total ammonia 0.35 ± 0.02mg/L; and basal nitrite< 0.05mg/L. The crabs were fed with basic pellets twice daily at 3% of body weight. Fecal matter was removed from each tank daily, and the water exchange rate was 20% per day. Four hundred crabs were randomly divided into eight groups of 50 each. They were fed for 60 d with diets supplemented with nano CeO2 (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, or 12.8mg/kg). Their weights were recorded on alternate days. The weight gain rate (WGR) and feed coefficient (FC) were determined as follows, and the optimum addition level of nano CeO2 was obtained.\nWGR=100%× (Wt - W0) / W0\nFC = F/(Wt - W0)\nNotes: The crab mineral premix provided the following per 100 g: NaH2PO4 3.5 g, KH2PO4 6.0 g, CaCO3 3.5 g, KCl 0.6 g, MgSO4·7H2O 3.2 g, AlCl3·6H2O 0.55 g, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.157 g, ferric citrate 0.019 g, MnSO4·4–6H2O 0.043 g, KI 0.016 g, CuCl2 0.014 g, CoCl2·6H2O 0.055 g, calcium lactate 5.15 g.\nWhere W0 is the initial average weight (g); Wt is the final average weight (g); and F is the consumed feed weight (g).\nExperiment II was conducted to determine whether dietary nano CeO2 could relieve the stress induced by NH3–N and enhance crab resistance to bacterial infection by regulating immunity. In this experiment, 720 crabs (10.79 ± 0.62 g) were randomly divided into control and nano CeO2 experimental groups. The control group received 0mg/ kg nano CeO2 in the diet, whereas the experimental group received 0.8 mg/kg nano CeO2: this dosage was based on the best WGR and FC levels observed in experiment I. At the end of 90 d, each group was divided into three sub-groups: blank, NH3–N stress, and double stress of NH3–N and A. hydrophila infection (NH3–N + A. hydrophila) (Table 3). Crabs in the latter group were injected with A. hydrophila (Strain CL99920) bacterial suspension (4× 106 CFU/kg diluted with saline) through the third pereiopoda basipodite before exposure or not to NH3–N (25mg/L). After 96 h, the number of dead crabs was recorded to determine the efficiency of immune protection provided by nano CeO2. Each live crab was sacrificed and hemolymph was collected and stored in a heparin sodium anticoagulant tube to determine hemocyte counts, antioxidant index (SOD, CAT, and malondialdehyde (MDA)), and immune enzyme activities (lysozyme (LZM), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP)). Half of the hepatopancreas was used for the histopathology assay, and the other half was stored at −80 °C to measure the expression level of cathepsin L using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses. The immune protection efficiency was calculated for each treatment using the following formula: (control mortality rate - nano CeO2 mortality rate)× 100/ control mortality rate. Each experiment was repeated three times, and each repeat contained 40 crabs kept in two tanks."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "Nano CeO2 is an oxide of a rare earth element, and due to its antioxidative properties it has potential uses in biomedical applications, such as protecting cells against radiation damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation [20,37]. The small size of nano CeO2 particles allows them to enter the cells in vitro via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where they can be distributed to multiple subcellular compartments such as the cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus [39]. In hens, dietary supplementation with CeO2 (50 nm) was reported to increase egg laying and up-regulate mRNA expression of digestive enzyme activities such as pancreatic amylase and trypsin [40]. In the current study, Chinese mitten crabs were fed a diet supplemented with different levels of nano CeO2 (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, and 12.8 mg/kg) for 60 d. The optimum supplementation level was 0.8mg/ kg nano CeO2 based on WGR and FC, thus this dosage could provide an economic benefit to the aquaculture industry.\nIn the next experiment, crabs were fed a diet supplemented with either 0mg/kg or 0.8 mg/kg nano CeO2 for 90 d; crabs in each group then were randomly divided into three subgroups (blank, NH3–N, NH3–N + A. hydrophila), and they were treated with or without single NH3–N stress or the double stress of NH3–N and A. hydrophila for 96 h. NH3–N stress increased the mortality of crabs, whereas the diet supplemented with nano CeO2 decreased the mortality of crabs under NH3–N stress. Higher levels of NH3–N have been shown to have harmful effects on the immune system [41]; for example, phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of pathogenic bacteria decreased in crustaceans living in water containing high NH3–N concentration [42]. In the current study, the mortality rate of crabs infected with A. hydrophila under NH3–N stress was reduced when they were given a diet supplemented with nano CeO2 (0.8 mg/kg) for 90 d. These results suggested that dietary nano CeO2 lowered the mortality risk of crabs that was induced by elevated NH3–N levels and increased immune protection from bacterial infection under NH3–N stress. In other words, a diet containing nano CeO2 0.8 mg/kg alleviated immune damage under NH3–N stress.\nCrustaceans have a primitive immune system that depends mainly on phagocytosis, wrapping, and agglutination [43]. A cellular response mediated by hemocytes, which constitutively induce LZM and antimicrobial peptides to dissolve the invading microorganisms, is an important method of immune resistance [33,44]. Hemocytes play an important role in the immune response of crustaceans [45]. A common evaluation index of the immune status of crustaceans is the change in THC, which reflects cellular immunity and the secretion of humoral immune factors [46]. It was previously reported that NH3–N stress or A. hydrophila infection both significantly reduced the number of hemocytes in E. sinensis [47,48]. In the present study, 96 h of NH3–N stress decreased the THC in the hemolymph of the crabs, and the double stress of NH3–N exposure and A. hydrophila infection induced an even greater reduction in THC. LGC in the hemolymph showed similar changes under the same stress conditions. However, HC and SGC varied in different ways. Overall, dietary supplementation with nano CeO2 (0.8 mg/ kg) significantly improved the THC, LGC, and HC in the hemolymph of crabs under NH3–N stress alone or in combination with A. hydrophila infection for 96 h.\nHemocytes produce highly toxic ROS and trigger phagocytosis [49]. In this study, 96 h of NH3–N stress increased the levels of MDA in the hemolymph of crabs, and the double stress of A. hydrophila infection\nand NH3–N exposure induced an even sharper increase in MDA level. However, the activities of CAT and SOD decreased significantly. Thus, these results suggested that the decreased immunity induced by NH3–N stress may have been due to oxidative injury. Nano CeO2 has been shown to possess antioxidant properties and to scavenge superoxide radicals [50]. Furthermore, nano CeO2 was shown to induce SOD and CAT activities in a cell-free system [51,52]. In our previous studies, nano CeO2 prevented damage induced by sleep deprivation by improving the antioxidant capacity of tissue in mice [53]. In the current study, dietary supplementation with nano CeO2 (0.8 mg/kg) significantly increased activities of SOD and CAT and decreased the level of MDA in the hemolymph of crabs under NH3–N stress alone or the double stress of NH3–N and pathogen infection. These observations suggested that nano CeO2 reduced the oxidative stress induced by NH3–N or the double stress of NH3–N and pathogen infection.\nThe body fluids of crustaceans do not contain immunoglobulins for an antibody-mediated immune response, but they do contain enzymes that participate in immune reactions, such as LZM, AKP, and ACP [54]. LZM is mainly produced by neutrophils and mononuclear cells, although a small amount is produced by macrophages [55] and is important for phagocyte sterilization. NH3–N stress for 96 h was shown to promote the activities of LZM, AKP, and ACP in the hemolymph serum of the crab Scylla paramamosain, indicating that short-term treatment with NH3–N caused a stress response in crabs and enhanced their disease resistance [6]. The results of the current study are consistent with the above reports. The combined action of the two stress factors (NH3–N and pathogenic bacteria) induced similar changes, whereas dietary nano CeO2 increased the activities of LZM, AKP, and ACP.\nCathepsin L, a lysosomal cysteine protease, is an important member of the cathepsin family, which plays critical roles in a variety of biological processes, such as immune responses [56], molting [57], and antigen processing [58]. Cathepsin L exhibits strong endopeptidase activity in the degradation of intracellular and extracellular protein and may play an important role in the defense against pathogens in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii [59]. It also acts as a biomarker of exposure of crustaceans to harmful environmental factors in water [60]. Cathepsin L is known to be associated with the evolution of the innate\nimmune system and serves as a chemical barrier against microbial invasion [61]. In previous studies, the enzyme activity and mRNA and protein expression of cathepsin L were reported to be significantly upregulated in the hepatopancreas of Pacific abalone and freshwater mussels after 8 h of Vibrio parahaemolyticus or A. hydrophila infection [62,63]. In the present study, gene and protein expression of cathepsin L decreased significantly after 96 h of exposure to NH3–N alone or to NH3–N + A. hydrophila double stress. These results were not consistent with the above reports, but the difference may be due to the different exposure durations. Supplementation with dietary nano CeO2 for 90 d increased the gene and protein expression of cathepsin L in the hepatopancreas of crabs exposed to NH3–N stress or the combined stress of NH3–N and A. hydrophila infection.\nTo evaluate the safety of using nano CeO2 in aquatic products, we measured the Ce concentration of the edible hepatopancreas in crabs fed a diet supplemented with 0.8mg/kg nano CeO2 for 90 d. Compared to the crabs without nano CeO2 supplementation, the levels of Ce in the hepatopancreas of crabs supplemented with 0.8mg/kg nano CeO2 increased from 0.4949 to 0.6805mg/kg. However, the overall Ce content in the crab hepatopancreas was below 0.700mg/kg, which was lower than values that have been reported in rice (average value, 0.75mg/kg) and wheat (average value, 1.5mg/kg) [64]. It should be noted that NRC has not established maximum tolerable levels of Ce, but it stated that dietary concentrations of 100mg/kg should be considered safe [18].\nIn conclusion, supplementation with 0.8 mg/kg dietary nano CeO2 (nanoparticles, 5 nm) significantly increased the growth of juvenile crabs and the efficiency of feed utilization. The supplementation also increased survival of crabs exposed to NH3–N and/or A. hydrophila by up-regulating immunity as showed in Fig. 9. This is the first study that shows the beneficial effects of adding nano CeO2 to the diet of E. sinensis, which include increased immune parameters and protection against NH3–N exposure or pathogen infection under ammonium-N stress.\nDeclaration of interest\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest.

    "abstractText" : "Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in ammonia nitrogen toxicity. In this study, the beneficial effects of dietary nano cerium oxide (nano CeO2) as a potent antioxidant were examined in the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Crabs were fed a diet supplemented with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, or 12.8 mg/kg nano CeO2 for 60 d. The optimum supplementation level of nano CeO2 that significantly increased weight gain rate and decreased feed coefficient was 0.8 mg/kg. This level also offered immune protection when crabs were kept under ammonia nitrogen stress and/or exposed to pathogen infection (Aeromonas hydrophila). Supplementation with 0.8 mg/kg of CeO2 (i) relieved pathological damage to the hepatopancreas; (ii) increased hemocyte counts, including total number of hemocytes, granulocytes, and hyalinocytes; (iii) decreased malondialdehyde content and increased antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hemolymph; (iv) increased the activities of lysozyme, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase in the hemolymph; and (v) increased gene and protein expression of cathepsin L in the hepatopancreas. Mortality increased when crabs were injected with bacteria under ammonia nitrogen stress, but dietary supplementation with 0.8 mg/kg nano CeO2 decreased the mortality rate. Thus, the results of this study suggested that dietary supplementation with nano CeO2 in crabs promoted growth and up-regulated immunity to bacterial infection under ammonia nitrogen stress.",
