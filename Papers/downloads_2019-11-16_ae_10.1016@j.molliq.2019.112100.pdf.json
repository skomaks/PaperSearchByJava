To understand the change in chemical states, surface and crystal structure of the obtained Pt-Co@GO nanomaterials, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyseswere used. Pt-Co@GO nanomaterials exhibit a high adsorption effect in the methylene blue (MB) removal from the aqueous medium. The parameters including ultrasonic irradiation method contact time (1–90 min), initial dye concentration, temperature (293–323 K) and pH (4–10) were investigated for removal MB using Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent. The kinetic studies show that the MB adsorption processes can be described by pseudo-firstorder, the pseudo-second-order model, and intraparticle diffusion. Thermodynamic activation functions including enthalpy change (ΔH0), Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0), and entropy change (ΔS0) were determined. The maximum adsorption capacity of the synthesized Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent reaches 273.6 mg/g under the condition that the pH 10, 318 K and the initial dye concentration is 3.0 × 10−5 M. It is understood from the obtained data, Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent has demonstrated to be an effective nano-adsorbent for removing MB under several parameters in aqueous solution by ultrasonic process systems.\n© 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V."

      "text" : "Dyestuffs used for different purposes in many areas of the industry such as printing, food industry, textile, cosmetics and plastics industry are one of the most significant reasons for environmental pollution [1]. These dyes have been a threat to the living environment of humans and microorganisms due to their toxic effects, and different dyestuffs have been used in different fields of industry for many years [2]. One of the most common harmful dyestuffs is methylene blue. Methylene blue is a cationic dye utilized in different industries like textile and wood [3]. The chemical structure of MB is given in Fig. 1.

Burhan, et al., Synthe cular Liquids, https://doi.org/\nproblem. This is a danger to the environment and living organisms. Recently, various applications have been developed to remove of MB and other harmful dyes in aqueous media using different technology methods [4–9].\nMany physical, chemical and biological techniques like adsorption process [10,11], biosorption mechanism [12], photo-composition system [13] and ultrafiltration [14] have been used to eliminate this negative effect. The adsorption process has proved to be an extremely attractive and important process to wastewater treatment containing dyes because of its user-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and easy design [15,16]. Apart from the adsorption capacity of the different support materials used in adsorption studies, the functional groups and surface structure of the adsorbents are very crucial [17,18]. Various materials such as diatomite [19], krill clay [20], polymer composite film [21], GO-chitosan [22,23] and green clay [24] have been used to remove anionic and cationic-based dyes in wastewater. Recently, nanocomposite particles containing carbon, polymer, and magnetic materials are preferred as the new sorbent as a support material to remove organic wastes in aqueous media due to their high adsorption properties\nsis, characterization, kinetics and adsorption properties of Pt-Co@GO 10.1016/j.molliq.2019.112100\n[4,25]. After the discovery of graphenematerial by Geim andNovoselov, it has been extensively evaluated [26–28] due to its high quality electronic [29,30], magnetic, [31], thermal [32] and optical properties [33,34]. Due to these extraordinary properties of graphene material, it is preferred in many different fields including battery [35] and sensor studies [36,37], electrochemistry [38], supercapacitor technology [39] and adsorption [40] process applications. The GO material is well dispersed in such a way as to form a colloidal stable suspension in pure water because of the existence of hydroxyl, carbonyl, epoxide, and carboxyl groups. This may give the possibility to produce different GObased nanocomposite materials [41,42]. Recently, bimetallic alloys such as platinum-based Co [43–45], Ni [46,47], Cr [48] and Fe [49,50] have been widely produced as supporting agent for different purposes [51–55]. In this study, graphene oxide-supported bimetallic Pt-Co (PtCo@GO) nanocomposites were synthesized and characterized to remove dyestuffs. The resulting Pt-Co@GO nanocomposite has an extremely high potential for removing dyestuffs in aqueous solution media in ultrasonic process. The influence of different parameters such as the efficiency of absorbent, initial dye concentration, H2O2 concentration, pH, and ultrasonic power (US) on the removal of MB was studied under certain standard parameters. Concentration of MB was then determined using an UV–vis spectrometer, with a maximum absorbancewavelength for MB at 613 nm and 665 nm. In addition, the reaction mechanism and the thermodynamic function parameters were examined. The results revealed that MB can be effectively removed by Pt-Co@GO nanocomposite particles in the aqueous solution medium via ultrasonic process system."

XRD analyses of Pt-Co@ GO nano-adsorbent shown in Fig. 2 were performed to understand the crystalline form of the nano-adsorbent. As it is seen in Fig. 2, some distinct peaks around 2θ = 40.1°, 46.2°, 67.5°, and 81.6° correspond to Pt (111), Pt (200), Pt (220), Pt (310) crystal structure, respectively. The XRD analyses revealed that Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent has a facedcentered cubic (fcc) form with its average crystalline particles size of 3.57 nm and this value is so close to the particle size found in TEM patterns for Pt-Co@GOnano-adsorbent. The XRD analyses also showed that C (002) plane was observed in about 2θ=11.6°. When XRD patterns of Pt-Co@GO and Pt@GO were compared, it could be said that there was a small shift to higher binding energy which indicates the formation of alloy structure in prepared nano-adsorbent. Further, HR-TEM and TEM analyses (Fig. 3) of Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent were done to determine the structural morphology of the nano-adsorbent and the Pt-Co metal distributions on GO.

Additionally, TEM analysis revealed that the Pt-Co@ GO nano-adsorbent was present in a homogenous structure andmonodisperse distributions of Pt-Co were observed on GO support. Additionally, by investigating the TEM patterns in Fig. 3, it could be seen that no agglomeration was occurred in the structure of Pt-Co@GO nanoadsorbent.\nThe Raman spectroscopies analyses, given in Fig. 4, were performed to obtain more detailed information about the Pt-Co@GO nanoadsorbent structure. The functionalized structure of GO as support material containing Pt-Co nanoparticles was determined by Raman spectroscopy. The characteristic D and G bands were observed at 1349 and 1604 cm−1 in Fig. 4 correspond to hybridization of carbon of sp3 and sp2, respectively. The intensity ratios ID/IG for GO and Pt-Co@GO nanoparticles were found to be 0.95 and 1.07, respectively. This increasing value can indicate the functionalization of GOwith the help of Pt and Co.\nThe oxidation state of Pt and Co metals in the chemical composition of synthesized Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent were investigated by XPS analysis (Fig. 5).

The peaks of Pt2+ correspond to 72.3 eV and 75.6 eV, respectively. The obtained values showed that the availability of some of the oxidized species on the nano-adsorbent surface. The reason for this situation is the result of the oxidation formed during the preparation of the nano-adsorbent [62]. 2p3/2 spectrum region of Co corresponds to 778.8 eV and 795.1 eV in Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbents which show the most of Co in a metallic state. The presence of a small amount of Co2+ ions (783.5 eV and 800.4 eV) in the nano-adsorbent structure can be inferred from the oxidation."

      "text" : "The amount of nano-adsorbent concentration is one of themost significant parameters for the removal of methylene blue in solution medium. To observe the effects of nano-adsorbent in the adsorption process, it was analyzed under the experimental conditions at pH 9 for 90 min in solutions including 1.5 mM H2O2, the amount of nanoadsorbent in the range of 18–40 mg in 298 K, US power of 350 W. As shown in Fig. 6a, the maximum value for the 0.0032 g of Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent dose of the extraction efficiency of methylene blue was reached (approximately 91% yield). This can be explained by the increment in the surface area owing to the increase in nano-adsorbent mass, which is naturally associated with growing the number of active sites for adsorption [63]. The amount ofMB adsorbed per unit nanocomposite mass reduced with increasing nanoparticle mass because of the decrease in the effective surface area. This can be explained by the overlap or accumulation of active sites in the adsorption process. In this case, it may cause a reduction in the total surface area of the nano-adsorbent\nsis, characterization, kinetics and adsorption properties of Pt-Co@GO 10.1016/j.molliq.2019.112100\nFig. 5. XPS patterns of platinum 4f (a) and cobalt 2p regions (b) in the synthesized nano-adsorbent.\npresent for methylene blue and an increase in the greater length of the diffusion pathway for the adsorption interaction [10,64]. Also, a greater increment in the amount of concentration of nano-adsorbent particles into the solution medium may have led to a reduction in the effectiveness of methylene blue removal in the sono-adsorption processes. By adding nano-adsorbent, it may perform the function of separating OH radicals in solution medium, resulting in a reduction in the removal efficiency of methylene blue in the process medium [65]. The effect of methylene blue concentration on Pt-Co@GO nanocomposite adsorption was investigated in the range of 60–120 mg L−1, and the adsorption studies were characterized under constant parameter conditions such as 298 K temperatures starting from pH of 9.0 and 0.0032mg adsorbent dose (Fig. 6). The dye concentration in the adsorption process has a significant warming effect on all available mass transfer resistances between the liquid and the solid. In this case, the increase in the amount of dyestuff concentration will contribute positively to the adsorption process [66]. The nano-adsorbent particles to absorb the energy generated by acoustic cavitation prevent nano-adsorbent particles with increasing dye concentration [67]. The concentration of methylene blue was increased in the range of 40–120 mg L−1. In this case, methylene blue removal efficacy was observed to decrease from 90.45% to 76.45% in 90 min. Nano-adsorbent particles that absorb the energy generated by acoustic cavitation prevent nano-adsorbent particles with increasing dye concentration. In this way, it adversely affects the production of OH radicals and the efficacy of dye removal. In addition, intermediates formed by the interaction of methylene blue molecules with OH– radicals can be explained as another reason for reducing the efficiency of extraction by competing with the dyestuff [68]."

(2) and (3), the excess hydrogen peroxide molecule added to the process medium can cause the sweeping effect of the radicals [70], which may lead to a reduction of the radicals required for oxidation [71,72]. When the ultrasonic power effect was enhanced from 350 W to 450 W at certain fixed parameters, it was observed that it had a positive effect on adsorption efficiency (Fig. 6d). The increase in ultrasound power causes dissolution turbulence in aqueous solution. This results in an increment in the mass transfer rate of both reactive radicals and dyestuff to the solution medium [73]. Furthermore, the increase in ultrasonic power has been thought to contribute positively to the absorption of dyestuffs owing to the further expansion of the active areas on the nanoadsorbent surface [73,74]."

In the study, it was noticed that the adsorption capacity enhanced the amount of MB adsorbed by Pt-Co@GO with the temperature rising from 298 to 328 K. The increase in temperature in the dye adsorption process increased the movement of the molecules of the dye. In this case, the dyestuff may obtain adequate energy to interact with the active areas on the surface [75]. However, the temperature factor influenced the structure of the inner pores of the nanoparticle particles and the rate of diffusion of the methylene blue.

In addition, the effect of the temperature factor on the removal of dyestuff with the support particle was investigated. The optimum temperature for adsorption was found to be 318 K, and the adsorption\ncapacity of the Pt-Co@GO nano adsorbent decreased above 318 K as seen in Fig. 6e. The maximum adsorption capacities of Pt-Co@GO were compared to other mostly used adsorbents (see Table 1). Maximum\nadsorption capacity (qm) was found to be about 273.6 mg g−1 at 318 K. The initial pH of the solutions in the adsorption processes, in general, is an extremely important parameter. Because the pH variable in adsorption studies affects the surface charge of a support adsorbent and the ionization behavior of the dye molecule with the support material (Fig. 6f). It reflects the adsorption effect of MB on Pt-Co@GO at different pH values. At pH of 4, Pt-Co@GO achieved a lower dye removal percentage as 72.24%. This can be explained by the competition between the molecules of methylene blue with the proton ion for adsorption sites [77]. By growing the pH of the solution medium, the removal of the dyestuff was achieved by a value of up to 90.84%. This may be due to the interaction of the greater binding site and the functional group by increasing the complex surface ability of the adsorbent [78]. Furthermore, the increase of OH– radicals in the solution medium enhanced the dye removal at high pH. This is related to increased dissociation by the release of OH radicals of H2O2 molecules in the ultrasonic-based adsorption process [79]. Consequently, the existence of OH % radicals in the solution medium also affects the electrostatic attraction among dye and nano-adsorbent. Therefore, the most effective dyestuff removal was obtained at pH 10 (Fig. 6f).\nPlease cite this article as: M.S. Nas, M.H. Calimli, H.

The comparison of some parameters investigated for the removal of methylene blue with based Pt-Co@GO nano-support materials and their re-usability efficiency\nThe experiments of methylene blue removal performed under different parameter conditions in aqueous solution medium are shown in Fig. 7a. As shown in Fig. 7a, the removal efficiency of MB using PtCo@GO increased with increasing of MB concentration under common experimental conditions as conducted for the other parameters. As seen that Pt-Co@GO showed the best activity compared to other conditions for the removal of methylene blue by the nano-adsorbent. In this case, the transformation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to free radical (OH−) in the ultrasonic working process can be explained by positively increasing the oxidation process (as in Eq. (6)). Another reason is that under the operating conditions of US/Pt-Co@GO/H2O2, the nanoadsorbent contact area is further enhanced by the interaction of nanostructures with ultrasonic waves and thus contributed positively to the removal of dyestuffs [79]. It also increases the efficiency of dye removal in the heterogeneous catalytic process due to the formation of cavitation microbubbles on the surface of the magnetic nanoadsorbent [86,87].

(6) was employed to calculate the half time of the adsorption process for methylene with nano-adsorbent under ultrasonic wave irradiations. With the equations given in (7) and (8), the values of h, t1/2, k2 and qe were reflected in Table 2. The Eq. (8) is utilized to determine the initial rate of intraparticle diffusion [92]. In Table 3 kint (mg (g min−1/2)−1) indicates the rate constant in the intra-particle diffusion model. Data on the literature displayed that the slopes among qt and t1/2 were multi-faced. The qt chart with t1/2 is multilinear [91]. In the interaction with Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent material with methylene blue, the intraparticle diffusion model is compatible with the first stage of the adsorption process. Table 3 shows the values obtained for kint 1,2. The values of first plot are very high. So, these high values are not adequate for the first stage of adsorption process. kint2 is utilized for the intraparticle diffusion. Also, the second linear plot (mol.g.mol−1/2) shows compliance with kint2 [93]."

The activation energy of the MB adsorption mechanism on Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent was investigated.\nlnk2 ¼ lnA− EaR:T ð9Þ\nwhere; activation energy (Jmol−1), gas constant (8.314 Jmol−1 K−1), the rate constant of adsorption (g mmol−1 s−1), Arrhenius factor (g mmol−1 s−1), and solution temperature (K) are Ea, R, k2, A and K, respectively. The activation energy (Ea) was\nobtained from the Eq. (9) as 37.54 kJ mol−1 from the 1/T versus slope graph of ln k. Based on the energy value of the activation; it gives the idea that the working mechanism of adsorption is physical and chemical. While the low activation energy value (b40 kJ mol−1) is characteristic of the physical adsorption mechanism, it suggests that the greater activation energy (40–800 kJ mol−1) is carried out by the chemical adsorption mechanism [93–95]. As a result, the adsorption of methylene blue on the nano-adsorbent support particle indicates that it occurs as physical absorption. This can be clarified by the force of the Van der Waals, and by electrostatic attraction between the MB and the Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent. Other thermodynamic activation functions like enthalpy (ΔH°), Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), and entropy (ΔS°) were obtained by Eyring Eqs. (10) and (11) [95].\nln k2=Tð Þ ¼ ln kb=hð Þ þ ΔSR − ΔH RT\nð10Þ\nΔG ¼ ΔH−T ΔS ð11Þ\nwhere; the Boltzmann constant (1.3807 × 10−23 JK−1), enthalpy change, Gibbs free energy, entropy, Planck constant (6.6261 × 10−34 Js−1) and ideal gas constant are kb, ΔH°, ΔG°, ΔS°, h, and Rg, respectively. In Eq. (10), the positive value of ΔH° (40.05 kJ mol−1) obtained from the graphical slope of the ln k/T versus 1/T indicates that the working mechanism is sustaining through the endothermic process. The negative value of entropy in the working mechanism refers to an indication of the random decrease in the solid/solution interface during the adsorption interaction between the dye and the nano-adsorbent. Similar results and expressions for thermodynamic function values, such as entropy (ΔS°), enthalpy change (ΔH°), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) are reported in the literature [96–99]. As shown in Fig. 8, the adsorption functions and slopes with the help of Arrhenius Eq. (9) and Eyring Eq. (10) were obtained."

Experimental parameters were tested if compatible with the different three kinetic models, including the pseudo-first order, the pseudo-second order model, and intraparticle diffusion to determine the maximum removal efficiency and proper conditions. At the end of the experimental processes, a dye removal efficiency of 91.24% was reached at pH 10 and a reaction time of 90 min. It was also found the important function of O2 radicals in the removal of MB dye by Pt-Co@GO nano-adsorbent in adsorption processes performed by the ultrasonic method. Additionally, a reusability test was performed with a series of repeated experiments under optimum conditions of synthesized nano-adsorbent. The obtained data revealed that nano-adsorbent maintained its high efficiency at 54.15% as the end of 6 trials. In the adsorption process, term values of thermodynamic function such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG), activation energy (Ea), enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS) were investigated. According to the free Gibbs energy values obtained, the adsorption process is realized automatically. It was determined that the adsorption mechanism was more compatible with the particle diffusion model. Consequently, the prepared Pt-Co@GO nanoadsorbent is an extremely effective adsorbent material for the removing of dyes from industrial wastewater.\nAuthor contribution\nM.H.C. and F.S. organized all experiments and wrote the manuscript.
