      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Stimulated by the emerging of nano-diagnostic methods, self-monitored photo-thermal therapeutic agents (PTAs) based on multifunctional luminescent materials have been recently proposed as precise and non-invasive tools for combating cancer cells. During the photo-thermal therapy (PTT), the bio-imaging function is required to visualize the tumor growth and metastasis, while the intratumoral temperature variations also need to be real-time monitored via noncontact thermometry to prevent insufficient or excessive heating effects [1–4]. Owing to the superiority of low bio-toxicity, high penetration depth, non-blinking, minimized auto-luminescence and photo-damage, near-infrared (NIR) light driven luminescent nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely reported as thermal-sensing and imaging bio-probes in biomedical science [5–7]. Meanwhile, radiative process is inevitably accompanied by non-radiative heating (Scheme 1a), which offers the possibility of LNPs as potential PTAs [8–10]. These remarkable features endow LNPs with great potentiality as all-in-one optical nanoplatforms, yet the optimization of self-heating, bio-imaging and thermal sensing performances remains a challenging task that is crucial for self-monitored PTT in deep-tissues.\nAs a promising non-contact method, fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique of LNPs generally depend on phonon-assisted thermal coupled levels (TCLs) with appropriate energy gaps (200 ~ 2000 cm−1, Scheme 1b), which is mainly evaluated by thermal sensitivity and luminescent efficiency [11]. Among all TCLs, green-emitting 4S3/2/2H11/2 levels of Er3+ ion (ΔE ~ 800 cm−1) have been widely investigated as promising candidates for up-converting (UC) thermometry, however, their further bio-applications are severely hampered by their low penetration depth of visible light and moderate sensitivity (< 1.6% K−1) [3,12–14]. On one hand, the penetration depth could be greatly improved through shifting both excitation and emission wavelengths to the biological window (BW: 650–1350 nm) where has maximally reduced tissue scattering and absorption. On the other hand, the relative sensitivity and resolution could be improved by employing TCLs with large energy separation, such as Eu3+: 5D0/5D1 (~1750 cm−1) and Tm3+: 3F2,3/3H4 (~1700 cm−1), yet the decoupling effects may occur even at room temperature (RT) [15,16]. This technical obstacle could be well resolved using NIR emissions from 4F7/2/4F3/2 levels (ΔE ~ 2000 cm−1) of Nd3+ as FIR signals, in which the middle-ladder level 4F5/2 could effectively promote the thermal inter-relaxations between TCLs to avoid the decoupling effects [17–19]. Owing to large absorption cross section around 980 nm, Yb3+ ion is usually co-doped with Nd3+ to construct NIR-to-NIR LNPs for bio-imaging and biothermometry, where high thermal sensitivity and penetration depth would be possibly achieved [20,21]. For example, FIR nano-thermometry using Stokes NIR emissions from Yb3+ (2F5/2 → 2F7/2) and Nd3+ (4F3/2 → 4I11/2) has been recently reported for bio-applications [22,23]. Compared with multi-photon UC process, NIR anti-Stokes emissions\noriginated from one-step energy transfer (ET) process theoretically have less energy losses, yet large energy mismatch between Yb3+: 2F5/2 and Nd3+: 4F3/2 (~1000 cm−1) greatly limits the ET rates which could be filled by heat-favorable phonons [24]. Generally, the activity of phonon is greatly promoted to enhance non-radiative (NR) pathways at high temperature, resulting in the thermal quenching effect that is harmful for the practical applications of LNPs. However, the phonon-assisted ET process from Yb3+ to Nd3+ might be simultaneously promoted as increasing the temperature, in which the unfavorable thermal quenching could be possibly overcame in Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped systems [25,26]. Combining with remarkable photo-thermal effects of Nd3+ reported in previous works, the explorations of Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped LNPs with thermo-enhanced NIR-to-NIR anti-Stokes emissions are expected to bring significant progress in multimodal bio-imaging and ultra-sensitive thermometry for self-monitored PTT in deep-tissues [8,9].\nAs depicted in Scheme 1, more active phonons involved would simultaneously favor the self-heating, thermal sensing and thermal enhancement features of LNPs, which are mainly provided by the host lattices. As attractive alternatives, lanthanide phosphates with large phonon energy (~1000 cm−1) and porous hierarchical architectures display fascinating potentiality as host materials in biomedical applications [27,28]. In the present framework, urchin-like LaPO4: Yb3+/ Nd3+ nanothermometers with thermo-enhanced NIR-to-NIR anti-Stokes emissions were firstly developed via co-precipitation, and the inner mechanism of thermal enhancement effects was investigated. Irradiated by 980 nm laser, self-heating effects and NIR thermometry of Nd3+ based on 4F7/2-4F5/2-4F3/2 TCLs were evaluated, respectively. The penetration depth of samples was determined at varied tissue thickness, and their potentiality for self-monitored PTT in deep-tissues was also assessed in the ex vivo experiments."

      "text" : "Monodispersed Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped LaPO4 nanourchins were synthesized via a two-step co-precipitation process using spherical La (OH)CO3 as sacrificial templates. In the typical procedure, 0.5 mmol of Ln2O3 (Ln = La, Nd and Yb; 99.99%) was first dissolved in diluted HNO3 (A. R.) with continuously stirring and heating conditions, and then 100 mL of de-ionized (DI) water together with 24 g of urea were added to obtain the transparent solutions (pH = 4) followed by heating in water bath at 85 °C for 3 h. After washing the obtained precipitates with DI water and ethanol for three times, the white precursors were redispersed ultrasonically in a mixed solution containing 20 mL of DI water and 1 mmol of NH4H2PO4 (A. R.), which were maintained in water bath at 90 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the obtained samples were washed several times with DI water and ethanol and then dried at 70 °C for 24 h to get the urchin-like LNPs. Finally, the samples were further\nScheme 1.

The synthesis procedures of Er3+/Yb3+ or Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples were similar except the raw material Nd2O3 was replaced by Er2O3 or Tm2O3. In addition, the bulk sample was prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction, in which stoichiometric amounts of Ln2O3 and P2O5 were mixed and ground thoroughly with DI water and acetone followed by pre-sintered at 500 °C for 5 h and calcined at 1200 °C for 4 h to get the final samples. It is worth noting that the doping concentrations of Yb3+ and RE3+ (RE = Nd, Er and Tm) in LaPO4 nanoparticles were all fixed as 5% and 2% to avoid serious concentration quenching effect."

The morphologies and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) image of samples were measured by a Hitachi SU-8010 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a FEI TF-20 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of samples was determined by a Beishide 3H-2000PM2 apparatus, and the absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Temperature-dependent PL spectra and lifetimes were monitored by a FLS920 spectrophotometer equipped with an Oxford OptistatDN2 temperature controlling system and a 980 nm semiconductor laser coupled with a Rigol digital pulse generator, and the duration of stay at the measured temperature is set as 20 min in our experiments. The temperature images were real-time monitored by a Nippon InfReC R500 infrared thermal camera.\nFor the ex vivo experiments, 200 μL of PBS solution with LaPO4: Nd3+/Yb3+ nanourchins (1 mg/mL) was firstly injected into the pork tissues at around 3.5 ~ 4 mm depth. As tuning the 980 nm power density from 1.5 to 4.4 W/cm2, the temperature variations in surfaceand sub-tissue were real-time detected by infrared thermography and FIR method, which was repeated three times to guarantee the reliability of results."

      "text" : "The synthetic routes of the urchin-like LaPO4 nanoparticles could be mainly described as three steps: the co-precipitated preparation of spherical precursors, water bath treatment and subsequent calcination to get the final nanourchins, as schematically presented in Fig. 1a. The XRD patterns of Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped samples at each step were shown in Fig. 1b to identify their phase conversions, and no obvious peaks except two broad diffraction bands in the precursors may be identified as amorphous La(OH)CO3 [11]. Hexagonal-phased LaPO4·0.5H2O was obtained with high crystallinity after water bath treatment, which further transformed into hexagonal LaPO4 crystal without secondary phase after calcination. As displayed in Fig. S1a, the continuous thermal degradation (~9.8%) from RT to 400 °C with an obvious endothermic peak at 210 °C was detected in TG-DTA curves of LaPO4·0.5H2O, corresponding to the loss of physically adsorbed moisture, surfactant molecules and lattice water, which further proved the transition from hydrous products to hexagonal LaPO4 during the annealing process [27]. FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out to better characterize the composition of as-prepared products at each step (Fig. S1b), in which the absorption peaks at 1629 and 3429 cm−1 in all samples were attributed to the bending and stretching vibrational modes of water molecules. The typical absorptions of CO32− (690, 736 and 844 cm−1) and O-C-O (1417 and 1489 cm−1) of precursor samples strongly demonstrate the existence of alkaline carbonate groups. After reacting\nwith PO43−, several absorption bands from tetrahedral PO43− groups at 542, 617 and 1055 cm−1 emerged with nearly vanished carbonate groups, revealing the successful transition from precursors to phosphates. After the annealing process, the original band around 1000 cm−1 splits into two sharp peaks at 952 and 1091 cm−1 due to the formation of monazite with lower symmetry, which were assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching mode PO43−. The rapid decrease in the characteristic vibrations of O–H group further confirmed the dehydration of phosphate hydrates, while the strongest absorptions at 1091 cm−1 determined the phonon energy of hexagonal LaPO4 [28].\nAs representatives, SEM and TEM images of Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped samples at each stage were presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 to explore their morphological evolution, and the microstructure was hardly influenced by the dopants. In the initial stage, a bunch of monodispersed nanospheres with homogeneous size of about 175 nm were clearly observed in Fig. 1c, which acted as the templates for the subsequent reactions. As further reacting with PO43− in water bath, urchin-like nanoparticles were formed without changing the original particle size and dispersibility, yet numerous nanothorns grew on the surface of nanospheres (Fig. S2). After the annealing at 600 °C, the urchin-like nanostructure was well preserved with distorted nanothorns and shrunken size due to the dehydration and decomposition of residual organics, as shown in Fig. 1d. Single-particle TEM further revealed its hierarchical architecture with several internal holes (Fig. 1e), in which the average sizes of inner sphere and surface-attached thorn are around 150 and 28 nm, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 1f-g, the concentric diffraction ring patterns indexed as the (1 2 0), (−1 1 2), (−3 1 1) and (3 2 0) planes of LaPO4 in SAED image disclosed the polycrystalline nature of products, meanwhile the clear lattice fringe with d-spacing of 0.331 nm in HR-TEM image was corresponded to the (2 0 0) crystal face of LaPO4. The formation of urchin-like LaPO4 nanoparticles could be explained by the Kirkendall effects. When PO43- ions are introduced to precursor solutions, the quick reaction between free La3+ ions located at the surface of nanospheres and PO43− occurs and forms the LaPO4 shells of numerous nanothorns aggregated on the surface of La (OH)CO3, which avoids the direct contact between inner La3+ and PO43−. As the reaction proceeds, the diffusion of La3+ and PO43− through the shells leads to the gradual conversion from precursors to the urchin-like LaPO4, in which several internal holes could possibly form due to the unbalanced inter-diffusion process [27,28]. The N2 absorption-desorption measurements (Fig. S3) further confirmed the mesoporous structure of samples with the average pore size of 7.15 nm, and the BET surface area was greatly increased from precursor nanospheres (18.7 m2/g) to LaPO4 nanourchins (50.9 m2/g), which is beneficial to the absorptivity of excitation energy via multiple reflections and photo-thermal effects. Thus, the large surface area and several pore spaces endow hierarchical LaPO4 nanourchins with great potentiality in biomedical science [29]."

      "text" : "Fig. 2a displayed the absorption spectra of Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped LaPO4·0.5H2O and LaPO4 nanourchins within the BW region, in which four absorption bands at 744, 800, 869 and 975 nm in two samples were ascribed to the 4I9/2 → 4F3/2, 4F5/2, 4F7/2 (Nd3+) and 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) transitions, respectively. After the calcination, several sharped sub-peaks were clearly detected due to the modification of crystal field effects around Nd3+ ions. Notably, the partial overlap between 4I9/2 → 4F3/2 (Nd3+) and the edge of 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 (Yb3+) broad absorption implies the existence of energy transfer (ET) from Yb3+ to Nd3+. Therefore, PL spectra of Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped samples were recorded within far-red and NIR area under 980 nm excitation (Fig. 2b), in which emission bands at 749, 805 and 863 nm from 4F7/2, 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transitions of Nd3+ were clearly detected after the annealing treatment. As depicted in Fig. 2c, two possible phonon-assisted ET pathways from Yb3+ to Nd3+ were responsible for the NIR-to-NIR anti-\nStokes emissions of Nd3+ under 980 nm excitation: one is the onephoton ET process [2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I9/2 (Nd3+)→ 4F3/2 (Nd3+) + 2F7/ 2 (Yb3+)], where energy mismatch of about 1000 cm−1 between 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and 4F3/2 (Nd3+) should be filled by active lattice phonons; the other is two successive ET [ET-1: 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I9/2 (Nd3+) → 4I15/2 (Nd3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+); ET-2: 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I15/2 (Nd3+) → 2H11/2 (Nd3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+)] and the subsequent NR processes, where the most of absorbed energy is transferred to heat via phonon vibrations [24]. Power-dependent 805 nm emission intensity was plotted at RT in Fig. S4 to qualitatively analyze above mechanisms, and the slope (S) of the fitting line represents the involved photons in the radiative process [14]. Under 980 nm excitation with low power density, the slope of 1.1 revealed the dominant role of one-photon process, while the twophoton process became more efficient (S = 1.36) as increasing the power density close to 10 W/cm2.\nDue to the large energy mismatch, Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped phosphors usually have lower luminescent efficiency than those of UC systems, and the excitation energy is mainly converted to internal heat via phonon-assisted NR routes, which has great potential use in PTT [8–10,19]. Thus, the photo-thermal effects of samples with different activators (Er3+, Tm3+ or Nd3+) and particle sizes (bulk material or nanoparticle) were monitored using the infrared thermal camera under 980 nm excitation (P = 3.5 W/cm2). As plotted in Fig. 2d, the temperature raised rapidly from ambient temperature (~300 K) to the balance points for all samples, and LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanourchins achieved higher temperature (~321 K) with faster rate than that of Yb3+/Tm3+ (~316 K) or Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped samples (~309 K), which is accordance with their degree of energy mismatch with 2F5/2 (Yb3+). Meanwhile, rich closely-spaced intermediate levels existed in\nNd3+ ion would also contributes the self-heating effects via more NR channels [9]. It was observed that LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanoparticles exhibited much better photo-thermal effects than that of bulk samples (~304 K) due to the high specific surface area of the present hierarchical architecture."

      "text" : "As mentioned above, lattice phonon plays a decisive role in NIR-toNIR anti-Stokes emissions of Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped systems, which could be greatly affected by the surrounding temperature. Therefore, the effects of phonon-assisted ET process on NIR emissions of LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanourchins were validated via temperature-dependent PL spectral mapping under 980 nm excitation (P = 0.5 W/cm2, Fig. 3a). Remarkably, the unique phenomenon of thermo-boosted Nd3+ emission intensity was found via elevating temperature from 280 to 490 K. As visualized in Fig. 3b, the pattern “Nd” placed by samples could not be discerned with the excitation of 980 nm laser at RT, while it gradually appeared as increasing the temperature due to the enhanced farred emissions from the band edge of 4F7/2 → 4I9/2 transition. Phononassisted ET process from Yb3+ to Nd3+ is responsible for such thermal enhancement, and the decay curves of Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition in Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped and Yb3+ solely-doped samples were measured in Fig. S5 to calculate the ET efficiency (ηETE = 1 − τx/τo) [30]. Based on the fitted lifetimes, the calculated ηETE rapidly increased from about 10% to 19% with rising temperature from 280 to 490 K, suggesting that active lattice phonon offers more energy at high temperature to promote Nd3+ anti-Stokes emissions (Fig. 3c). Meanwhile, the smaller slope of fitting line in power-dependent emission plot (Fig. S4) at 490 K\n(S = 1.01) than that at RT (S = 1.10) further confirmed that the phonon-assisted one-photon ET process becomes more efficient as temperature rise. Due to the large phonon energy of LaPO4 (~1100 cm−1), only one phonon is needed to fill the energy mismatch between Nd3+ and Yb3+, which greatly benefits the thermal enhancement effects. Strikingly, the enhancement factors (I490K/I280K) of 4F7/2, 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 transitions were calculated to be approximately 1052, 43 and 9-fold, respectively (Fig. S6). Besides the phonon-assisted ET, thermal coupling effects from low-lying levels 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 also contribute to the population of upper level 4F7/2, thus the enhancing factors follow the order of the energy state position [15]. As summarized in Table S1, such a great thermal enhancement of antiStokes emission within BW region over 1000 times has been rarely reported. Additionally, the temperature-recycle tests over three heating process (Fig. 3d) demonstrated the excellent repeatability of thermal enhancement behavior in LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanourchins, evidencing the potentiality of the present samples in diverse emerging applications, especially in thermal sensing, multimodal bio-imaging and anti-counterfeiting field [31,32]."

      "text" : "According to the position of absorption peaks (Fig. 2a), the energy\ngaps of ladder-like 4F7/2/4F5/2 (TCL-1), 4F5/2/4F3/2 (TCL-2) and 4F7/ 2/4F3/2 (TCL-3) of Nd3+ were determined to be around 941, 992 and 1933 cm−1, which are perfectly suitable for TCLs-based FIR thermometry integrated with thermo-enhanced optical signals. Therefore, thermal evolution PL spectra of LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ were normalized at 805 nm (4F5/2 → 4I9/2) in Fig. 4a, where the spectral intensity of 4F3/2, 4F7/2 → 4I9/2 transitions was both magnified three times for better comparison. The drastic variations of relative intensity from TCL-1, 2, 3 were observed as elevating temperature from 280 to 490 K, and the FIR value between three quasi-thermal balanced TCLs could be expressed as: [15]\n= = ⎛ ⎝ − ⎞ ⎠ = ⎛ ⎝ − ⎞ ⎠ FIR I I ω A g ω A g E KT B E KT exp Δ exp Δ2 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 (1)\nwhere I, ω, A, g and K denote the emission intensity, angular frequency, spontaneous emission rate, degeneracy and Boltzmann’s constant; The energy gap between TCLs is symbolized by ΔE and ω2A2g2 /ω1A1g1 represents the coefficient B. As shown in Fig. S7, ΔE was calculated to be 938, 935 and 1897 cm−1 for TCL-1, 2, 3 with small errors δ (|ΔE - Em|/Em) of about 1.2%, 5.7% and 1.8%, respectively. For practical applications, absolute sensitivity (Sa) and relative sensitivity (Sr) have been widely employed to quantitatively assess the temperature sensing behavior of thermometers, which could be mathematically defined as:\n[15]\n= =S dFIR dT FIR E KT Δ a 2 (2)\n= × =S dFIR FIR dT E KT Δ r 2 (3)\nAccording to above expressions, Sr (unit: %K−1) allows the direct comparison between different types of sensors which is independent of thermal parameters related with B, yet sensors based on the same\nmethod (e. g. TCLs-based sensors) could be well compared using Sa (unit: K−1) since it takes FIR values into consideration [33]. As plotted in Fig. 4b and c, the calculated Sa values of TCL-1, 2, 3 gradually increased and reached to the maximums about 0.0011, 0.1853 and 0.0736 K−1 at 490 K, while the optimal Sr values were found to be 1.73%, 1.72% and 3.51% K−1 at the starting point 280 K, respectively. Moreover, nearly identical FIR values based on TCL-1, 2, 3 were recorded over three heating cycles from 280 K to 490 K (Fig. S8), suggesting the outstanding repeatability and photochemical stability of the present nanoparticles. As another crucial parameter for thermometers, temperature resolution δT defines the smallest temperature variation resolvable by sensors in a given optical setup, which strongly depends on Sr value and standard deviation of FIR value: δT = δFIR/(FIR*Sr) [18,33]. Impressively, the optimal δT of TCL-1, 2, 3 was calculated to be about 0.38, 0.5 and 0.02 K, which are in perfect accordance with Sr value.\nIn order to provide comprehensive comparison with other reported FIR thermometers, the thermal-sensing characters of different materials including sensitivity and operating spectral range were summarized in Tables S2 and S3. For TCL-based sensors, the present samples operating in BW area possessed much higher Sa values than other Ln3+-based sensors (Ln = Gd, Er, Tm, Dy, Ho, Nd), as intuitionally plotted in Fig. 4d [33–39]. Remarkably, Sa based on TCL-2 (~0.1853 K−1) is nearly 10 times higher than the reported highest value (~0.023 K−1) of the most developed Er3+-based sensors [37]. On the other hand, the Sr\nvalue based on TCL-3 (~3.51% K−1) is also higher than most of TCLsbased phosphors owning to its bigger energy gap (~1897 cm−1), for example, the reported Sr based on 4S3/2/2H11/2 TCLs of Er3+ (~800 cm−1) is usually less than 1.6% K−1 [40]. Meanwhile, the obtained Sr values are also superior and comparable with other types of FIR thermometers, such as QDs (~2.5% K−1) and MOFs (~3.53% K−1) [41–43]. In additions, the present samples offer higher thermal resolution (< 0.5 K, optimal value ~0.02 K) in comparison with previous studies, such as NaYF4: Yb3+/Er3+ (~1 K), LiLuF4: Nd3+ (~0.6 K), EuTb(btfa)3(H2O)2 (~0.5 K) and Ag/Ag2S (~0.2 K) [1,8,44,45]. Considering the above remarkable thermal enhancement feature, the designed LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanothermometers exhibit ultra-high thermal sensitivity and resolution in BW area, which have great promise in subcutaneous imaging and sensing applications."

Unlike 2H11/2/4S3/2 TCLs, the FIR values based on NIR emissions were barely fluctuated with the increase of tissue depth due to their minimum absorptions by tissues, revealing the great superiority of NIR-to-NIR anti-Stokes emissions in deep-tissue bio-imaging and FIR thermometry over the visible lights.\nIn order to further testify the feasibility of deep-tissue thermometry with sub-degree resolution (< 1 K), ex vivo experiments were designed in light of the self-monitored photo-thermal process, in which LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanoparticles were injected into pork tissues at around 3.5 ~ 4 mm depth. Irradiating by 980 nm laser, the injected samples first generate massive heats via NR routes used for PTT, and the changes of sub-tissue temperature are real-time probed by FIR technique based on three TCLs of Nd3+, as schematically depicted in Fig. 5b. As a contrast, a thermal camera is employed to record the 2D thermal images of tissue surface. As plotted in Fig. 5c, no obvious heating effects in the pork tissues alone (control group) were found under 980 nm laser irradiation, whereas the almost linear growth of surface and sub-tissue temperature from 298 to 308 K and 298 to 328 K was clearly found as adjusting the power density from 1.5 to 4.4 W/cm2, respectively. Such a significant temperature difference between surface and sub-tissues is attributed to heat diffusion inside tissues and heat loss from tissue surface to air [4,33]. Notably, the average values of experimental resolution δT of TCL-1, 2, 3 were determined to be about 0.65, 0.54 and 0.4 K, which well meets the requirements of δT < 1 K during in vivo PTT [47]. Thus, LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanourchins could simultaneously offer intense NIR-to-NIR signals, efficient light-to-heat conversions and accurate temperature feedback with sub-degree resolutions in deeptissues, which could minimally prevent the collateral damages of normal tissues during PTT."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "In summary, urchin-like LaPO4: Yb3+/Nd3+ nanothermometers working in BW area were rationally designed with ultra-high thermal sensitivity (Sa-max ~ 0.1853 K−1, Sr-max ~ 3.51% K−1), resolution (δTmin ~ 0.02 K) and repeatability using ladder-like 4F7/2-4F5/2-4F3/2 of Nd3+ as TCLs. Meanwhile, thermally enhanced NIR-to-NIR anti-Stokes emissions with maximum factor of 1052-fold (4F7/2 → 4I9/2) were detected with good reversibility, resulting from the increased phononassisted ET efficiency from Yb3+ to Nd3+. Irradiated by 980 nm laser, NIR emissions were still detectable even at the tissue depth of 7.5 nm with nearly unchanged FIR values. Integrated with the self-heating effects, urchin-like nanoparticles real-time monitored the temperature increments induced by itself with sub-degree resolution in deep-tissues under single 980 nm excitation. These combined features make the present heater-thermometer nanoplatforms with thermo-boosted NIRto-NIR signals promising candidates towards minimally invasive PTT with real-time NIR imaging and thermal control.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
