      "text" : "The production of hydrogen from water photolysis is one of\nthe key solutions for the development of green and sustain-\nable energy supplies and it is under intense investigation [1,2].\nIndeed, since an earlier report that semiconductors can\nperformwater photolysis, a huge profusion studies have been\ninvestigated to obtain more active photocatalysts that can\noperate under visible light with higher quantum yields.\nHowever, most of the cases reported so far involve semi-\nconductor (TiO2, ZnO, tantalum oxides, and N-doped carbons, for example) loading with transition metal nanoparticles (Au,\nPt, Ag, and Cu, in particular) [3e15]. Although significant\nachievements have been reported for the production of mi-\ncromoles, and in some casesmillimoles, of hydrogen per hour,\nmost only operate efficiently in the presence of a sacrificial\ndonor (usually alcohols) to overcome the kinetic barrier of the\noxidation. The oxidation of the sacrificial agents usually\ncontributes to the generation of the desired product and,\nhence, it does not accurately quantify the reduction products\n(photo-reforming instead of water splitting) [16,17]. The size\nand shape of the semiconductors also plays an important role\nin the photocatalytic performance [18,19]. In(OH)3 is an important n-type wide-gap semiconductor material with a\ndirect band gap of 5.15 eV, and it is a promising material for\nphoto-applications. In particular, it has great potential in\nphotocatalysis, such as H2 evolution from water splitting, due to the strong redox ability of the conduction band (CB) elec-\ntrons ( 0.93 V vs. NHE) and the valence band (VB) holes (4.24 V vs. NHE) [20]. Bare In(OH)3 of various shapes, such as nanosheets, spheres, nanorods, and nanocubes, can usually be\nprepared via hydrothermal routes, albeit at relative high\ntemperatures [21e31].\nTherefore, In(OH)3may constitute an adequatematerial for the investigation of the influence of nano-structure shapes on\ntheir photocatalytic properties. In this respect, it was reported\nthat nearly monodisperse single-crystalline In(OH)3 nanocubes and other polyhedra display H2 evolution from methanol photo-reforming, which is higher than P25-titania, albeit\nthe shapeeproperty relationship still needs to be fully ach-\nieved [32]. Moreover, most of the contributions reported so far\nare related to the photocatalytic properties of doped In2O3 (Table S2) [20,33e43]. Themain goal of this contributionwas to\ndetermine the nano-object shape effect on the photocatalytic\nproperties of the water splitting. For this purpose, we devel-\noped a very simple and reliable ionothermal method for the\ngeneration of In(OH)3 nano-plates and nanotubes and we investigated their photocatalytic properties (Fig. 1). Herein, we\nreport that the nano-object morphology has a profound effect\non the H2 generation from methanol reforming, attaining 372 mmolg 1h 1."

Indium chloride (InCl3) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz\nVarian spectrometer at ambient probe temperature and\nreferenced to an internal TMS. The FTIR analysis of the ionic\nadduct BMIOMe.InCl4 was performed in a Bruker Alpha-P spectrometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry\n(ESI-MS) was carried out in a Waters micromass Q-Tof\nmicroTM instrument using standard operating conditions,\nsuch as 3.85 kV capillary voltage and 25V cone voltage (positive\nmode), or 3.87 kV capillary voltage and 35 V cone voltage\n(negative mode) and 80 C de-solvation gas temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) insights were studied\nusing Q2000 TA Instruments equipment with a heating rate of 10 C min 1. TGA was performed in a Q50 TA TGA operating under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. Transmission electron mi-\ncroscopy (TEM) micrographs were obtained using a JEOL\nJEM1200 EXII operating at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and\na JEOL JEM2010 operating at 200 kV (CMM/UFRGS). XRD pat-\nterns were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (D-5000 S-\nBruker-AXS, 40 kV, 25 mA, CuKa radiations). X-ray photoelec-\ntron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using\na Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD instrument. The chamber pressure during the measurements was 5 10 9 Torr. Wide energy range survey scans were collected at pass energy of 80 eV in\nhybrid slot lensmode and a step size of 0.5 eV, for 20min. High-\nresolution data on the In 3d, C 1s, N 1s and O 1s photoelectron\npeaks was collected at a pass energy of 20 eV over energy\nranges suitable for each peak, and collection times of 5 min,\nstep sizes of 0.1 eV. The charge neutraliser filament was used\nto prevent the sample charging over the irradiated area. The X-\nray sourcewas amonochromated Al Ka emission, run at 10mA\nand 12 kV (120 W). The energy range for each ‘pass energy’\n(resolution) was calibrated using the Kratos Cu 2p3/2, Ag 3d5/2 and Au 4f7/2 three-point calibration method. The transmission function was calibrated using a clean gold sample method for\nall lensmodes and the Kratos transmission generator software\nwithin Vision II. The high-resolution datawas charge corrected\nto the reference C 1s signal at 284.5 eV. Apparent quantum\nefficiency was calculated as reported earlier [46] employing a\nquartz water filter (5 cm) to remove infrared radiation."

In\nparticular, the structural directionality imposed by the IL is\napparently more effective in the generation of structured\nnanomaterials if themetal oxide precursor is the IL anion [46].\nThe simple thermal treatment of BMIOMe$InCl4 [44] with aqueous NaOH affords In(OH)3 with different shapes [nanoplates (NPLs) and nanotubes (NTs)] depending upon the re-\naction temperature (Table 3). At 10 C, NPLs with an average diameter of 25.2 ± 7 nm were obtained. Whereas at 30 C, NTs that were 26.6 ± 6 nm in length and 10 ± 3 nm in width were\nobserved. As the temperature increased, small NTs with\nlengths of 25.9 ± 6 nm and 6 ± 2 nm in width at 50 C and large NTs with 49.2 ± 18 nm length and 15 ± 5 nm in width at 80 C were obtained (Fig. 2).\nIt is important to note that High resolution transmission\nelectron microscopy images (Fig. 2b) of the NPLs prepared at\n10 C showed a lattice fringe spacing of around 0.26 nm that can be indexed to the (101) planes of In(OH)3 [48]. Whereas, NTs prepared at 30 C (Fig. 2d) demonstrated that these tubes consist of an outer layer of In(OH)3 having a lattice fringe spacing of around 0.26 nmfilledwith In2O3with a lattice fringe spacing of 0.30 nm, which can be the lattice spacing of body-\ncentred-cubic (bcc) In2O3 [49]. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-prepared nano-objects at different\ntemperatures are presented in Fig. S4. All diffraction peaks\ncan be assigned to the bcc In(OH)3 with the Im-3 space group, which is in accordance with the standard (JCPDS No. 76-1446).\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis (Fig. S5) at around\n300 C shows the loss of organic materials (most probably residual IL), yielding 13.6% organic content for the nano-plates\n(NPls) prepared at 10 C and 14.7, 12.2, and 14.0% for NTs prepared at 30, 50, and 80 C, respectively.

An oxide\nlattice component was observed at 530.8 eV [55,56]. A second\ncomponent at 531.6 eV was assigned to the presence of hy-\ndroxide as well as oxygen vacancies in the structure [53,56].\nThe component at the higher binding energy was related to\nadsorbed water and organic compounds [53,55].\nThe XPS results prove that the synthesis temperature af-\nfects the chemical environment of both O and In surface\natoms. It is noteworthy that while the surface of the sample\nprepared at 10 C consists of only In(OH)3, the formation of relevant amounts of superficial oxide was clearly observed for\nthe other three samples. Furthermore, with a higher synthesis\ntemperature, the contribution of the oxide component at both\nO 1s and In 3d photoemission regions is higher, whereas the\nhydroxide components are lower. It is clear from Table 2 that\nthe concentration of In(OH)3 decreases with augmentation of the temperature (from 100% at 10 C to 5.1% at 80 C). Moreover, there is a clear decrease in the oxygen vacancies and\nhydroxides with the increase in the reaction temperature\n(from 92.5% at 10 C to 13.6% at 80 C) (see supporting information Table S1).\nThe optical measurements were evaluated by diffuse\nreflectance spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. In(OH)3/In2O3 prepared at 30 C and 80 C shows only one electronic transition around 240 nm (5.1 eV); however, the samples prepared\nat 10 C and 50 C show two electronic transitions due to the electron oscillation perpendicular and along the nano-object\naxis [57]. The distinct electronic transitions for samples pre-\npared at 10 C and 50 C can be related to the morphology transition and, thus, their non-stoichiometry surface.

A similar results behaviour was observed for\nsamples prepared at 30 C and 80 C as that previously observed in UVeVis measurements; however, the samples\nprepared at 10 C and 50 C displayed a different behaviour. The sample prepared at 10 C shows the highest PL intensity, whereas the samples prepared at 50 C show the lowest PL intensity. In fact, the morphology/defects induced during the\nsyntheses of the sample prepared at 50 C led to an efficient suppression of the electronehole pair recombination process.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy was utilized to\nprobe the structural characteristics of the as-prepared\nIn(OH)3/In2O3, as shown in Fig. S8. Two intense bands at 3225 and 3111 cm 1 were observed, which are attributed to the OH stretching modes of In(OH)3. The bands at 1150, 1060, and 780 cm 1 are assigned to OH deformation modes. Furthermore, the presence of an intense peak at 492 cm 1 probably\ncorresponds to IneO [59]. From the TG/DSA profile, twoweight\nlosses can be observed at about 30e310 C and 310e500 C (Fig. S5). The weight loss between room temperature and\n~310 C can be attributed to the removal of free and bound water/OH from the surface of the In(OH)3 nano-objects [26], whereas the materials that endothermically lose their weight\nprepared at 30 C after its calcination at 200 C (water/methano\nfrom 310 to 500 C can be attributed to the chemical dehydration of In2O3 [60]."

Note that the obtained\napparent quantum yield (Table 4, entry 14) is among highest\nreported so far (compare with entries 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, Table 4.\nNote that it was reported that photocatalytic activity is\nrelated with the length size and width for nanorodes, which\nincreases with the increases with the length and width of\nnanorodes that prolongs the lifetime of photoexcited charge\ncarriers in semiconductors [63,64]. In our case, the augmen-\ntation on the photocatalytic activity was observed with the\ndecrease of the length and width of nano-object (Table 3, en-\ntries 1-4).\nThe interaction of ILs and semiconductors may modulate\nthe band gap of the semiconductors [65,66] and may provide\nthe driving force towards photocatalytic redox processes by\nthe creation of a solid semiconductoreliquid junction reduced\nby improving the charge separation and tuning the electron/\nhole ratio. Interestingly, the presence of an IL layer in these\nIn(OH)3/In2O3 nanomaterials (Observed by TGA, XPS analysis, and 13C CP-MAS NMR) displays the typical signals of the imi-\ndazolium cation in hybrid materials [67,68] also induces the\nphoto-catalytic generation of H2 (Fig. 5). It is believed that the presence of an IL may act as an electron carrier, causing\nelectron transfer from the conduction band [69]. When the\nhighly active In(OH)3/In2O3 catalyst prepared at 30 C was calcinated at 200 C for 1 h to remove some extent of the IL (having only 1.5% IL, Fig. S11) and tested under our standard\nconditions, a low amount of H2 was produced (Fig. 5b). In fact, the residual amount of the IL was larger in the samples pre-\npared at 30 C that in others prepared at 10, 50, 80, and 200 C. This is another indication of the role played by the IL on the\nsurface properties of the semiconductors, as predicted by\ntheoretical calculations [70].\nMoreover, the residual IL may facilitate the contact of the\nwater/alcohol with the surface semiconductor, akin to that\nobserved for related hybrid IL-containing materials [46].\nMechanistically, methanol plays a critical role as a sacrificing\nagent. It would react with the formed hydroxyl free radical (OH ), produced from the reaction of hþ with H2O at the surface of In(OH)3/In2O3 nanomaterials, resulted in\nCH2OH reactive intermediate [73,74]. Besides, hydroxyl group of CH3OH also captures photogenerated holes (h þ) to give\nCH2OH. This oxidation product ( CH2OH) is an electron donor that injects electrons to the conduction band to in-\ncrease the potential for the evolution of H2. It is important to note that a small extent of CO, CH4 and CO2 (2e5%) were also observed in all cases, which are the photoreformed products\nof CH3OH. The recyclability of the catalyst (Fig. 6) was also investigated, which showed no decrease in the catalytic ac-\ntivity under our standard conditions, yielding a H2 productivity of 5.76 mmol/g (57.6 mmol) for indium nano-objects\nafter 32 h of irradiation."

      "heading" : "Conclusions",
      "text" : "The simple basic thermal hydrolysis of 1-(2-methoxy-ethyl)-3-\nmethyl imidazolium tetrachloro-indate (BMIOMe$InCl4) IL generated In(OH)3/In2O3 nano-objects with different shapes (plates and tubes) depending on the reaction temperature. The\nratio of In(OH)3 decreased with the augmentation of the temperature (from 100% at 10 C to 5.1% at 80 C). At 10 C, In(OH)3 nanoplates were formed exclusively. With the increase in reaction temperature, In2O3 started to form and the shape gradually changed to small nanotubes and to larger\nnanotubes. The thermal treatment at 200 C lead to In2O3. The increase in temperature also leads to the gradual remove of\nresidual IL. It appears that the interaction of the residual IL\nand indium nano-objects provides the driving force towards\nphotocatalytic redox processes by the creation of a solid\nsemiconductoreliquid junction reduced via the charge sepa-\nration and tuning of the electron/hole ratio, hence enhancing\nthe catalytic activity. The productivity obtained by the relatively small In(OH)3/In2O3 (1:1) with a rate of 3.72 mmol h 1 and 5.76 mmol/g after 32 h is larger than those obtained with bare\nIn-based semiconductors reported so far. It is also clear that\nthere is no direct correlation between the nano-object surface\narea and photocatalytic performance, but there is a relation-\nship between the concentration of indium hydroxide on the\nsurface and the amount of residual IL. It also appears that the\npresence of the In2O3 phase is also required for the photocatalytic performance of the In(OH)3 nano-objects. Indeed,\nboth bare indium hydroxide and indium oxide showed mar-\nginal catalytic activity. Finally, not only the shape of the nano-\nobjects plays an important role on the photo-reforming cata-\nlytic properties, but the presence of residual IL may also play\nan important role as a surface semiconductor modifier."
