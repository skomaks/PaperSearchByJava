      "text" : "Micro- or nano-sized materials with hollow and porous structures are large in surface-to-mass ratio, and high in loading capacity as well as surface exposure. With these characteristics, they could be used as catalysts and adsorbents [1]. It was demonstrated that for photocatalytic interactions, materials of multi-shell structures are superior to those of conventional simple structures [2,3]. The phenomenon is attributed to the higher light absorption ability of the former as a result of multi-scattering and multi-reflection within the hollow and porous structures, as well as to the shortened charge-carrier-diffusion distances in the thin-shell topologies. Binary-oxide photocatalysts of multi-shell and hollow structures have been reported, such as multi-shell ZnO hollow microspheres [4], shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow microspheres [5], and triple-shell CeO2 hollow microspheres [6]. With the advances of synthetic approaches, considerable efforts have been devoted to the construction of hollow architectures, not only of simple but also of complex compositions. For example, there are reports on the synthesis of multi-shell Au/CeO2, Au/Cu2O and TiO2/Fe2TiO5 hollow spheres [7–9]. It was reported that metal sulfides with multi-shell and hollow micro- or nano-structures are better in photocatalytic performance compared with their metal-oxide counterparts [10]. Box-in-box NiS, double-shell NiCo2S4 hollow spheres as well as multi-shell Cu2S were\nfabricated by anionic exchange or hard-template method [11,12]. With suitable band-gap width (2.4 eV) and band-edge position, CdS is promising in visible-light-driven photocatalysis in areas such as pollutant degradation [13], hydrogen evolution [14] and organic synthesis [15,16]. Unfortunately, bulk CdS has major drawbacks. First, the use of visible light is not optimized and there is ready recombination of electron-hole pairs [17–19]. Another fatal drawback is the selfoxidation of S2− and the release of Cd2+ under the influence of photogenerated holes, and such instability restricts practical applications [20]. Therefore, great efforts have been made to fabricate CdS with exquisite nanostructures or constructed type-II heterostructures to enhance photocatalytic performance as well as catalyst stability [19,21]. Exploiting the merits of heterojunction and hierarchical structure, Lou et al. synthesized multi-shell hollow ZnS/CdS cages via ion exchange using ZIF-8 as template [22]. In addition, a way to prevent photo-corrosion of chalcogenides is to fabricate a core-shell structure, where the protective shell passivates the surface trap states of core materials [20]. For example, carbon-based materials were used to protect CdS from photo-corrosion [23]. Among the carbon-based materials, polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted much attention because of its abundance, thermal and chemical stability as well as visible-light responsiveness [24,25]. Coupling with C3N4 to form core-shell structure can not only enhance the photostablity but also the photocatalytic\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.04.006 Received 25 January 2019; Received in revised form 31 March 2019; Accepted 4 April 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

There are reports on carbon nitride heterocomposites as well as on the modification of carbon nitride materials with simple architectures using supramolecular assembly methods [27–29]. Nevertheless, architectural g-C3N4 of diverse morphology such as helix, multi-shell microspheres and porous frameworks were rarely synthesized using direct approaches, but commonly by hard- or softtemplating methods [30,31]. To our awareness, it is a big challenge to directly couple metal sulfides with C3N4 for the generation of composites with multi-shell architectures.\nHerein, we report the facile fabrication of double-shell CdS@C3N4 octahedron (denoted herein as 2-CSCN) by an in situ supramolecular self-assembly approach. We evaluated the photocatalytic performance of 2-CSCN for hydrogen production in water splitting as well as selective oxidation of saturated CeH bonds under visible light illumination. It was observed that 2-CSCN displays photocatalytic activity and stability superior to CdS and other CdS-C3N4 catalysts reported to date."

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to acquire the Cd 3d, S 2p, N 1s and C 1s spectra of samples with the binding energies (BE) calibrated against the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) of adventitious carbon, using Mg-Kα (hν=1253.6 eV) as excitation source (XPS, SSX-100, Mg-Kα). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were recorded over a Cary-100 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as background reference. The specific surface area of samples was studied by N2 adsorption and desorption method at 77 K using a NOVA 1000e instrument (Quantachrome Instruments, USA), adopting the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller formula for calculation. The FTIR spectra were recorded with an IR Affinity-1 FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Briefly, about 5.0mg of each sample was added to 100mg of KBr for pulverizing.

      "heading" : "3. Results and discussion",
      "text" : "The overall scheme of our strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the hydrothermal treatment process, partial decomposition of octahedral Cd3(C3N3S3)2 (denoted herein as CdTMT) happens and there is the release of CdS, cyanuric acid (CA), and sulfur (Fig. 1A) [33]. At the same time, there is hydrogen bonding between melamine and the released CA, resulting in the generation of CAM [34–39]. Simultaneously, the CdS crystal nuclei formed in hydrothermal treatment are surrounded by CAM entities to form complexes (denoted as CCAM). The resulted CCAM adsorbed on the surface of CdTMT composes a core-shell structure, establishing the polyhedron shape. The generation of 2-CSCN and 1-CSCN was achieved after polycondensation under calcination. As shown in Fig. 1B and b, the CdTMT octahedron precursor with smooth surface and 800–1000 nm in diameters were prepared according to our previous work [32]. After the first hydrothermal treatment but without calcination (Step-I), there is the formation of core-shell structure with rough surface as well as retention of octahedral morphology (Fig. 1C and c). In addition, there is a large cavity between the irregular solid core and octahedral shell. The presence of CdS, CA, melamine as well as CdTMT in Step-I was confirmed by XRD and FT-IR analysis (Fig. S1, Supporting information, SI). It should be noted that the decomposition rate of CdTMT and formation rate of CCAM can be controlled by regulating the reaction conditions. At optimized reaction time and temperature, there is facile supramolecular assembly of exogenous melamine with the in situ generated CA through hydrogen bonding on the surface of the remaining CdTMT, which results in a decrease of\nmelamine diffusion rate toward the inner core. When the supply rate of melamine is low, CdTMT@CCAM splits into inner and outer layers, forming a sort of irregular yolk-shell structure. The interior core is also irregular in shape. Therefore, we can obtain single-shell CdS-C3N4 hollow octahedron (1-CSCN) by prolonging the time of hydrothermal I (Fig. 1D and E). When the core-shell structure (Step-I) has undergone the second (Step-II) and third hydrothermal treatment (Step-III), there is the obvious appearance of a shell with a loose and hollow internal core, and finally double-shell octahedron (Fig. S2, SI). The composition of Step-III is mainly CCAM, and there is no detection of the characteristic CdTMT FT-IR peaks (Fig. S1, SI), which is in agreement with the proposed schematic (Fig. 1F and f). A process of temperature-programmed calcination was adopted to treat the resulted composite to afford the double-shell CdS-C3N4 octahedron (Fig. 1G and g), which has a composition of CdS and C3N4, and shows a phase structure similar to that of CSCN and 1-CSCN (Fig. S3, SI). Compared with the synthetic methods for multi-shell structures reported in the literature [40–42], the present strategy not only opens an avenue for the synthesis of double-shell CdS with hollow structures but also provides a way to manipulate shell composition.\nAs showed in Figs. 2A, B and S4 (SI), the 2-CSCN sample of octahedron appearance is porous and double-shell structured, with size mainly ranging from 800 to 1200 nm. The two shells are rough and made up of numerous nanoparticles. Between the outer and inner shell, there is the presence of gaps, and inside the core, a cavity. It is envisaged that the pores and gaps are beneficial for light scattering as well as reactant/product transfer. Unlike bulk samples, there is easy migration of photogenerated charges to the surfaces of 2-CSCN because of the thin shells (about 50 nm). In addition, the coupling of CdS particles with C3N4 (Fig. 2C) results in ample formation of heterojunctions, and according to EDS elemental mapping the distribution of C, N, Cd and S elements in 2-CSCN is uniform (Fig. 2D–G).\nThe composition and surface nature of 2-CSCN were analyzed by XPS and EDS. As shown in Fig. S5 (SI), there is the detection of Cd, S, N, C and O elements, and the high-resolution Cd 3d and S 2p spectra\nconfirm the presence of CdS [43]. The N 1s profile can be deconvoluted into three peaks: the one at 398.4 eV for sp2-hybridized nitrogen in triazine rings (CeN]C), the one at 400.1 eV for tertiary nitrogen Ne (C)3, and the one at 401.3 eV for CeNeH(2) (Fig. S5d) [44,45]. Overall, the XRD, XPS and EDS (Fig. S5f) results illustrate that the targeted CdS-C3N4 material has been successfully synthesized. Moreover, the specific surface area of 2-CSCN is (116.3 m2 g−1) much larger than that of single-shell CdS-C3N4 octahedron (1-CSCN, 52.0m2 g−1) and CdS-C3N4 composite (CSCN, 7.3m2 g−1) (Tables S1, SI).\nThe effect of synthetic conditions on structural evolution was investigated. As revealed in SEM and TEM observations (Fig. S6, SI), the hydrothermal temperature plays a key role. The yolk-shell structure is generated at ca. 140 °C, whereas single-shell hollow structure at ca. 180 °C. However, in our previous work, under hydrothermal conditions CdTMT was found stable below 140 °C and the octahedral structure was found broken down into small particles at 160 °C [32]. These results suggest that a match of CdTMT decomposition rate and hydrogen bond formation rate is essential for the establishment of multi-shell structure. In Fig. S7 (SI), the yolk-shell structure is converted into hollow octahedron by prolonging hydrothermal treatment time, which is caused by a decrease of melamine diffusion rate toward the inner core. Taking hydrogen bonding (which acts as stabilizer for the octahedron structure) into account, we investigated the effect of NaOH amount on structure evolution (Fig. S8, SI). There is a breakdown of octahedral structure to small particles in the absence of NaOH. When NaOH content is low, the formed octahedrons are irregular in shape. In acidic or neutral situations, protons from water or acid would replace one or more of the cadmium atoms in CdTMT, forming trithiocyanuric acid as a result [33]. As a consequence, CA is not timely generated to maintain the octahedral structure. It is only when NaOH is in excess that there is acceleration of CdTMT decomposition, and the formation of yolk-shell hollow structure. It was found that the optimized condition for getting the double-shell composite with porous and hollow structure is: 160 °C for 2 h with 0.24 g of NaOH.\nWe conducted UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic experiments\nto investigate the optical properties of the as-prepared samples. Bulk C3N4 (CN) exhibits an obvious absorption edge at ca. 450 nm, while 2- CSCN shows strong visible light absorption in the range of 400–700 nm (Fig. 3A). With the formation of the double shells, light harvesting capacity increases in both UV and visible light range. It is in agreement with the reported results that a multi-shell hollow structure with outer and inner shells is better than a single-shell one in light harvesting [46,47]. Meanwhile, the large specific surface area of the former not only facilitates light absorption but also enlarges the exposure of active sites for redox reactions. A combination of these positive effects would enable a porous multi-shell composite to perform well in photocatalytic reactions.\nRoom temperature photoluminescence (PL) as well as photo-\nelectron responses were carried out to investigate the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. As exhibited in Fig. 3B, the peak intensity of the samples are in the order of CN > CdS > CSCN > 1-CSCN > 2-CSCN. It is noted that the trend based on photocurrent intensity (i.e., CN < CdS < CSCN < 1-CSCN < 2-CSCN) and that based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) investigations, (i.e., CN > CdS > CSCN > 1-CSCN > 2-CSCN) is in harmony with the PL trend (Fig. 3C and D). On the basis of the PL, photocurrent intensity and EIS results, it is deduced that high light utilization (in consistence with the UV–vis absorption results) and excellent electrontransfer efficiency (type-II heterojunction was formed between CdS and C3N4) can be achieved over 2-CSCN.\nThe photocatalytic performance of the prepared samples were\nevaluated for hydrogen production and selective oxidation of saturated CeH bonds under visible light irradiation. The average hydrogen evolution rate over C3N4, CdS, CSCN, 1-CSCN and 2-CSCN is ca. trace, 52.7, 81.7, 192.6 and 292.6 μmol h−1, respectively (Fig. 4A). The 2-CSCN photocatalyst not only shows the highest activity among the as-prepared samples, but also the highest apparent quantum efficiency (420 nm) among the reported CdS-C3N4 composites at similar reaction conditions (Table S2, SI). The double-shell structure of the composites shows a great influence on photocatalytic activity. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 2-CSCN for hydrogen generation under monochromatic irradiation of 420 nm was calculated to be 17.2%. The excellent photocatalytic activity can also be ascribed to the rich presence of heterojunctions between CdS and C3N4 [48]. Besides, the thin shells endowed with abundant pores allow efficient charge transport across the surfaces, further inhibiting the recombination of charge carriers [20].\nTo investigate the stability of 2-CSCN, five consecutive cycles of the photocatalytic reaction were performed and each cycle lasted for 3 h (Fig. 4B). No apparent decrease of activity was detected, evidencing that the coating of C3N4 on CdS restrains photocorrosion. The schematic of energy level configuration and transfer process of photogenerated charge carriers is presented in Fig. S9 (SI). Under visible light, the unique mesoporous double shells and the cavities of 2-CSCN enables multiple reflections and scattering of light, thus enhancing light harvesting and offering more photogenerated electrons and holes [2,3]. Also, the hierarchical morphology of 2-CSCN facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. In detail, the photogenerated electrons on the LUMO level of C3N4 readily move into the conduction band of CdS, while the photogenerated holes on the valence band of CdS transfer to the HOMO of C3N4 [49]. In other words, there is enrichment of excited electrons in CdS and holes in C3N4. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes on CdS rapidly migrate to C3N4 and thus substantially alleviates the problem of CdS photocorrosion [50]. At last, H2O molecules undergo redox reactions at the catalytic centers, generating H2 as a consequence.\nThe selective oxidation of saturated CeH bonds is one of the most fundamental processes in the synthesis of fine chemicals [51–53]. It has been demonstrated that at ambient conditions under visible light irradiation, heterogeneous photocatalysis proivdes a promising alternative for selective activation of CeH bonds [54]. In this study, the selective oxidation of toluene without solvent in the presence of O2 and visible light was taken as model reaction. Under N2 atmosphere or in the absence of a photocatalyst and/or light illumination, there is no detection of products, indicating the reaction is photocatalytic and O2 (a green oxidant) is indispensable. It was observed that among the synthesized catalysts, 2-CSCN performs the best, showing benzaldehyde production rate of 475 μmol g−1 h−1 at a selectivity of up to 95% (Fig. 4C). Only a small amount of benzyl alcohol and no further oxidation products such as CO and CO2 are detected. It was found that the approach is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives (Fig. 5). It is noted that the oxidation of ethylbenzene or n-propylbenzene produces ketones rather than aldehydes, indicating only the alpha carbon of CeH bond is activated in this photocatalytic system. As revealed in Figs. 4D and S10 (SI), the loss of photoactivity across a test of 10 runs is insignificant, indicating high stability of 2-CSCN. Based on the results of scavenger experiments (Fig. S11 and discussions, SI), a possible reaction mechanism for partial oxidation of toluene over 2-CSCN is proposed and illustrated (Fig. S12, SI). The direct oxidation of toluene for the formation of toluene cationic radicals as facilitated by the holes is a key step. This step involves the activation of saturated CeH bonds which is often regarded as the rate-determining step for the selective oxidation of alkanes. Meanwhile, the electrons react with adsorbed O2 to give activated oxygen species that selectively oxidize the cationic radicals, leading to the formation of benzaldehyde [55,56]."

The coupling of CdS with C3N4 prevents the self-photooxidation of CdS and thus results in high photocatalyst stability. Owing to the porous and hollow structure, there is enhanced light absorption. Endowed with thin shells and heterostructures beneficial for the transfer of photogenerated charges, the CdS@C3N4 materials show much higher photocatalytic activity than its individual components as well as the single-shell CdS@C3N4 counterpart. The present work sheds light on the feasibility of similar approaches for the synthesis of advanced nanostructures of composition complexity targeted for specific applications."

By virtue of compositional and structural advantages, the CdS@C3N4 composites exhibit outstanding activity and stability in photocatalytic H2 generation and selective oxidation of saturated CeH bonds.",
