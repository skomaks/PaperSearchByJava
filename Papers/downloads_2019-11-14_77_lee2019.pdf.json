      "text" : "Hemagglutinin (HA) displayed on a ferritin nano-cage has been shown to be effective in generating a potent immune response against a broad range of influenza infections. Here, we showed that conjugation of flagellin together with HA to the exterior surface of the ferritin cage greatly enhanced not only the humoral immune response in mice but also antigen-specific T cell responses that include Th1 cytokine secretion. The effect of flagellin remained essentially unchanged when the molar ratio of flagellin to HA was reduced from 1:1 to 1:3. Injection of the ferritin-HA-flagellin cage provided protection against lethal virus challenge in mice. We used a small immunoglobulin fragment VL12.3 as a convenient method for attaching HA and flagellin to the ferritin cage. This attachment method can be used for rapid screening of a variety of protein cages and nano-assemblies to identify the most suitable carrier and adjuvant proteins for the target antigen. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ferritin cages are formed by self-assembly of 24 copies of identical ~20 kDa subunits.1 They have a well-defined hollow spherical shape with a diameter of 12 nm and can be easily and accurately manipulated by genetic modification and chemical conjugation.2 These properties endow ferritin with the potential for clinical applications such as targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs and diagnostic agents, and anticancer drugs, ions and metals can be encapsulated in the ferritin cages or genetically fused to the outside of the cages.3–6 Influenza\nConflict of interest: The authors declare that no conflict of interest exists.\nFunding: Korea Health Technology R&D Project funded by the Ministry of Health&Welfare (HI15C1886), by the Intelligent Synthetic BiologyCenter of the Global Frontier Project (2011-0031955), and by theNationalResearchFoundation (2017M3A9F6029753, 2017R1A2A1A17069497).\n⁎Corresponding authors.

It has also been used to produce a candidate vaccine against a broad range of influenza strains by displaying a relatively invariable region of HA on the ferritin surface.9\nFlagellin stimulates both innate and adaptive immune responses via multiple pathways10 including TLR511,12 and the Naip5 inflammasome,13,14 and initiates mixed Th1/Th2 responses.15,16 It is the principal component of the bacterial flagellum, forming a hollow cylindrical filament. Its structure can be divided into 4 domains, D0 to D3.D1andD2are themain recognition sites forTLR5.TLR5binding is mediated mainly by the D1 domain.17 The D2 domain bridges two flagellins when bound to TLR5, and increases the activation of TLR5. The D0 domain is responsible for polymerization of the flagellin18,19 but is not directly involved inTLR5binding.17,20 However, it contains a short sequence that is critical for activation of Naip5 and contributes to immunostimulatory activity.13,21\nthe immunostimulatory activity of a hemagglutinin-ferritin nano-cage. 012\nDirect fusion of antigens to flagellin can generate stronger immune responses than simple mixtures of antigen and flagellin.10,22–24 Antigens can be fused to either the N- or Cterminus or the hypervariable D2/D3 domains.24–29 Flagellin has significant advantages as a vaccine adjuvant: it is effective at very low doses,30 does not promote IgE responses31 and can be easily produced in large quantities using recombinant DNA technology. Prior immunity to flagellin and the presence of antiflagellin antibodies do not impair its adjuvant activity.31,32 The safety and ability of flagellin-antigen fusion proteins to induce protective levels of serum antibodies have been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies of flagellin-based candidate influenza vaccines.33–41 Flagellins are implicated in inflammatory diseases, such as acute lung inflammation, cardiovascular collapse, inflammatory bowel disease and liver damage. However, in the concentration range in which the flagellins are typically used as adjuvants, these inflammatory effects are negligible.39\nIn this report, we show that attaching flagellin to the exterior surface of the HA-ferritin cage enhances the potency and breadth of the immunostimulatory activity of the cage. This stimulates total IgG production, class switching to IgG2a and antigenspecific T cell responses that include Th1 cytokine secretion when injected into mice. The molar ratio of the antigen and flagellin on the ferritin can be optimized simply by changing the relative amounts of the two proteins in the attachment reaction, and the relative orientation of flagellin to the ferritin cage can be optimized by moving the conjugation site to different regions of flagellin; this has been shown to be important for activity. The small immunoglobulin fragment against huntingtin protein (HTT), VL12.3,\n42 has been used to attach HA and the protective antigen of Bacillus anthracis43 to the ferritin cage, and to attach HA to the artificial cage protein I3–01.44 This method is suitable for quick screening of optimal cages and adjuvants for given antigens by simply changing the cage and adjuvant proteins in the attachment reactions without the need for optimization of the production and purification protocols of all the candidate antigen-adjuvant-cage fusion combinations."

      "text" : "Site specific attachment of an antigen and flagellin to the surface of bacterial ferritin\nIn order to attach an antigen and flagellin to the surface of ferritin, we used the VL12.3 antibody. It is a single domain antibody fragment containing 115 amino acids (Figure 1).42 It binds with high affinity to a fourteen amino acid peptide derived from human huntingtin protein (HTT). The VL12.3 domain can be attached to the N-terminus, C-terminus of flagellin, or to a flexible loop of the D3 domain since the D3 domain is not involved in the interaction with TLR5 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1). We chose influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) (A/California/04/2009, H1N1) as the antigen to test the adjuvant activity of the ferritin-flagellin cage. The VL12.3 domain was fused to the C-terminus of HA to attach it to the ferritin cage (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S2), and the HTT sequence was fused to the N-terminus of E. coli ferritin for stable binding of HA and flagellin to the ferritin.\nAlthough the original VL12.3 binds to the HTT peptide with nanomolar affinity, we were concerned about the stability of this non-covalent interaction after injection into mice. To create an irreversible covalent bond between VL12.3 and HTT, a disulfide bridge was designed using the Disulfide-by-Design webserver for covalent conjugation (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/DbD2/),46 and the two cysteine mutations, Y53C for VL12.3 and A6C for HTT, were generated to form the disulfide bond (Figure 2, A and B). In order to check for formation of the intended disulfide bridges, FtnHA and Ftn-ΔFliC(I, F) cages were prepared and the positions of the Ftn-HA and Ftn-ΔFliC(I, F) bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were compared under reducing and the non-reducing conditions. As expected, HA and the truncated flagellins fused with VL12.3migrated under reducing conditions as 71 and 59 kDa bands, respectively, (Figure S1). However, under non-reducing conditions, both Ftn-HA and Ftn-ΔFliC(I, F) were shifted upwards, demonstrating that disulfide bridges had formed. In the non-reducing conditions, free flagellin almost completely disap-\npeared and more than 90% of the HA band was shifted upwards. The identities of the shifted bands of Ftn-HA and Ftn-ΔFliC(I, F) were verified by western blotting using anti-Influenza A virus HA (H1N1) monoclonal antibody or anti-flag M2 antibody (Figure S1). Although the molecular weight of HA is higher than that of flagellin, the Ftn-HA bands were slightly lower than that of FtnΔFliC(I, F) in the non-reducing conditions, presumably because internal disulfide bonds in HA affected migration. Ferritin fused with HTT has an MW of 22 kDa and could not be seen under reducing conditions on 12% gels (Figure S1).\nSimilarly, Ftn-HA and doubly conjugated Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I) cages were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions. As seen in Figure 2, C, HA and ΔFliC(I) of the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I) cage migrated at the expected positions in the 15% reducing gel. Ferritin fused to HTT peptide also displayed the expected molecular weight of 22 kDa. However, in non-reducing conditions these bands were shifted to higher molecular weight positions. The identities of the shifted bands of Ftn-HA were verified by western blotting using anti-HA antibody (Figure 2, C, right). These data demonstrate that the intended disulfide bridge had formed between HTT and VL12.3, and therefore Ftn and HA, and Ftn and flagellin, were irreversibly linked. Stable and simultaneous conjugation of HA and flagellin to the ferritin in the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I, F) cage was further verified by reciprocal immunoprecipitation (Figure S2, A) and by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 3, A). When visualized by negatively stained election microscopy, non-conjugated ferritin had a smooth and round shape, whereas in conjugated Ftn-HAΔFliC branches protruded from round particles (Figure S2, B). To test for conjugation of the full-length flagellin with an intact Nterminal D0 domain, Ftn-HA-FliC(I) was prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting. In the blotted gel, anti-HA and anti-Salmonella flagella antibody detected equivalent protein bands from a purified sample (Figure S2, C).\nIn order to demonstrate the general utility of the VL12.3-HTT system for protein conjugation to the cage, we used this method to attach domain 4 of Bacillus anthracis Protective Antigen (PA) to the ferritin cage, and HA to the artificial cage protein I3-01 (Figure 3, B and C and Supplementary Figure S3). PA is one of the three toxin proteins secreted by Bacillus anthracis. It is composed of four domains (domains 1 to 4).47 Domain 4 mediates binding of PA to the capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) receptor and is the recognition site of an anthrax neutralizing antibody.43 I3-01 is a computationally-designed protein that forms a 250 angstrom cage composed of 60 monomeric subunits.44 For conjugation, the VL12.3 domain was genetically fused to the C-terminus of the domain 4 of PA, and the HTT sequence was fused to the N-terminus of I3-01 (Supplementary Table S2). As shown in the SEC elution profiles and SDS-PAGE, PA and HA were stably attached to the ferritin and I3-01 cages, respectively (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3).\nSelecting the sites in flagellin for attachment to the ferritin cage\nIt has been reported that full-length flagellin containing the D0 domain has at least 60-fold higher activity in stimulating immune response than a truncated form with the D0 domain\ndeleted.19,48 The D0 domain, however, often makes it difficult to produce recombinant flagellin protein because it tends to increase proteolytic degradation and polymerization.17–19,48,49 In order to test the effect of the D0 domain in the ferritin nanocage system, we used both full-length (D0 to D3, FliC) and truncated (D1 to D3, ΔFliC) flagellin. The VL12.3 domain was fused to the N-termini of these proteins to attach the latter to the\nferritin cage. The flagellin-ferritin nano-cages, Ftn-ΔFliC(N) and Ftn-FliC(N), were first tested for activation of TLR5 signaling using HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing TLR5 and the NF-κB reporter. As shown in Figure 4, A, the full-length flagellin had only 1.4~2.3 times more activity than the truncated flagellin. To compare immune responses in mice, influenza A virus HA was attached to the ferritin nano-cages together with\nthe truncated and full-length flagellin to generate cages Ftn-HAΔFliC(N) and Ftn-HA-FliC(N), respectively. The assembled cages were injected subcutaneously into mice, and IgG responses were measured by ELISA of sera after priming and boosting injections. Serum IgG1 levels were comparable in the two cases (Figure 4, B). However, the truncated flagellin yielded 2.1 and 2.7 times higher levels, respectively, of total IgG and IgG2a. Therefore, we concluded that the D0 domain of flagellin has only a minor effect on the IgG response in our flagellin-ferritin system, and the truncated flagellin was used for making ferritin nano-cages in subsequent experiments.\nIn order to identify the best attachment site for flagellin, the VL12.3 domain was fused to its N- or C-terminus or D3 domain (intermediate site, I), and the modified flagellins were conjugated\nwith HTT-fused ferritin (Figure 1). When the assembled flagellin-ferritin nano-cages were tested for activation of TLR5 signaling, the non-conjugated mixture of ferritin and flagellin, Ftn + ΔFliC, had negligible activity and all the flagellinconjugated nano-cages increased the TLR5 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4, C). Those with ferritin attached to either the N-terminus or the D3 domain of the truncated flagellin, Ftn-ΔFliC(N) or Ftn-ΔFliC(I), had 1.3~1.9 times higher activity than when ferritin was attached in the Cterminus, Ftn-ΔFliC(C). Thus conjugation of either the Nterminus or D3 domain of the truncated flagellin with ferritin generates Ftn-ΔFliC nano-cages that are effective in stimulating the TLR5 signaling pathway. Since the D3 domain is not involved in the interaction with TLR5, we chose to fuse it with\nthe VL12.3 domain to produce the flagellin-conjugated ferritin nano-cages used in subsequent experiments.\nAttachment of flagellin to the HA-ferritin cage enhances the humoral immune response\nSince flagellin-ferritin nano-cages activated TLR5 more effectively than non-conjugated flagellin (Figure 4, C), we\ntested if they induced stronger adjuvant responses by performing ELISAs against HA using sera obtained after two immunizations. In contrast to what was observed in the in vitro TLR5 activation assay, mixtures of the flagellin-ferritin cages and HA, Ftn-ΔFliC+HA, induced much weaker serum IgG responses, similar to the mixture of non-conjugated flagellin, ferritin and HA, Ftn + ΔFliC+HA, (Figure 5, A). However, the ferritin cage conjugated with both flagellin and\nHA (Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I)) induced a 13.3-fold higher IgG response than Ftn-HA, and ~370-fold higher than a mixture of flagellinferritin cages and HA, (Ftn-ΔFliC+HA) (Figure 5, A and B). In an ELISA test against inactivated QIV containing the A/ California/07/2009 H1N1 virus, the IgG responses in the sera from mice injected with Ftn-HA-ΔFliC were 4.3-fold higher\nthan those from mice injected with Ftn-HA (Figure 5, C). The endpoint dilutions against QIV were lower than those against HA, probably because QIV is a mixture of four denatured viruses. These results demonstrate that Ftn-HA-ΔFliC is a potent humoral immune inducer, and are consistent with previous reports that fusions of antigens and flagellin induce\nstronger immune responses than simple mixture of the two components.10,24 They also demonstrate that direct fusion of HA and flagellin is not essential but that simultaneous\nconjugation of HA and flagellin to a common ferritin cage can also induce strong serum antibody responses, and they show that flagellin attached to the HA-ferritin cage is a potent adjuvant.\nThe minimum amount of flagellin required for a humoral immune response\nTo discover the minimum amount of flagellin on HA-ferritin cages required for adjuvant activity, we produced Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages with molar ratios of HA to flagellin ranging from 1:1 to 4:1. The resulting cages were injected twice into mice and serum levels of total IgG and its subclasses were measured. As shown in Figure 5, D, the molar ratio of flagellin to HA could be reduced to approximately 1:3 without significantly affecting the IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a immune responses. At a ratio of 1:4, total IgG and IgG1 production was not significantly affected, but the level of IgG2a induced by the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages was 4.8-fold lower than that induced by the 1:1 cages. Thus, the ratio of serum IgG1 to IgG2a increased 4.0-fold when the flagellin to HA ratio fell fourfold. A lower ratio of IgG1/IgG2a tilts the immunization outcome towards a Th1 immune response since class switching of immunoglobulins is mainly affected by the interaction of B lymphocytes with specific cytokines such as IL-4, which is required for making IgG1, and IFN-γ, which is needed for making IgG2a.\n50–54 Serum IgG2b was also reduced by 35.1% in response to the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC 4:1 cages. These data show that the minimum amount of flagellin on HA-ferritin cages required for significant Th1-responses is a molar ratio of approximately 1:3 of flagellin to HA in our experimental conditions.\nKanekiyo et al have reported that genetic fusion of HA to ferritin leads to the formation of nanoparticles with 24 molecules of HA displayed on the ferritin cage.7 They found that their HAferritin nanoparticles induced about 1.6-fold higher activity in the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay than trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Our Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages contain only 10 molecules of HA on the ferritin cage, which is composed of 24 molecules of ferritin. We tested the effect of the number of HA molecules displayed on serum immunoglobulin levels. For this purpose, we produced an Ftn-HA(low) cage with only 4 molecules of HA and a Ftn-HA(high) cage with 24 molecules of HA, and compared their immunostimulatory activities. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, the Ftn-HA(high) cage induced stronger total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b responses than the Ftn-HA(low) cage. However, when Ftn-HA(high) was compared to Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I, 24:10:3.3), its total IgG and its subclass responses, other than of IgG1, were significantly lower than those of the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I, 24:10:3.3). In particular, the IgG2a and IgG2b levels induced by the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC(I, 24:10:3.3) cage were 1.8 and 7.0 times higher, respectively, than those induced by the Ftn-HA(high) cage. Therefore, these results indicate that although maximally-conjugated HA is useful for inducing humoral immune responses, flagellin has to be conjugated to the ferritin cage in order to produce adequate IgG2a and IgG2b and, thus, an efficient nano-cage with self-adjuvant activity.\nAttachment of flagellin to the HA-ferritin cage promotes antigen-specific T cell responses\nFlagellin is a powerful stimulant for both humoral and cellmediated immune responses. To determine whether simultaneous conjugation of HA and flagellin to the ferritin cage induces antigen-specific T cell responses, levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-9 and\nIL-17, which are secreted by Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 cells, respectively, were measured by ELISA in the supernatants of splenocytes of mice injected with Ftn-HA and Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages. As shown in Figure 6, when splenocytes from the FtnHA-ΔFliC-injected mice were stimulated with a complete protein-scanning mixture of HA peptides, secretion of the major Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, was 3.9-fold higher than from splenocytes from the Ftn-HA-injected mice. Although secretion of IL-9 from the splenocytes from the Ftn-HA-ΔFliC-injected mice was 5.3-fold higher, the secretion level itself was low. The IL-4 level was not significantly enhanced by attachment of flagellin to the Ftn-HA cage and IL-17 secretion remained basal in all samples.\nAttachment of flagellin to the HA-ferritin cage enhances recovery from lethal virus challenge\nTo determine whether the Ftn-HA and Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages protected against live virus infection, immunized mice were challenged with lethal doses of homologous pandemic H1N1 virus (A/California/7/2009) 2 weeks after the second immunization. All naïve mice and those immunized with empty cages died within 7 days, whereas those immunized with Ftn-HA and Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages survived like mice immunized with 2016- 2017 QIV, which contains inactivated H1N1 virus (A/California/ 7/2009) (Figure 7, A). In terms of body weight recovery, FtnHA-ΔFliC appeared to have the advantage over Ftn-HA; thus mice immunized with Ftn-HA-ΔFliC or QIV started to gain body weight quickly, reaching 92% of their original weight in 6~7 days, while those injected with Ftn-HA only recovered ~90% of their body weight in 8~9 days. These results indicate that immunization with Ftn-HA-ΔFliC cages is superior to immunization with Ftn-HA with respect to recovery from lethal virus challenge, although further research with more animals is needed to confirm this conclusion."

      "heading" : "Discussion",
      "text" : "In this study, we have shown that flagellin improves the immunostimulatory activity of the ferritin cage by enhancing total IgG level, class switching to IgG2a and cytokine secretion by splenocytes. Previously, ferritin cages have been shown to be suitable carriers for inducing a stem-specific immune response to influenza hemagglutinin.7 They can be modified to present diverse influenza virus HAs using standard molecular cloning strategies, and are readily produced homogeneously and in large quantities.55 In our study, we showed that the immune response induced by the HA-ferritin system was adequate in terms of IgG1 production, but that class switching to IgG2a and IgG2b, and IFNγ secretion, were limited. We showed that this limitation could be overcome by attaching flagellin to the HA-ferritin system. The attachment of flagellin enhanced the secretion of IFN-γ required for IgG2a production. IgG2a and IgG2b interact with various Fcγ receptors and are the most powerful IgG subclasses involved in degranulation, phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Therefore, flagellin-conjugated HA-ferritin could be useful for producing more effective influenza vaccines.\nUnlike other adjuvants such as aluminum salt orMPLA, flagellin needs to be closely associated with the antigen to be effective.10,24 This closeness is usually achieved by fusing flagellin to the antigen as a subunit vaccine, presenting the fused antigen on VLPs and conjugating them chemically to gold nanoparticles.8,22,23 In our method we fused the flagellin and antigen indirectly by attaching themboth to the ferritin cage. This has several advantages. First, one\ncan quickly and easily optimize the molar ratios of antigen, flagellin and ferritin, since these proteins are produced separately and assembled later by simply mixing them. Flagellins, like other adjuvants, have significant toxicity when used at high concentration.10,39,40 Therefore, minimizing the amount of flagellin can be important for vaccine development. In the genetic fusion method the ratio of flagellin to antigen can only be changed\nB\nB o d y w\ne ig\nh t ( %\n)\nPBS\nFtn\nFtn HA\nFtn HA FliC(I)\nQIV\n2 4 6 8 10\n100\n90\n80\n70\nDays post infection\n0\noup were challenged with 10 LD50 of H1N1 virus (A/California/7/2009) after itored daily.

Secondly, one can rapidly identify the best nano-cages for specific antigens and adjuvants because they are produced separately and can be mixed during the attachment step. For example, 1,000 different nano-cages can be quickly generated without any additional cloning or expression optimization steps by mixing 10 representatives each of the antigens, adjuvants and cages. Previously, nano-cage systems were produced by genetic fusion of antigen and cage protein,2,7,9,57 and the production of fusion proteins requires optimization and takes time.\nIn the present work we used the VL12.3 immunoglobulin domain as a universal linker for attachment of the antigen and flagellin to the ferritin cage. Previously, Leneghan et al have shown that the Spytag and Spycatcher system can serve as a universal linker.58 However, overproduction of fusions between the Spytag and host proteins is not always possible.59 Our VL12.3 system offers an alternative way to cross-link antigens and cages. Finally, the VL12.3 domain has minimal immunostimulatory activity (Supplementary Figure S5) and so is unlikely to interfere with the immune response to antigens and adjuvants. Ferritin induces strong antibody responses, as shown previously.7 However, it appears to have little impact on vaccine effectiveness, since HAferritin cages are currently being evaluated in a clinical trial.55\nIt has been shown that flagellin activates TLR5by binding to it and inducing its dimerization.17 The D0 domain is dispensable for TLR5 binding and activation.17,20 However, it can enhance the stimulatory activity of flagellin ~60-fold.19,48 This is in part due to activation of the Naip5 inflammasome by a region of the D0 domain. The D0 domain induces polymerization of flagellin18,19 and therefore can increase the stimulatory activity of antigen-flagellin fusions.60 We found here that theD0 domain actually reduced the adjuvant activity of flagellinwhen it was attached to the ferritin cage by our method. Further research is needed to clarify why the Naip5-activating activity of flagellin is not needed in our system. In any case, this is an advantage of the ferritinantigen-flagellin system because the D0 domain is highly susceptible to proteolysis and can interferewith the production of antigen-flagellin fusion proteins.17–21,49 In summary, simultaneous attachment of flagellin and antigen enhances the immunostimulatory effect of ferritin cages. This outcome can be exploited for rapid screening of a variety of protein cages and nano-assemblies to identify the most suitable carrier and adjuvant protein for the target antigen. Future research using diverse antigens from other pathogenic microorganisms should be useful for vaccine development."

    "abstractText" : "Hemagglutinin (HA) displayed on a ferritin nano-cage has been shown to be effective in generating a potent immune response against a broad range of influenza infections. Here, we showed that conjugation of flagellin together with HA to the exterior surface of the ferritin cage greatly enhanced not only the humoral immune response in mice but also antigen-specific T cell responses that include Th1 cytokine secretion. The effect of flagellin remained essentially unchanged when the molar ratio of flagellin to HA was reduced from 1:1 to 1:3. Injection of the ferritin-HA-flagellin cage provided protection against lethal virus challenge in mice. We used a small immunoglobulin fragment VL12.3 as a convenient method for attaching HA and flagellin to the ferritin cage. This attachment method can be used for rapid screening of a variety of protein cages and nano-assemblies to identify the most suitable carrier and adjuvant proteins for the target antigen. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
