      "text" : "With the development of advanced nanotechnology in recent decades, nanocarriers have emerged and gained popularity in biomedicine [1]. Nanocarriers serve not only as carriers of routine chemotherapeutic agents due to their drug encapsulation capacity but also as platforms for combinational therapy, multifunctional diagnosis and theranostics. As an ideal multifunctional drug delivery system (DDS), nanocarriers have been applied for various disease therapies, such as passive targeting due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, active targeting facilitated by ligand modification of the surface of nanoplatforms, and site-specific and time-controlled drug delivery strategies mediated by stimuli-responsive materials [2].\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, 290; doi:10.3390/pharmaceutics12030290 www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, 290 2 of 25\nNanogels, a type of systemic drug delivery carrier, are hydrogels with a three-dimensional (3D) tunable porous structure and a particle size in the submicrometer range, from 20 to 250 nm; nanogels can be discriminated from microgels, which have a particle size ranging from 1 to 350 µm, and in situ-forming hydrogels, which facilitate local delivery [3]. Nanogels are composed of various natural polymers, synthetic polymers, or combinations thereof, which contributes to the encapsulation of small molecules, oligonucleotides, and even proteins. These unique properties equip nanogels with the abilities to enable drug delivery, diagnostics, and imaging [4]. As a kind of hydrogel, nanogels retain the highly hydrated nature and shrinking-swelling properties of hydrogels under different environmental conditions [5]. Their 3D structure enables the encapsulation of hydrophobic or hydrophilic drugs in their internal network, potentially protecting these drugs from degradation during storage or in circulation (such as degradation due to hydrolysis or enzymolysis) [6]. Unlike typical nanoparticles (NPs), nanogels exhibit a tunable particle size, particle shape, and sensitivity to pH, temperature, ionic strength, redox conditions and other external stimuli, giving them effective controlled drug release properties [7]. Furthermore, nanogels can be tailored to be multifunctional and targeted, and their circulation time can be prolonged by surface modification [8]. Based on the above advantages, nanogel-based DDSs have become popular and had significant impacts in recent years. In this review, we summarize recent developments in nanogels and their biomedical application in drug delivery (Scheme 1). In addition to the composition of nanogels and methods of their preparation, the construction of various pH-responsive, temperature-responsive, dual pH/temperature-responsive and triple pH/temperature/redox-responsive nanogels are presented in detail. Moreover, targeted ligands, such as promising small molecules, peptides and antibodies on the surface of nanogels, enable the development of nanogels with active targeting properties.

      "heading" : "2.2. Chemical Crosslinking",
      "text" : "Beyond physical crosslinking, chemical crosslinking is the most developed and more versatile strategy for nanogel construction. Chemical crosslinking methods include polymerization by emulsion, reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), click chemistry crosslinking, and photo-induced crosslinking [13]. Amino crosslinking is often used for the preparation of biodegradable nanogels based on amino acids [14].\n2.2.1. Inverse Emulsion Polymerization\nInverse emulsion polymerization is a polymerization reaction initiated by the continuous emulsification of water-in-oil emulsifiers in the oil phase. The sizes of nanogels can be regulated by many factors, such as the surfactant, feed ratio of the monomer and crosslinker, and pH [11]. For example, Ashrafizadeh et al. synthesized zwitterionic poly(AA-BA-EGDMA) nanogels by using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), butyl acrylate (BA) and acrylic acid (AA) as monomers [9]. Using N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS) and N-acryloyl-l-glutamic acid (l-AGA), Peres and co-workers prepared poly(l-AGA) and poly(l-AGA-co-BIS) hydrogels by inverse emulsion polymerization, which demonstrated that the degree of hydrogel swelling increased with variation of pH [15]. Furthermore, the presence of carboxylic acid and amide groups in a polymer network plays important roles in the physicochemical properties of the polymer network, thereby affecting its hydrophilicity and hydration.\n2.2.2. Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) Polymerization\nThrough RAFT, a polymer undergoes a series of reactions with dithioester compounds; these reactions include reversible addition, reversible degradation of adducts, and chain transfer reactions and control the molecular weight of the polymer during free radical polymerization. RAFT technology can change the micelle structure of amphiphilic polymers by altering the length, configuration and properties of the polymers. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) has become an interesting biocompatible and temperature-sensitive polymer [16]. In addition, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAC) is an attractive polymer that can be used to adjust the phase transition temperature of PVCL, which is known as a kind of biocompatible and temperature-sensitive polymer, by promoting the noncovalent hydrophobic interactions between VAC and VCL. By adjusting the ratio of VAC and VAL during RAFT polymerization, Etchenausia et al. obtained a series of thermoresponsive polymers which they named as PEG-b-P(VAC-co-VCL), with xanthate-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-X) as a polymeric chain transfer agent [17].\n2.2.3. Click Chemistry Crosslinking Polymerization\nIn recent decades, emergent hydrogels and nanogels have been associated with click chemistry due to its high reactivity, high yield and superb selectivity [18]. Click chemistry, which includes the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne (CuAAC) click reaction, the copper-free click reaction, and pseudo-click chemistry, has become the most promising strategy for the preparation of nanogels. For instance, a pH-responsive nanogel was obtained through thiol-ene click chemistry, an efficient method of nanogel preparation without byproducts, by polymerization with methoxy polyethylene glycol acrylate (mPEGA), pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate) (PT) and ortho ester diacrylamide (OEAM) [19]. The network of the obtained nanogels was introduced to capture the molecule doxorubicin (DOX), and acid-labile monomer OEAM enabled the DOX-loaded nanogel displayed a pH-triggered release profile with the intracellular acidic environment (Figure 2).\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, 290 5 of 25\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 25\nFigure 2.

Adapted from (Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 2017, 508, 282–290). Copyright (2020) with permission from Elsevier Science.\n2.2.4. Photo-Induced Crosslinking Polymerization\nThe application of irradiation for the preparation of nanogels is becoming popular due to its bacteriostatic effect, additive-free nature, multifunctional nature, tunable particle diameter and ability to promote crosslinking. In the process of irradiation, water molecules break down into hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms with the potential to convert polymers into microradicals, leading to intermolecular crosslinking, which promotes nanogel formulation [20]. Consequently, the crosslinking density can be adjusted by regulating the wavelength or energy of the laser [21]. In addition, there are optical crosslinking methods using photoinitiators; for instance, Irgacure 2959 was applied to prepare lipid-coated nanogels which could reduce the drug release rate of docetaxel, compared to that of uncrosslinked drugs [22,23].\n3. Stimuli-Responsive Nanogels\nThe use of stimuli-responsive systems for drug delivery has received increasing attention and mainly utilizes the special conditions of the tumor microenvironment, including a low pH, high temperature, and high glutathione (GSH) concentration, to achieve targeted drug delivery and release [24]. In this way, the use of stimuli-responsive systems not only decreases the drug dose and systemic toxicity but also weakens toxicity to normal tissues [25]. Nanogels have been widely used as stimuli-responsive systems due to their stability, ease of synthesis, high drug-loading capacity, and ability to be modified in multiple ways. Importantly, nanogels are more highly responsive to mutative environments than other DDSs due to their unique 3D network structures, which easily change in different environments to control drug release [26]; therefore, several common stimuliresponsive nanogels are introduced below.\n3.1. Thermo-Responsive Nanogels\nThermo-responsive nanogels are among the most attractive intelligently responsive DDSs. Thermoresponsive nanogels present shrinkage-swelling behavior with variation in the environmental temperature, which enables a controlled release rate of the drug loaded inside. Moreover, accumulation in the disease-related microenvironment and the improved intracellular uptake efficiency could be achieved by stimulated reduction in particle size, and further benefit the therapeutic outcomes [27–29]. NIPAm is a typical thermosensitive derivative that has been widely applied in biomedicine [30– 32]. Below 32 °C (the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of NIPAm), NIPAm is hydrophilic. It becomes hydrophobic with the agglomeration of NIPAm units and causes the system to shrink when the temperature exceeds its LCST. Moreover, the LCST of pNIPAm can be regulated by chain modifications. Hence, pNIPAm-based copolymers with thermosensitive properties were synthesized\nFigure 2.

      "text" : "The pH-dependent swelli g-shrinki g behavior of the nanogel system is mainly attributabl to the ionizing groups, which could deform by ionization or deionization in response to variation in the pH value. Some scientific research has reported that the microenvironments of tumor tissues (pH 6.5–7.2) and tumor cells (pH 4.5–5.0 in lysosomes, and pH 5.0–6.5 in endosomes) are acidic, when compared\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, 290 7 of 25\nwith the physiological pH of 7.4 in the blood circulation and normal tissues [39–41]. The pH-sensitive monomers methacrylic acid (MAA) and methyl ester (MA) were reported to polymerize nanogels, which maintained a swollen state at basic pH conditions with high permeability. Accompanied by decreasing pH values, the deionization of MAA and MA would lead to the shrinkage of nanogels, resulting in the entrapment of the hydrophobic fluorescent indicator oligothiophene (TF) and the hydrophilic drug DOX. Moreover, the enhanced release of DOX was observed at pH 5.5, which could be attributed to the further shrinkage of pH-sensitive nanogels and the protonation of DOX [42]. Besides the synthetic polymers, the natural polysaccharide–based nanogels with shrinkage-collapse variation were designed for precisely controlled drug release with the stimulus of disease microenvironment. Cholesteryl-modified pullulan polymers were reported to self-assemble under physiological conditions to form a stable network structure of acid-labile cholesterol-bearing pullulan (acL-CHP). However, the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of cholesteryl vinyl ether bonds occurred at pH 4.0, leading to the swelling of the acL-CHP nanogels, and finally resulting in collapse of the nanogels. The acL-CHP was expected to be a promising carrier for protein delivery with controlled release (Figure 3B)."

Peng and coworkers innovated a kind of dual-stimuli nanogel polymerized from NIPAm, MAA and PEGMA that responded to temperature and pH values. The cross-linked p(NIPAm-MAA-PEGMA) nanogels displayed the excellent drug loading and release behavior for hydrophilic model drugs with different molecular weights [54]. Furthermore, the p(NIPAm-MAA-PEGMA) nanogels were introduced as the pH-thermal dual responsive carriers for loading cisplatin (CDDP), which was conjugated with the COOH group from MAA, and the release could be triggered by H+ and Cl− attack. The thermoresponsive nanogels could reduce the Cl−-triggered drug release during circulation, while the acidic environment in the tumor region would achieve the controlled release of CDDP, improving antitumor efficacy and alleviating adverse effects\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, 290 8 of 25\n(Figure 4A) [55]. Besides the physical condition, the intracellular responsive release of glutathione (GSH), an essential antioxidant that specifically reduces the disulfide bonds, was reported at a relatively high concentration in cancer cells (approximately 2–10 mM), which is approximately 1000 times the value of approximately 2–20 µM in normal cells [56].

Small-Molecule Conjugation\nIn recent studies of antitumor targeted therapies, folic acid (FA) has become a prominent target that can specifically interact with cells overexpressing folate receptors (FRs). FRs are overexpressed in human tumor tissues, especially in ovarian cancer tissues, but are seldom expressed in normal tissues. The differential expression of FR in ovarian cancer and other tumor tissues makes it an attractive biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors [60]. The block copolymer poly (ethylene oxide)-b-poly(methacrylic acid) (PEO-b-PMA) was loaded with CDDP and DOX, and further modified with FA to obtain pH-sensitive nanogels.

Consequently, by combining the tumor region enrichment with controlled drug release in the tumor environment, the dual drug-loaded nanogels displayed enhanced therapeutic outcomes in MBA-MD-231 breast cancer model (Figure 6) [66].

The current study of nanogels is mainly focused on overcoming the instability of protein drugs to achieve targeted drug delivery to the tumor tissue. DOX, as a hydrophilic model drug, is generally used to investigate the encapsulation and delivery properties of various nanogels [82]. The drug entrapping and controlled release could be easily fulfilled by swelling-collapse variation in the presence of environmental stimuli [83]. In addition to the hydrophilic molecules, some hydrophobic drugs could also be entrapped in the nanogel network. A Fe3O4 hybrid nanogel system was designed to load the hydrophobic drug rapamycin by interaction with the hydrophobic surface of Fe3O4 inner core. NIPMAm was introduced as the thermoresponsive monomer and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AEMA) as the pH-sensitive monomer to construct the hydrophilic shell of the hybrid nanogel. Furthermore, a collagen IV targeting peptide (KLWVLPK) was conjugated with the amino group of AEMA on the surface of drug-loaded nanogels, enabling the formulation of nanogels that targeted the injured artery, thereby achieving the vascular restenosis therapy [84]."

      "text" : "Unlike chemical drugs, biological macromolecules have the characteristics of large molecular weight, complex structure and biological functions; however, because of these characteristics, regulating the stability and permeability of biomacromolecules is challenging [85]. Therefore, such drugs are transported by a variety of nanometer DDSs [86,87], among which nanogels, composed of nanometer hydrogels, have an excellent drug-loading capacity, stability and hydrophilicity and the potential to be good carriers [88].\n4.2.1. Proteins Delivery\nAs proteins are characterized by poor stability, low permeability, enzymatic degradation and a short half-life, they need to be pharmaceutically modified for therapeutic purposes. Encapsulation in a variety of polymers is an effective way to control drug release and extend drug retention time [89]. Natural (e.g., chitosan, dextran, alginate) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polycaprolactone, acrylic polymers, polyallylamine) were introduced to form nanogels to deliver insulin, with both showing excellent biocompatibility, high permeability and enhanced glucose-based responsiveness. The remarkable advantages of these oral nanogels have enabled great effects on hypoglycemia. Despite the presence of epithelial barriers in the gastrointestinal tract, improved patient compliance was observed with oral insulin administration compared to insulin injection [90]. Mudassir et al. recently designed a pH-sensitive polymethyl methacrylate (MMA)/itaconic acid (IA) nanogel as a carrier for oral insulin to improve its bioavailability [91].\nPharmaceutics 2020, 12, 290 13 of 25\n4.2.2. Nucleic Acid Delivery\nGene therapy is involved in the specific treatments of some genetic diseases by delivery of the therapeutic DNA or RNA sequences. Among these gene therapies, the application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has become an important treatment for gene-related diseases due to the powerful ability of siRNAs to silence genes and effectively and specifically inhibit gene expression [92]. However, as nucleic acids, siRNAs are negatively charged hydrophilic compounds that cannot penetrate the cell surface, and their application is limited by some factors, such as their low transfection rates and short half-lives due to rapid enzymatic degradation [93]. To counter these problems, naked siRNA can be embellished by the biomolecule cholesterol, loaded in liposomes, or linked with polymer nanoparticles during nucleic acid treatment [94]. Furthermore, embellished siRNA can reach specific tissues because of its physicochemical characteristic. The siRNA therapy was realized by a nanogel-based delivery platform. Moreover, this approach is a clear direction for other functional oligonucleotide therapies. The tetrahedral DNA-based (TET) nanogel was introduced as a nonviral vector for siRNA assembly and provided protection during delivery. This strategy can prevent ribonuclease degradation and enable cell transfection effectively in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a promising platform for incorporating multiple devices for increased efficiency (Figure 8) [95].

Hyperthermic conditions induced the efficient cell uptake of NPs with drug loading, stimulated drug release, and enhanced therapeutic outcomes.

Accordingly, many nanosystems for combined PTT and chemotherapy, including inorganic NPs [121], micelles [122], and polymeric NPs [123], have been developed.

Photodynamic Chemotherapy\nPDT has attracted widespread attention as a potential antitumor strategy by locally inducing cancer cell death [126]. PDT primarily involves the use of light at appropriate wavelengths to activate PSs, after which energy is transferred from activated PSs to molecular oxygen, producing highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the singlet oxygen (1O2), inducing tumor cell apoptosis and death [127,128]. Most of PDT processes are oxygen-dependent, and oxygen is continuously consumed during PDT, which severely limits the clinical application of PDT, especially in hypoxic solid tumors [129,130]. In addition, the limited penetration of tumor tissue by the laser reduces the efficacy of PDT [131]. Therefore, the combination of PDT and chemotherapy offers a potent approach to achieve synergistic anticancer effects [132,133]. Nanogels have been employed as a multifunctional delivery platform for chemo-photodynamic combinational therapy. For instance, a redox-sensitive nanogel was constructed for the delivery of the NHS-BODIPY-Br molecule, a heavy atom-modified reactive photosensitizer, and anticancer drug DOX. By the accumulation and controlled drug release in the tumor region, DOX loaded in the nanogel system induced the production of H2O2. Meanwhile, following laser irradiation, NHS-BODIPY-Br effectively converted H2O2 to 1O2, which resulted in the remarkably reduced cancer cell survival. The therapeutic effect implied that the nanogel system is a potential platform for combination chemotherapy with PDT [134]."

Unlike the directed induction of apoptosis or autophagy by the cytotoxic drugs, vaccine adjuvants or immunomodulators typically trigger antitumor immunity by regulating the tumor microenvironment [137–139]. However, the limitations of tumor immunotherapy include the high cost of therapy, the difficulty of sustained systematic immunity, and low patient response. The application of nanomedicine combined with immunotherapy is considered to be a promising, safe, and efficacious tumor treatment strategy [140]. In this study, the modified cyclodextrin was combined with chitosan derivates to form the pH-sensitive nanogels for paclitaxel (PTX) loading. Then, the PTX-load NG was further coated by an erythrocyte membrane with interleukin-2 (IL-2) binding to construct the NRP+I nanoplatform for combinatorial immunotherapy. With the prolonged circulation and responsive drug release properties, the antitumor performance of NRP+I in the melanoma model was superior to that of free drugs or monotreatment. With co-delivery of PTX and IL-2 to the tumor region, the low-dosage of PTX release triggered the calreticulin (CRT) exposure on tumor cells and further induced the infiltration of CD8+ T cell into tumor tissue. Furthermore, IL-2 cytokine stripped from the membrane of NRP+I led to the activation of intratumoral cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in the tumor microenvironment, which resulted in the synergistic effect of chemo-immunotherapy (Figure 11) [141].Pharmaceutics 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 25\n6. Conclusion\nRecently, nanogel-based nanoplatforms have become a tremendously promising system of drug delivery. In this work, the preparation, characterization, properties and biomedical applications of nanogels are reviewed in detail. Nanogels constructed by chemical crosslinking or physical selfassembly exhibit the ability to encapsulate hydrophilic or hydrophobic therapeutics, including but not limited to small-molecule compounds, proteins, DNA/RNA sequences, and even ultrasmall nanoparticles. The nanosized nature of the carriers endows them with a specific surface area and inner space, increasing the stability of loaded drugs and prolonging their circulation time in biological systems. Reactions or the cleavage of chemical bonds in the structure of nanogels have been shown to trigger the controlled or sustained drug release. Through the design of specific chemical structures and different methods of production, nanogels can realize diverse responsiveness (temperature-sensitive, pH-sensitive and redox-sensitive) and enable the stimuli-responsive release of drugs in the microenvironments of various diseases. To improve therapeutic outcomes and increase the precision of therapy, nanogels can be modified by specific ligands to achieve active targeting. The targeting ligand modification of nanogels, such as FA, cRGD, and STn antigen, can further enhance drug accumulation in disease sites. Moreover, biomembrane-camouflaged nanogels exhibit additional intelligent targeted delivery features. Consequently, the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, as well as the combinational therapy strategy, result in the improved efficacy for disease treatments, by the introduction of a multifunctional nanogel-based DDS.\nFigure 11.

Consequently, the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, as well as the combinational therapy strategy, result in the improved efficacy for disease treatments, by the introduction of a multifunctional nanogel-based DDS. However, residual surfactants or unreacted monomers remaining in the nanogel formulation after synthesis are harmful substances with adverse effects in biomedicine. Physically linked nanogels might be more appropriate for drug formulation; however, the noncovalent bonds of physically linked nanogels are unstable, which might lead to premature leakage during circulation. Meanwhile, as a drug carrier, the drug-loading capacity and controlled drug release behavior of nanogels need to be further improved, especially for the release of certain drugs at large doses with continuous administration. In addition, the biosafety and in vivo degradation of nanogels still need exhaustive investigation because the components of nanogels are artificial polymeric materials\nAuthor Contributions: Q.Y. conceived and structured of this review; Y.Y., B.H. and Q.Y. wrote the draft; X.Y. and L.C. did literature search for this work; H.G. provided useful suggestions and revised the draft of review; Q.Y. revised the draft of review.

    "abstractText" : "Nanogel-based nanoplatforms have become a tremendously promising system of drug delivery. Nanogels constructed by chemical crosslinking or physical self-assembly exhibit the ability to encapsulate hydrophilic or hydrophobic therapeutics, including but not limited to small-molecule compounds and proteins, DNA/RNA sequences, and even ultrasmall nanoparticles, within their 3D polymer network. The nanosized nature of the carriers endows them with a specific surface area and inner space, increasing the stability of loaded drugs and prolonging their circulation time. Reactions or the cleavage of chemical bonds in the structure of drug-loaded nanogels have been shown to trigger the controlled or sustained drug release. Through the design of specific chemical structures and different methods of production, nanogels can realize diverse responsiveness (temperature-sensitive, pH-sensitive and redox-sensitive), and enable the stimuli-responsive release of drugs in the microenvironments of various diseases. To improve therapeutic outcomes and increase the precision of therapy, nanogels can be modified by specific ligands to achieve active targeting and enhance the drug accumulation in disease sites. Moreover, the biomembrane-camouflaged nanogels exhibit additional intelligent targeted delivery features. Consequently, the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, as well as the combinational therapy strategy, result in the improved efficacy of disease treatments, though the introduction of a multifunctional nanogel-based drug delivery system.",
