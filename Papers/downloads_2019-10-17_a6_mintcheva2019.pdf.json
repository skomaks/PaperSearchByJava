      "text" : "Semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate unique optical, electronic, photoluminescence, and photocatalytic properties that differ from those of their bulk counterparts because many of these properties are size-dependent at the nanoscale. Such a dependence arises from the change in the surface-to-volume ratio, and as a result of the quantum confinement effect at small sizes. The latter effect consists of the widening of the HOMO-LUMO gap with size reduction, which causes an increase in energy band gap and blue shift of the excitonic absorption peak of NPs [1,2]. The resulting changes in optical and photocatalytic properties were widely investigated for many semiconductors, including compounds of the II-VI class, i.e., those with Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ as cations and O2−, S2−, Se2−, and Te2− as anions. As typical examples, the photocatalytic activities of ZnO, ZnS, and CdS\nMaterials 2019, 12, 3313; doi:10.3390/ma12203313 www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2019, 12, 3313 2 of 10\nnanomaterials draw a lot of attention owing to their environmental and energy-related applications, such as degradation of organic pollutants, hydrogen production, catalytic CO2 conversion, etc. [3–6]. Nanoparticles of metal sulfides, such as CdS and ZnS, are believed to be effective photocatalysts due to their proper band gaps, the rapid formation of electron-hole pairs, and the enhanced adsorption of target molecules on the surface [5,6]. The photocatalytic performance of metal sulfides can be improved through more efficient light absorption and the reduction of hole-electron recombination—both properties being dependent on the band gap energy and crystal structure of the material. In turn, the band gap of the nanomaterial is known to be influenced not only by its particle size, but also by its composition, morphology, and structural defects. Therefore, the photocatalytic properties of semiconductor NPs can be altered via different synthetic routes, aiming at products with well-controlled size, shape, and crystallinity. That is why various approaches have been developed so far to provide metal sulfides with specific characteristics and properties [5,6], including controlled precipitation in the presence of thiourea [7,8] or sodium sulfide [9], hydrothermal reduction of sulfur [10], etc. There are also chemical methods that rely on the thermal decomposition of molecular precursors that give rise to metal sulfide NPs. Many metal complexes with S-containing molecules as ligands, such as dithiocarbamate [11–13], thiosemicarbazone [14,15], thiobenzoates [16], glutathione [17], and thiourea [18], were applied for the preparation of various metal sulfide NPs with tunable morphology and optical properties. Metal xanthates (dithiocarbonates) are also used as single precursors for solvothermal processes [19,20], the hot-injection method [21], thermolysis in dimethylfolmamide [22,23], etc. Singhal et al. reported the formation of palladium sulfide from the thermal decomposition of square-planar Pd(II) xanthate complexes in dioctyl ether [24]. Efrima et al. used long-chain alkyl xanthates (hexadecyl xanthate) as a precursor for metal sulfides and achieved a controllable NP size at a variety of temperatures and xanthate concentrations [25]. The same group found that electron-donating solvents, such as alkylamines, permitted the lowering of the reaction temperature and formed NPs under mild conditions [26]. Similarly, other authors used ethylene diamine as a capping and coordinating agent to favor the formation of sulfide NPs [19,20]. The existing synthetic methods are often reported to require high medium temperatures (and thus special equipment) [20,21], to use toxic organic solvents and/or surfactants [22–26], and to take a relatively long reaction time [19]. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new method for preparing CdS and ZnS nanomaterials that has significant advantages over previously developed approaches: (1) low reaction temperature and easy handling of the process, (2) surfactant-free route that produces minimum waste chemicals, (3) good yield and production rate of both CdS and ZnS NPs with distinctive morphology and photocatalytic performance. In this paper, we report the easy synthesis of metal sulfide (CdS and ZnS) NPs from xanthate as a sulfur source without the use of any organic solvents or surfactants. The reaction is carried out under mild conditions (60–80 ◦C) and in a basic water medium where metal xanthates decompose to sulfide ions and the formed metal sulfides crystallize into a low-temperature cubic phase. Both produced materials are shown to be nano-sized, with average particle sizes around 7.0 and 4.2 nm (for CdS and ZnS, respectively), and demonstrate photocatalytic activity towards methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation."

The effect of the organic group in xanthate on the process kinetics and structure of the obtained product was also investigated, with the results being reported elsewhere [27]. Ethylxanthate and amylxanthate were found to be the most suitable sulfur precursors to produce single-phase ZnS NPs, while the use of butyl- and hexylxanthates was associated with the formation of side products, and required a longer reaction time and a higher temperature for the decomposition\nMaterials 2019, 12, 3313 3 of 10\nof xanthate and the formation of metal sulfide.

Photocatalytic Tests\nPhotodegradation of MB under visible-light irradiation in the presence of CdS (or ZnS) NPs (as a suspension) was carried out for a period of 3 h. In order to reach adsorption‒desorption equilibrium of MB on the NP surface, a dark phase (indicated in Figure 5 with a dashed line) was first applied for 30 min, during which a slight decrease in MB concentration was observed due to the adsorption of the dye on the catalyst’s surface.

As seen in Figure 5, after 3 h, the dispersion with CdS NPs lost ~72% of its MB and the ZnS NPs lost ~61% of MB, whereas in the blank sample less than 13% of MB decolorized. It should be noted that, normally, a direct comparison between two different nanomaterials (with different particle sizes and chemical composition) is difficult, at least because their active surface exposed to the dye and the number of active surface sites are different. In this study, for simplicity we used equal masses of catalysts (10 mg of nanomaterial in 100 mL of aqueous MB with concentration 8 × 10−6 mol/dm3, which corresponds to 8 × 10−7 mol of MB per 10 mg of catalyst). Therefore, considering that the molar mass of CdS is larger than that of ZnS, the amount of CdS material (in mol) was smaller. Nevertheless, it is clearly seen in Figure 5 that CdS NPs decayed the MB molecules faster and more efficiently than their ZnS counterparts. Therefore, it is obvious that, of the two sulfide nanomaterials prepared in this work, the sample based on CdS demonstrated higher photocatalytic activity.\nFigure 5. Photocatalytic activity of CdS and ZnS towards MB degradation in aqueous solution. Decay of MB caused by ZnS (red) and CdS (black line) is clearly observed over time.\nThe degradation of MB catalyzed by semiconductor materials is known to be a first-order reaction with respect to MB, and the rate is proportional to the concentration of MB (rate = k [MB]) [38,39]. Therefore, the rate constant, k, can be determined as a slope of ln(C/Co) plotted against time, as seen in Figure 6. For room temperature (300 K), the estimated rate constants of CdS- and ZnScatalyzed reactions were found to be kCdS = 6.8 × 10−3 min−1 and kZnS = 4.9 × 10−3 min−1, respectively. Both values are in good agreement with those previously reported for similar photocatalysts by others [40]. It is worth noting that our nanomaterials demonstrated 2–4-fold higher rate constants and better degradation efficiency than CdS and ZnS obtained by other methods and tested under similar conditions [40]. The high photocatalytic performance of both metal sulfides prepared through the xanthate-mediated method can be explained by the formation of NPs enriched with sulfur vacancies\nFigure 5.

Such vacancies are believed to promote visible light absorption, which is observed as a tail above 400 nm (ZnS) and 500 nm (CdS) in the absorbance spectra of both materials (Figure 4a,b). They can also entrap photogenerated electrons and restrain the electron-hole recombination, thus increasing the photocatalytic activity of such nanomaterials. As mentioned above, the band gap for CdS is 3.1 eV, which is lower than that of ZnS (4.0 eV). Therefore, CdS NPs need lower energy to excite their electrons from valence to conductive band and to generate exciton electron-hole pairs. As a result, such NPs could absorb the visible light used for irradiation more efficiently, which in turn led to their higher photocatalytic activity.

Such reaction conditions are shown to ensure the formation of nanoparticles with a cubic crystal structure, small particle sizes, narrow size distribution, and sulfur vacancies for both metal sulfides. The newly prepared nanomaterials revealed high photocatalytic performance, efficiently decaying methylene blue in an aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation. This property results from the unique structure of the novel xanthate-mediated nanomaterials, with numerous structural defects that reduce the hole‒electron recombination rate and thus assist in the formation of oxidizing species that react with organic molecules. Even though the CdS nanoparticles had larger sizes (7.0 nm on average), they outperformed their ZnS counterparts (with average size 4.2 nm) as photocatalyst. This is explained by the smaller band gap found for the CdS nanomaterial, which could absorb visible light more efficiently.\nAuthor Contributions: N.M. and G.G. designed and carried out the experiments; N.M., M.P., and W.W. conducted most of the analyses.

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we report a new, simple method for the synthesis of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles (NPs) prepared in a basic aqueous medium using metal xanthate as the sulfur source. The structure, morphology, size distribution, optical band gap, and photocatalytic properties of the newly obtained nanomaterials were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that both CdS and ZnS crystallized in cubic phase and formed NPs with average sizes of 7.0 and 4.2 nm for CdS and ZnS, respectively. A blue shift of UV-Vis absorbance band and higher energy band gap values were observed for both materials in comparison with their bulk counterparts, which is in accordance with the quantum confinement effect. The as-prepared nanomaterials were tested in visible-light driven photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue (MB). After irradiation for 180 min, the degradation rate of MB with a concentration of 8 × 10−6 mol/L mixed with a photocatalyst (CdS or ZnS, both 10 mg in 100 mL solution of MB) was found to be 72% and 61%, respectively. The CdS NPs showed better photocatalytic activity than ZnS, which could be explained by their lower energy band gap and thus the ability to absorb light more efficiently when activated by visible-light irradiation.",
