Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coatings on Mg alloys provide mild corrosion protection owing to their porous structure. Hence, in this study a dense Mg(OH)2 film was fabricated on MAO-coated Mg alloy AZ31 in an alkaline electrolyte containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA2Na) to reinforce the protection. Surface morphology, chemical composition and growth process of the MAO/Mg(OH)2 hybrid coating were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. Corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated via potentiodynamic polarization curves and hydrogen evolution tests. Results manifested that the Mg(OH)2 coating possesses a porous nano-sized structure and completely seals the micro-pores and micro-cracks of the MAO coating. The intermetallic compound of AlMn phase in the substrate plays a key role in the growth of Mg(OH)2 film. The current density of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating decreases three orders of magnitude in comparison with that of bare substrate, indicating excellent corrosion resistance. The Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating is beneficial to the formation of calcium phosphate corrosion products on the surface of Mg alloy AZ31, demonstrating a great promise for orthopaedic applications.\ny Els © 2019 Published b\n. Introduction\nMagnesium (Mg) and its alloys have become a material of hoice for temporary-bone implants owing to their low density, omparative elastic modulus to that of natural bone and excelent biocompatibility [1–3]. However, electrochemically active Mg lloys are vulnerable to corrosion in chlorine-ion-bearing soluions, such as human body fluid, which thus limits their clinical pplications [4–8]. A large variety of feasible surface-modification trategies, such as chemical conversion coatings [9–11], micro-arc xidation (MAO) [12–15], layered double hydroxides (LDH) [16,17]\n∗ Corresponding author at: College of Materials Science and Engineering, Shanong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China.\nE-mail address: rczeng@foxmail.com (R.-C.

In this regard, MAO coatings outperform their competitors, attributed to their high hardness, highly metallurgical adhesion to substrate, and superior corrosion protection over a short time period. However, such protection degrades greatly with time owing to the porous nature of MAO coatings as a result of the electric sparks generated in the MAO processing. Particularly, open pores in MAO coatings lead to accumulation of corrosive media, and provide pathways for the ingress of corrosive ingredients into the interface of MAO/substrate, which makes a short in-service life of the MAO-coated Mg components [22,23].\nIn addition, sound pore-sealing techniques have been attempted over the past decades to address the Achilles heel of MAO coating systems. The mainstream procedures can be categorized into single or multiple steps. Time- and cost-effective one-step options gen-\nMaterials Science & Technology.\nrocess\ne p i r a e t\nb a s i [ c p o p i M r m e f M a t c p c v A m o w e a M\ni C C t\nrally involve a self-sealing procedure of MAO with ceramic oxide articles (e.g. SiO2 and TiO2) in electrolyte [24–26] with low sealng efficiency and lack of generic procedures applicable for a broad ange of MAO coatings. For instance, Song et al. [26] have prepared\nself-sealing MAO coating on Mg alloy AM60 in a fluorotitanate lectrolyte, and found that fluoride ions have a great influence on he film compactness.\nIn contrast, the time-consuming two-step methods include oth MAO and post-sealing process. So far, a number of two-step pproaches have been employed for sealing pores in MAO coatings, uch as polymer coatings (i.e., PLLA, chitosan and silane) [27–30], norganic fillers [31,32], and boiling water or alkaline treatment 33–36]. Our previous investigations reveal that for MAO/PLLA omposite coatings on Mg-Li-Ca-(Y) alloys, the outer PLLA coating eels off due to its physical swelling and preferential corrosion f the substrate alloy [27,37]. Compared with the mechanical or hysical combination between organic coating and MAO coating, n-situ growth of Mg or titanium hydroxide coatings on top of AO coatings with high adhesion to Mg or Ti alloys can avoid the isks of the coating fracture. The most common post-treatment ethod is conducted with boiling water or alkaline treatment. Cui t al. [28] attempted an alkaline post-treatment using 1 M NaOH ollowed by surface salinization to effectively seal the pores of the\nAO coating on Mg alloy AZ31. Han et al. [36] have employed lkali treated in 5 M NaOH aqueous solution at 60 ◦C for 24 h. And he specimens were heated at 600 ◦C for 1 h and then furnace ooled. Consequently, a porous network structure Mg(OH)2 was repared on Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn alloy. Narayanan et al. [38] fabriated a Mg(OH)2 coating with a fine spherical or globular feature ia an alkaline post-treatment using 3 M NaOH at 60 ◦C for 1 h. lthough alkali treatments in a single alkaline solution for aboveentioned processes have been used to prepare Mg(OH)2 coatings n MAO surfaces, only a portion of micro-pores or micro-cracks ere covered. Nevertheless, addition of a complexing agent, e.g., thylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na-EDTA), into an lkaline solution to promote the growth of Mg(OH)2 coating on AO coating has scarcely been reported. Na-EDTA [39,40] is a hexadentate (s̈ix-teeth)̈ ligand and chelatng agent with a strong ability to sequester metal ions such as a2+ and Mg2+. Tang et al. [41] fabricated a hydroxyapatite (HA, a10(PO4)6(OH)2) micro-flower coating on MAO surface in a soluion (300 mmol/L Ca-EDTA and 200 mmol/L KH2PO4) at 80 ◦C for 6 h.\nof Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating.\nThe HA micro-flowers aggregate on the MAO surface with a size of 15–20 m and a thickness of approximately 15 m. But the corrosion current density (icorr) is only decreased one order of magnitude from 8.09 × 10−6 A/cm2 of bare substrate to 4.21 × 10−7 A/cm2. Kim et al. [34] prepared a Mg(OH)2 and HA hydride coating on MAO coating via hydrothermal treatment using 0.1 M Ca-EDTA and 0.5 M NaOH solution at 90 ◦C for different time frames (6, 12, 24, and 48 h). The surface has a multiple layer of a complex network structure. The coating thickness increases with increasing treatment time. And the coating treated after 24 h has the best corrosion resistance. The corrosion current density for composite coating decreases two orders of magnitude to 1.95 × 10-7 A/cm2. The results show that alkaline treatment time has a direct impact on corrosion resistance.\nMoreover, the compactness and roughness of chemical conversion coatings and MAO coatings on Mg alloys is severely affected by intermetallic compounds or second phases (e.g. AlMn and Mg2Ca) [42]. This study aims to fabricate a biocompatible nano-structured Mg(OH)2 coating on MAO coating with improved corrosion resistance through an environmentally-friendly treatment, i.e. low treatment temperature, and short treatment time, and to understand the formation mechanism of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating. Especially, attention is paid on the influence of intermetallic compounds AlMn and EDTA as well as pore-sealing process of the Mg(OH)2 coatings on MAO coating.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Preparation of MAO coatings\nMg alloy AZ31 specimens with dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm × 5 mm were used as substrate material. The substrates were ground with SiC sand papers progressively to 1500-grit finish and cleaned with de-ionized (DI) water, ethanol for 5 min at room temperature and then dried with warm air for preparation of MAO coatings. The pre-treated specimens were anodized using a house-made MAO equipment. The device is consisted of a power supply unit controlled by a single chip micyoco, a stainless-steel barrel as cathode, and a stirring and cooling system. MAO coatings were fabricated with 1 kW AC power supply with a duty cycle of 50%, a constant current of 0.3 A and a frequency of 100 Hz for 5 min. The electrolyte contained 10 g L−1 of NaOH and\nF (d) ele c\n8 s\n2\nL a d i\n2\ne 4 e e i C t ( a\n2\nc\nig. 2.

After coating preparation, amples were cleaned with DI water and dried using warm air.\n.2. Preparation of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating\nMAO samples were immersed in a solution consisting of 40 g −1 of NaOH and 50 g L−1 of EDTA-2Na (Solution B) with pH 13.6 t 60 ◦C for 1 h. Then, the samples were cleaned with DI water and ried at 80 ◦C for 30 min. The preparation process is schematically llustrated in Fig. 1.\n.3. Characterization of the coatings\nSurface morphology of the coatings was observed using fieldmission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 50, USA); and elemental composition was detected with equipped nergy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The chemical bonds xisting in the coatings were characterized via a Fourier transform nfrared spectrophotometer (FTIR, Nicolet 380, Thermo Electron orporation, USA). Crystallographic microstructure of the alloy and he coatings was analyzed by means of an X-ray diffractometer XRD, Rigaku D/MAX2500PC, Japan) with a Cu target ( = 0.154 nm) t a scanning rate of 8◦/min in the 2 range from 5◦ to 80◦.\n.4. Corrosion characterization\nCorrosion resistance of the Mg alloy substrate and various oatings was evaluated by electrochemical polarization and hydro-\nment compositions and the cross-section of (e) MAO coating, (f) Mg(OH)2-MAO\ngen evolution measurements. Potentiodynamic polarization curves were recorded through an electrochemical analyzer (PAR Model 2273, Princeton, USA). A three-electrode cell set-up was applied, consisting of the prepared sample as working electrode and a platinum sheet as counter and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. All the electrochemical experiments were performed in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), containing 8.0 g/L NaCl, 1.0 g/L C6H6O6 (Glucose), 0.35 g/L NaHCO3, 0.4 g/L KCl, 0.14 g/L CaCl2, 0.1 g/L MgCl2·6H2O, 0.06 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.06 g/L KH2PO4 and 0.06 g/L Na2HPO4·12H2O at room temperature. Prior to potentiodynamic polarization tests, a stable open-circuit potential (OCP) was established within 600 s. The polarization curves were recorded with a sweep rate of 2 mV/s. The hydrogen evolution was tested by placing the samples with full surfaces exposed into in HBSS at 37.5 ± 0.1 ◦C under an inverted funnel connected to a graduated burette and measuring the solution level in the burette intermittently for 156 h [18,44].\n3. Results\n3.1. Surface analysis\nFig. 2 shows SEM images and EDS spectra of the MAO coating and Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating. The MAO coating (Fig. 2(a)) exhibits a typical morphology with a variety of micro-pores and micro-cracks.

As mentioned above [28,36,38], the prepaation of Mg(OH)2 in a single alkaline solution does not completely eal the pores of MAO surface. So it is confirmed that EDTA-2Na romoted the growth of Mg(OH)2, and increased the content of g(OH)2 in the study. EDS analysis (Fig. 2(d)) shows that the MAO coating predomiantly contains O, Mg and P. Particularly, P element was originated rom the electrolyte, indicating that phytic acid was involved in he MAO process. It is noted that the composite coating includes\nerely O and Mg elements. The absence of P element indicates hat the MAO coating was completely covered by a layer of\ng(OH)2. Cross-sectional morphology of MAO coating and composite oating (Fig. 2(e) and (f)) reveals that the thickness of both coatings s approximately 3 m. And no obvious Mg(OH)2 layer was found n Fig. 2(f), indicating that the Mg(OH)2 layer is extremely thin and nterlocked with the MAO coating. Differing from the work of Tang t al. [41] and Kim et al. [34], the surface in this study exhibits a ore refined structure in a nano-sized scale and Mg(OH)2 coating s ultrathin. XRD patterns of Mg alloy AZ31 substrate, MAO and Mg(OH)2-\nwith phosphate are seen in Fig. 3. The peaks of Mg(OH)2 (Fig. 3(c)) indicates the growth of Mg(OH)2 coating.\nFig. 4 shows FTIR spectra of (a) MAO and (b) Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coatings. The Mg-O peak (Fig. 4(a)) at 451 cm−1 proves the formation of MgO in the MAO coating. And the adsorption peak at 3421 cm−1 in Fig. 4(b) is −OH groups, confirming the existence of Mg(OH)2 in the composite coating. This finding is in agreement with the results of XRD pattern in Fig. 3.\n3.2. Corrosion behavior\nFig. 5(a) illustrates potentiodynamic polarization curves of bare Mg alloy AZ31 substrate, MAO coating and Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coatings in HBSS and the corresponding parameters (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). Corrosion potential (Ecorr) mainly describes the thermodynamic property of metals; and corrosion resistance is evaluated by corrosion current density (icorr). Compared to MAO coating, Ecorr of the Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating increases from −1.64 to −1.36 VSCE, demonstrating that the thermal stability of the composite coating is improved. And Ecorr of the MAO coating is lower than that of the substrate. This result will be discussed in detail in the discussion section.\nCorrosion rate, icorr of the MAO coating decreases two orders of magnitude from 5.97 × 10−5 A/cm2 of bare substrate to 3.72 × 10−7 A/cm . Moreover, icorr of the Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating decreases one order of magnitude from 3.72 × 10−7 to 5.69 × 10−8 A/cm2 in comparison to the MAO coating, implying that the Mg(OH)2 coating further improves corrosion resistance of the MAO\nbstrate, (II) MAO coating and (III) Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating in HBSS.\n1092 C.-Y.

[34], a better or similar corrosion resistant ultrathin coating as yielded herein in a shorter treatment time frame at a lower reatment temperature. Hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of (a) bare Mg alloy AZ31 subtrate, (b) MAO and (c) Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coatings in HBSS or 156 h is shown in Fig. 6. During the first (I) stage, HER increases rstly and then decreases, suggesting the formation of corrosion roducts Mg(OH)2 on the alloy surface. During the second (II) eriod, HER starts to increase, showing the dissolution and delamnation of the corrosion products film resulting in exposing a fresh urface. And HER of the composite coating is higher due to the act that the Mg(OH)2 coating dissolved more easily than MgO in BSS due to the transformation of Mg(OH)2 into MgCl2 [45,46]. uring the third (III) stage, HER of the substrate alloy tended to ecrease slowly, indicating the formation of a new corrosion prodcts (Mg(OH)2) film. And HER of the Mg(OH)2-MAO composite oating is the smallest, indicating that more corrosion products (Ca-\ncompounds) were formed. A subsequent discussion will disclose he chemical composition of the corrosion products. In general, HER f the composite coating is lower than that of the MAO coating. In ther words, corrosion resistance of the composite coating was beter than that of its MAO coating. This finding is in accordance with he results of the potentiodynamic polarization curves.\n. Discussion\n.1. Influence of intermetallic compounds\nIn our previous studies, the presence of the second phases or ntermetallic compounds in the substrate alloy was found to have n important effect on the formation of MAO and chemical converion coatings. For example, Mg2Ca phases shift the formation and orrosion mechanisms of MAO coating on Mg-Li-Ca alloy [48]. And he AlMn phase in Mg alloys AZ31 and AM30 acts as initiator for the ormation of a Ca-doped zinc phosphate coating [42,47]. Size and istribution of the AlMn particles affect the surface morphology, oughness and corrosion resistance.\nIt is proposed that AlMn phase also has a critical influence on the ormation of Mg(OH)2 coating. In order to understand the formation rocess of Mg(OH)2 coating, Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating was abricated in Solution B for different time lengths. Fig. 7 shows SEM mages of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coatings after various soaking ime. Figs. 8 and 9 display atomic ratios and mapping images of coresponding elements: O, Mg, P, Al and Mn. The presence of higher oncentration of Al and Mn elements designates AlMn phase (i.e.,\n& Technology 35 (2019) 1088–1098\nAl8Mn5 and AlMn) in the MAO coating [42,47]. It is noteworthy noting from Fig. 9 that more Mg(OH)2 precipitates around the AlMn phases.\nThe defects or through-pores between the interfaces of AlMn/MAO coating offer a larger possibility of ingress of the solution into the interfaces of MAO/Mg substrate. In the initial immersion stage for 10 s (Fig. 7(a)–(c)), small Mg(OH)2 crystals preferentially formed around the AlMn phases. AlMn phase with a higher potential acts as the cathode; and -Mg with a lower potential acts as the anode [27,42]. This result led to the dissolution of -Mg and the formation of Mg(OH)2.\nAnd the anode reaction followed as:\nMg → Mg2+ + 2e− (1) Cathodic reaction:\n2H2O+2e −→2OH− + H2↑ (2)\nOverall reaction:\nMg+2H2O → Mg(OH)2 + H2↑ (3) With increasing time, the Mg(OH)2 precipitates around the AlMn phase gradually grew like a seed germination. And Fig. 7(j)–(l) shows that Mg(OH)2 already has a three-dimensional porous network structure. It is worth noting that Mg(OH)2 is centered on the AlMn phase and gradually diffuses outward. It indicates that the Mg2+ ions near the anode moved outwards onto the surface through the through pores of MAO coating, trapped by EDTA, and concentrated on the AlMn phase. The results promoted the growth of Mg(OH)2 above and around the AlMn phase.\nContemporary, MAO coating was also gradually changed into Mg(OH)2. The reaction is as follows:\nMgO+H2O → Mg(OH)2 (4) As seen in Fig. 2(b), the entire MAO coating is completely covered by porous network layers of Mg(OH)2. Based on the previous discussion, a model is proposed to explain the formation of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating (Fig. 10). Briefly, the porous network layer of Mg(OH)2 experienced three steps of growth: (a) dissolution of Mg, movement of Mg2+, and absorption of EDTA; (b) nucleation of Mg(OH)2 and transformation of MgO in MAO coating into Mg(OH)2; and (c) growth of Mg(OH)2. It can also be seen that Mg(OH)2 is also formed at the micro-pores and micro-cracks on MAO surface. Hence, it is speculated that the Mg(OH)2 in these sites can grow faster. This is similar to the case of cross-linking of polymer, to some degree.\n4.2. Influence of EDTA\nEDTA molecules play a vital role in the nucleation and growth of Mg(OH)2 [28,36,38], attributed to the excellent complexing ability to Mg2+. EDTA is a hexadentate (s̈ix-toothed)̈ ligand and chelating agent, i.e., its ability to sequester metal ions such as Mg2+. Usually, EDTA has seven different forms: H6Y2+, H5Y+, H4Y, H3Y−, H2Y2−, HY3− and Y4− in aqueous solutions with different pH values [39,40]. The anion Y4− is the ligand species with the strongest complexability. The greater the concentration of Y4− ions, the more stable the complex. When the pH value of solution is greater than 10, the presence of species Y4− will predominate [39]. In this experiment, the pH value of solution B is about 13.6. Thus, EDTA is possible present in the form of HY3− and Y4−. If EDTA is complexed with Mg2+, it must occur in the early stages of dissolution of -Mg, because Mg substrate surface and solution have more Mg2+ at this time.\nTo further understand the role of EDTA, N element was detected for samples immersed in Solution B for 10 s and 1 h through Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The spectra of the samples\nF 10 s (a\ni t a t r g N w l\nig. 7.

After he sample of immersing in Solution B for 10 s, N 1s spectra can be esolved into two peaks: main peak at 400.1 eV attributed to N C\nroup; and a peak at 397.3 eV that may be related to the presence of\nH group. The results reveal that EDTA is absorbed and chelated ith Mg2+ ions on the surface in the initial stage, and form the inner\nayer of Mg(OH)2. The specific reaction is as follows:\n–c), 30 s (d–f), 1 min (g–i), 5 min (j–l), 10 min (m–o), 20 min (p–r) and 30 min (s–u).\nMg2+ + Y4- → MgY2- (5)\nHowever, after immersing in Solution B for 1 h, the peak of N 1s diminished. This result indicates that the Mg(OH)2 coating covered the inner layer of MgY2−. And EDTA loses its effect in the late stage of coating growth. Therefore, only in the initial stage of coating growth, EDTA plays an important role in promoting the nucleation of Mg(OH)2.\nF s\n4\ne\ning secondary protection. Moreover, it was found that a part of the\nig. 11. XPS spectra of the samples immersed in solution B for 10 s and 1 h: (a) urvey and (b) high dissolution curves of N 1s.\n.3. Corrosion mechanism\nWhen the open circuit potential (OCP) between two metals xceeds 50 mV/SCE, a micro-couple coupling effect is generated to\nincrease the probability of galvanic corrosion [49–51]. The metal with lower OCP is subject to corrosion; whereas the other metal deserves a protection. Fig. 12 displays that the initial potential difference between the MAO coating and the AZ31 substrate is 240 mVSCE, far exceeding 50 mVSCE, which may lead to galvanic corrosion in the interface of MAO/Mg substrate via through pores or micro-cracks of the MAO coating. It is not surprised that the OCP of the Mg substrate slowly increased due to the formation of Mg(OH)2; whilst the OCP of the MAO coating gradually decreased from the initial 240 to 10 mVSCE, indicating that the degradation of MAO coating. The increase in OCP for Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating implies the formation of Ca-P precipitates (Fig. 13).\nFig. 13 illustrates the SEM images of the (a) bare Mg alloy AZ31 substrate, (b) MAO coating and (c) composite coating and (d) the corresponding element compositions in HBSS after an immersion of 156 h. It is clear that a dry riverbed corrosion morphology can be observed on the surfaces of the bare AZ31 substrate (Fig. 13(a)), MAO coating (Fig. 13(b)) and Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating (Fig. 13(c)). From the inset images, whether it is an MAO coating or a composite coating, the surface micro-pores were filled with corrosion products (i.e. Ca-P compounds), effectively provid-\nMg(OH)2 was dissolved, which corresponds to the third (III) stages of immersion (Fig. 6). The corresponding element compositions in HBSS after 156 h immersion are presented in Fig. 13(d). From the\nF g and\ni c o r 1\nd t t [ c s H f t s a t e\nc\nig. 14. (a) XRD patterns and (b) FTIR spectra of (I) AZ31 substrate, (II) MAO coatin\nmage, the content of Ca and P on the surface of Mg(OH)2-MAO omposite coating is by far the highest in comparison with that f the bare AZ31 substrate and MAO coating. However, the atomic atio of calcium to phosphorus is only 0.83, which is far less than .67 for HA due to the presence of P in the MAO coating.\nIn order to further determine the corrosion products, Fig. 14 isplays (a) XRD patterns and (b) FTIR spectra of all samples after he hydrogen evolution tests in HBSS. It can be seen from Fig. 14a hat all sample surfaces have weak diffraction peaks of Mg(OH)2 44,19,52,53]. It is worth noting that Mg(OH)2-MAO composite oating has a distinct characteristic peak at 28◦ compared to other amples, which is ascribed to HA phase. It is noted that the Ca/P in A is 1.67, which is higher than the EDS result (0.83). But it is indeed ound that the content of Ca increased with increasing P concentraion (Fig. 13(d)). Hence, it is proved that a porous Mg(OH)2 network tructure is more favorable for inducing the formation of calcium nd phosphorus products. And the adsorption peaks for FTIR specra at 1056 cm−1 in Fig. 14(b) is PO43- groups, further confirming xistence of the Ca-P precipitates or HA.\nFig. 15 illustrates the corrosion mechanism of Mg(OH)2-MAO omposite films in HBSS. The composite coatings immersed in HBSS\n(III) Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating after the hydrogen evolution tests in HBSS.\nsolution containing Cl−, H2PO4− and Ca2+ ions, H2O and EDTA as well (Fig. 15(a)). On one hand, the Mg(OH)2-MAO coating gradually dissolved and cracks appeared slowly. On the other hand, H2O molecules and chloride ions (Fig. 15(b)) penetrated through Mg(OH)2 layer and pores or micro-cracks of MAO coating into the interface of MAO layer and the Mg substrate, leading to chemical corrosion of -Mg substrate surrounding the AlMn phases. Basically, AlMn phase in Mg alloy AZ31 with a higher potential acts the cathode; whereas the neighboring -Mg matrix becomes the anode, and is susceptible to corrosion [4,44]. Once H2O molecules reached the interface of the MAO/Mg substrate, the -Mg matrix near AlMn phase was preferentially corroded and the reactions follow as Eqs. (1)–(4). And Mg(OH)2 reacted with Cl- formed soluble MgCl2 (Fig. 15(c)), as shown in Eq. (6) [46].\nMg(OH)2 + 2Cl−→MgCl2 + 2OH− (6)\nAt the same time, in the weakly alkaline HBSS, the dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4−) ions converted into hydrogen phosphate\n( r\nH\nH\nm p o\n1\n5\n(\n(\n(\nA\nd R\nR\n[ [ [\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [ [\n[\n[\n[ [ [\n[ [\n[ [\n[\nHPO42-), then into phosphate (PO43-) [54–56] (Fig. 15(d)). These eactions follow as:\n2PO − 4 + OH−→HPO2-4 + H2O (7)\nPO2-4 + OH−→PO3-4 + H2O (8) Finally, Ca2+ ions reacted with PO43− ions, resulted in the foration of HA, which was deposited on the coating surface, and rovided protection for the substrate in HBSS solution. The reaction beys:\n0Ca2+ + 6PO3-4 + 2OH−→Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (9)\n. Conclusions\n1) A nano-sized porous network structure ultra-thin Mg(OH)2 coating was fabricated on MAO surface via a water bath method and EDTA-2Na promoted the nucleation and growth of Mg(OH)2. The initiation sites of the Mg(OH)2 film neighbored at intermetallic compound AlMn phases. 2) Corrosion current density of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating decreased one and three orders of magnitude from those of its MAO coating and substrate, respectively. And Mg(OH)2MAO composite coating led to HA deposition and the lowest hydrogen evolution rate in HBSS after 156 h. Results indicate Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating had better corrosion resistance. 3) The formation and corrosion mechanism of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating was proposed. Mg(OH)2-MAO coating on Mg alloy AZ31 demonstrated a promise for clinical applications for degradable biomaterials.\ncknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Founation of China (Nos. 51571134 and 51601108) and the SDUST esearch Fund (No. 2014TDJH104).\neferences\n[1] L.Y.

    "abstractText" : "One of the major obstacles for the clinical use of biodegradable magnesium (Mg)-based materials is their high corrosion rate. Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coatings on Mg alloys provide mild corrosion protection owing to their porous structure. Hence, in this study a dense Mg(OH)2 film was fabricated on MAO-coated Mg alloy AZ31 in an alkaline electrolyte containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA2Na) to reinforce the protection. Surface morphology, chemical composition and growth process of the MAO/Mg(OH)2 hybrid coating were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. Corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated via potentiodynamic polarization curves and hydrogen evolution tests. Results manifested that the Mg(OH)2 coating possesses a porous nano-sized structure and completely seals the micro-pores and micro-cracks of the MAO coating. The intermetallic compound of AlMn phase in the substrate plays a key role in the growth of Mg(OH)2 film. The current density of Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating decreases three orders of magnitude in comparison with that of bare substrate, indicating excellent corrosion resistance. The Mg(OH)2-MAO composite coating is beneficial to the formation of calcium phosphate corrosion products on the surface of Mg alloy AZ31, demonstrating a great promise for orthopaedic applications. y Els © 2019 Published b",
