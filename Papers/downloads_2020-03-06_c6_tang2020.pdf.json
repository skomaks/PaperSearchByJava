      "text" : "As the main elements in the human body, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus are essential. Among them, phosphorus plays an indispensable role considering the following aspects: (1) it is one of the basic components of nucleic acids that make up genetic substances; (2) it is a necessary part of body fluid, regulation of acid-base balance, and energy metabolism; (3) it forms proteins, teeth, and bone.1 In the new century, almost all of the significant achievements in the fields of biology and biochemistry are closely related to compounds containing phosphorus and carbon, opening up a very attractive world for the application of phosphorus compounds. Inorganic phosphates have been used for medical purposes for a long time, such as antacid magnesium phosphate,2 aluminum phosphate gels,3 diuretics, and laxative sodium dihydrogen phosphate.4 There are more commonly used phosphate-containing drugs, such as analgesic codeine5 and the antimalarial drug chloroquine,6 because the phosphate can increase the water solubility of the drug and rarely interferes with the physiological pH.7,8 However, medicinal organophosphorus compounds have undergone a tortuous development process due to the rapid development of organophosphorus pesticides,9 resulting in concerns about \"toxic organic phosphorus.\" Fortunately, numerous organophosphorus drugs have been used in cancer treatments such as cyclophosphamide10,11 and pyrophosphoric acid mustard.12 This has brought great attention to developing more useful phosphorus-based agents in cancer treatments.\nWith the advancement of nanotechnology, plenty of phosphorus-based nanomaterials have been cultivated and widely applied to biomedical fields. Unlike traditional\nMatter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020 ª 2019 Elsevier Inc. 297\norganic molecules, nanomaterials have advantages such as high surface-to-volume ratio,13 ease of modification, and ample and excellent physicochemical properties. Currently, phosphorus-based nanomaterials mainly include phosphorus-containing dendrimer nanoplatforms,14–18 black phosphorus (BP) nanomaterials,19 metal phosphide nanoparticles,20–23 and metal phosphate nanoparticles.24–26 Generally, chemotherapy drugs can be loaded into or chemically conjugated to phosphoruscontaining dendrimer nanoplatforms, thus promoting the application of phosphorus-containing dendrimer nanoplatforms as nanocarriers. Moreover, since the appearance of graphene,27–29 numerous mono-element two-dimensional nanomaterials,30–34 especially BP nanosheets, have attracted great attention. The BP nanomaterials can be used not only as nanocarriers and tumor theranostics but also as biosensors, due to the unique two-dimensional structure and tunable bandgaps property.35 Also, the metal elements and semiconductor property of metal phosphide nanoparticles36 could be exploited for tumor theranostics, such as photothermal therapy (PTT)37 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).38 Combining phosphate ions, a common substance in the human body, with metal elements has created abundant metal phosphates nanomaterials, which provide many candidates for drug delivery39,40 and bone regulation.41 Undoubtedly, the synthesis methods of every type of phosphorus-based nanomaterial should also be highlighted.\nAs different phosphorus-based nanomaterials synthesis methods are currently being developed rapidly, it is urgent to organize them and provide insights for future studies. In this review, we present an overview of the recent progress in the development of phosphorus-based nanoparticles for nanocarriers, cancer theranostics, biosensors, and bone formation in the hope of speeding up their biomedical applications and potential translation into the clinic. We first introduce phosphorus science to organize current phosphorus-based nanomaterials, including phosphorus-containing dendrimer nanoplatforms, BP nanoparticles, metal phosphide nanoparticles, and metal phosphate nanoparticles into one system to provide insights for in-depth studies of phosphorus-based nanomaterials. Under the guidance of phosphorus science, the promising potential of phosphorus-based nanomaterials is proposed. Next, we include several recent representative biomedical applications in delivering drugs and genes using phosphorus-based nanomaterials. These include phosphorus-based nanomaterials that can be used as tumor imaging agents, PTT agents, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agents, regulators of bone formation, and sensors that provide biological information such as microRNA (miRNA) detection. Finally, we point out the challenges in the clinical translation of current phosphorus-based nanomaterials and provide future perspectives. The marriage of nanotechnology and biomedical fields integrated into phosphorus-based nanomaterials offers great potential for future clinical management.\n1Center for Nanomedicine and Department of Anesthesiology, Brigham andWomen’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA 2Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of Phosphorene and Optoelectronics and Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems ofMinistry of Education andGuangdong Province, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China\n*Correspondence: hzhang@szu.edu.cn (H.Z.), wtao@bwh.harvard.edu (W.T.)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2019.12.007"

      "text" : "Dendrimers, symmetric and high-branched polymers with a compact structure,42 have numerous attractive features, including nanoscale cavity,43 molecular structure flexibility,44 and functional group diversity.45 They mainly contain three parts from the core to the surface: (1) a central core including two or more functional groups, (2) repeated monomers covalently bound to the core and organized in homocentric layers called generations, and (3) outer reactive groups on the surface that determine the properties of dendrimers. The dendrimer nanoplatforms that have phosphorus in various positions in their structure play significant roles in various fields46–49 due to the fascinating versatility of the organophosphorus chemistry. Just like other types of dendrimers, phosphorus-containing dendrimers have the following advantages: (1) ease of multifunctional modification; (2) monodispersity, which is important for clinical translation; (3) high anti-cancer drug or imaging probe loading efficiency; (4) excellent cell uptake performance and biocompatibility50; and (5) controllable size. The promising features of phosphorus-containing dendrimers have offered infinite opportunities for their biomedical application. Briefly, the phosphorus-containing dendrimers are fabricated based on the coordination chemistry.51 After decades of development, various types of phosphorus-containing dendrimers were invented, including those with onion-peel dendritic structure,52 those with Janus structure,53 and water-soluble phosphorus dendrimers containing repeating phosphate units.54,55 While other reviews have generally summarized the development of phosphorus-containing dendrimers systematically,56,57 we mainly\nMatter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020 299\n(A) Synthesis of the drug self-framed delivery system.

The two most used phosphorus-containing dendrimers are composed of polyphosphazenes and polyphosphoesters.58,59 As polyphosphazenes and polyphosphoesters degrade in the presence of metabolizable phosphates (and ammonium salts for phosphazene), they are suitable for synthesizing biocompatible phosphorus-containing dendrimers. For example, Lu et al.60 prepared a self-framed delivery system utilizing chemotherapy drugs as a polymer frame without introducing any other components. Specifically, they developed a simple method to fabricate cyclomatrix polyphosphazene nanoparticles (CPPZs), which was derived from the precipitation-polymerization of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) with doxorubicin (DOX) under ambient conditions (Figure 2A). Thanks to unstable P–N bonds, these nanoparticles could respond to the acid environment in lysosomes after endocytosis to release the DOX. In addition, Wooley et al.61 utilized polyphosphoester to prepare polyethylene glycol (PEG) \"PEGylated’’ nanocarriers. To fabricate scalable and high-capacity nanocarriers, they designed the supramolecular and covalently stabilized nanoparticles from versatile amphiphilic block terpolymers via ‘‘click-type’’ chemistries (Figure 2B). The amphiphilic block terpolymers assembled to form well-dispersed and supramolecular micelles, and then, utilizing thiol-yne click-type chemistry, shell cross-linked into knedel-like nanoparticles (SCKs) (Figure 2C). The SCKs acted as suitable nanoplatforms for highly concentrated paclitaxel delivery."

      "text" : "Compared with metals, metal oxides, and sulfide nanomaterials, the synthesis of metal phosphide nanomaterials is difficult, mainly due to the high reactivity of the phosphorus source.63,64 However, as more synthesis techniques were developed, more metal phosphides were synthesized. Among them, the transition metal phosphide nanomaterials have received the most attention because of their ample physical and chemical properties.65,66 Briefly, there are two main approaches for metal phosphide nanomaterials\n300 Matter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020\nsynthesis: solution-phase reaction67 and gas-solid reaction.68 In the solution-phase reaction method, the widely used phosphorus resource is tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP).69 The covalent bond between carbon and phosphorus is unstable if the temperature is higher than 300 C and reacts with compounds that have the metal element (bulk metal, metal nanomaterials, metal acetylacetonates, metal carbonyl compounds, and metal oxides) to generate the metal phosphide nanomaterials. Besides using TOP, other substances, such as tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO)70 and tri-phenylphosphine (TPP),71 could also be utilized in the synthesis of metal phosphide nanomaterials. For instance, Zhang et al.62 used the high-temperaturemethod to synthesize one-dimensional Fe2P nanomaterials, subsequently modified by trithiol-terminated poly-(methacrylic acid) (PTMPPMAA) to improve the hydrophilicity and biocompatibility (Figure 2D). Meanwhile, Yu et al.72 also utilized the high-temperature thermal decomposition method and TPP to fabricate CoP nanoparticles and then used Tween 20 for surface modification. Another way to prepare transition metal phosphide nanomaterials is by using the gas-solid reaction. In short, the gas-solid reaction utilizes substances including NH3H2PO2 and NaH2PO2 to generate PH3 73 in situ, and the reaction with metal oxides, hydroxides, and metal-organic frameworks occurs to synthesize transition metal phosphides. Compared with the solution-phasemethod, this strategy has advantages, such as being surfactant free, and it is easy to maintain the dimension/morphology of the precursors. However, the excessive PH3 should be collected. In addition, H2, 74 metal orthophosphates, andhigh temperature (650 C)couldbeused topreparemetalphosphides,which is mainly used for molybdenum and tungsten phosphides. However, the size of metal phosphides synthesized through thismethod is not at nanoscale level, which is not desirable for further biomedical applications. Furthermore, there are few ways to synthesize transition metal phosphide nanomaterials. Cu and cobalt phosphide nanomaterials on the Cu substrate could be fabricated via electrochemical anodization. Also, white/red phosphorus and metal salts can be used to synthesize transition metal phosphide nanomaterials with various nanostructures via the hydrothermal approach. The abovementioned methods basically use hydrophobic solvents, so it is necessary to conduct hydrophilicmodificationon the surfaceofcorrespondingnanomaterials, ashydrophilicity is important for biomedical applications."

      "text" : "BP nanomaterials mainly contain BP nanodots and BP nanosheets. Among them, phosphorene, two-dimensional BP nanosheets that only have a few layers, has attracted significant attention in recent years. After decades of development, numerous methods have been invented for the synthesis of BP nanosheets, including the top-down method (such as mechanical cleavage and liquid-phase exfoliation techniques) and the bottom-up method (such as chemical vapor deposition and wet-chemistry techniques) (Figure 3A).75 As the van der Waals interaction force between two layers is weak,76 it is feasible to prepare BP nanosheets via mechanical cleavage. However, the production efficiency is relatively low, and it is difficult to control the morphology. Excitingly, the liquid-phase exfoliation method could make it possible to scale up production and achieve good morphology control. In the liquid-phase exfoliation process, organic solvents containing N-methyl2-pyrrolidone (NMP),77 DMSO,78 N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),79 isopropanol (IPA),80 and ethanol81 could be used for the dispersion of bulk BP. To further enhance the dispersibility of BP nanosheets, deoxygenated aqueous surfactant82 has also been introduced. This enhanced the stability of the material as well. In addition, the chemical vapor deposition method83 could control the thickness, size, and crystallinity of BP nanosheets. Another wet-chemical solvothermal approach uses bulk red phosphorus84 as a precursor to generate BP nanosheets.

For example, they prepared BP nanodots via the liquid exfoliation method.85 Briefly, 20 mg of BP powders were first dispersed in 20 mL of NMP and then sonicated using a sonic tip (frequency, 19–25 kHz) for 4 h (2-s periods with 4-s intervals) at 1200W. Subsequently, the mixture was sonicated overnight in an ice bath at 300 W and then centrifuged for 20 min at 7,000 rpm. The residual solution contains the BP nanodots with a size of about 3 nm (Figure 3B).

For example, CaPs are widely used in the field of bone regeneration due to their superior biocompatibility100 and their unique role in human bone. Compared with other types nanomaterial, metal phosphate nanomaterials are mainly generated via the hydrothermal method,101 which is relatively simple. For example, Kataoka et al.87 used a simple two-step approach, including the hydrothermal process, to synthesize stable organic-inorganic hybrid CaPs with the gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) incorporated inside (Figure 3E). To modulate the size and uniformity of metal phosphate nanomaterials, hydrophobic reagents such as oleic acid and oleamine are widely utilized in the synthesis process. In addition, Hou et al.88 used the method to synthesize MnP for tumor imaging and drug delivery. Specifically, 1 mL of oleic acid and 4mL of oleylamine were dissolved in 15mL of toluene and stored in a Teflon autoclave. Then 0.2 mL of water and 1 mL of Mn(acac)2 were then added to the systemwith vigorous stirring. Subsequently, the solution in the autoclave was reacted at 180 C for about 9 h. After centrifugation and further modifications, MnPs with the uniform size of about 18 nm were successfully prepared (Figure 3F)."

For example, Ni et al.102 used the DOX derivative containing an azide group to link the chain of [PEEP-b-PBYP-Se]2 to generate smart nanomaterials, which not only enhances the drug’s loading efficiency but also performs the pH/reduction responsive drug release (Figure 4A). Thanks to high loading efficiency, Mei et al.103 utilized BP nanosheets loaded with various molecules to realize multiple functions, including fluorescent/near-infrared (NIR) imaging and therapy (Figure 4B). Meanwhile, benefitting from the diverse structures, the phosphorus-containing dendrimers could have rapid responses to external stimuli57,104,105 (such as UV light). The BP nanosheets could also respond to external stimuli (such as NIR light and low pH) due to the unique two-dimension structure."

Thanks to their biodegradable nature, BP nanosheets would rapidly change to phosphate anions in different cancer cells to influence their energy metabolism and then kill them, while not affecting normal cells. The opposite roles in cancer cells and normal cells is ascribed to the different environments of cancer cells and normal cells (stronger intracellular oxidative stress in cancer cells).111 Specifically, BP nanosheets would degrade to phosphate anions under conditions of water and higher oxidative stress.85 Although phosphate anions are shown to be safe in in vivo studies, transient increase of cytosolic phosphate anions would strongly affect ATP hydrolysis112 and subsequently induce cancer cell death.113 Moreover, the structures and functional groups of phosphorus-containing dendrimers give them outstanding biological properties for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease by interfering with the amyloidogenic process,114 which is discussed in the following section in detail. Moreover, metal phosphate nanomaterials, especially hydroxyapatite nanomaterials, exhibit remarkable biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo, making them feasible candidates for biomedical applications. Most importantly, calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite nanomaterials are chemically similar to the inorganic parts of the bone matrix, thus presenting much better osteoconductive and osteoinductive abilities compared with traditional bone substitutes.115 With these distinguished biological properties, metal phosphate nanomaterials have been broadly utilized to repair bone tissues.\nBiosafety and In Vivo Metabolism Regarding the potential clinical application of phosphorus-based nanomaterials, the most concerning issues are their biosafety and in vivo metabolism. For the phosphorus-containing dendrimers, the most used phosphorus-containing dendrimers, the polyphosphazenes and polyphosphoesters, could degrade into non-toxic substances, as discussed above. In addition, the other parts used in the synthesis of phosphorus-containing dendrimers are mainly necessary molecules116,117 or metal elements,17 which do not greatly influence the biosafety. In addition, some researchers118,119 have indicated that the cytotoxicity of BP nanosheets caused by intracellular generation of ROS and disruption of the integrity of the cell membrane depended on the size and dosage. Meanwhile, the BP nanosheets could degrade into non-toxic phosphate ions in vivo. However, the metal phosphide nanomaterials may have poor biosafety because of the toxic reactants and difficulty in degrading. Unlike the above phosphorus-based nanomaterials, the biosafety of metal phosphate nanomaterials has been widely recognized and some of them, such as CaPs and hydroxyapatite, have been approved for bone substitute applications. Overall, even though many kinds of research have indicated the in vivo biocompatibility of phosphorus-based nanomaterials, the evaluation method is relatively simple and cannot fully reflect the biosafety of phosphorus-based nanomaterials. In addition, the lack of research on the metabolism of these phosphorus-based nanomaterials in vivo hinders further clinical translation. The existing problems also promote further research on phosphorus-based nanomaterials. For instance, the surface modification120 or the introduction of liposome,121 erythrosome,122 and exosome123\nMatter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020 305\nfor phosphorus-based nanomaterial encapsulation may greatly enhance their biosafety and benefit their metabolism."

      "text" : "With the deep understanding of cancer evolution, various chemotherapy drugs have been developed to cure different types of cancer. In clinics, chemotherapy plays an important role, but the side effects of current chemotherapy drugs are unavoidable. In order to perform a controlled release of chemotherapy drugs and reduce potential toxicities, nanocarriers have been studied for delivering drugs for decades. Compared with traditional chemotherapy drugs, nanocarriers, including phosphorus-based nanocarriers, have the advantages of high loading efficiency, long circulation time, ability to target tumors, and low side effects. For example, Yu et al.124 incorporated BP quantum dots into liposome bilayers (BPQDs@Lipo). Excitingly, embedding biocompatible BP quantum dots that respond to certain stimuli in the liposome bilayer allowed a controlled release of chemotherapy drugs. The final versions of nanomaterials were synthesized by the thin lipid film hydration method, as shown in Figure 5A. Under irradiation with an 808-nm laser, the DOX was released rapidly from the BPQDs@Lipo and showed a laser intensity-dependent tendency (Figure 5B). This improved the fluidity of the lipid membranes and even damaged the structure when the temperature increased. Moreover, the BP nanosheets were combined with light-responsive hydrogel to perform a controlled DOX release according to Zhang et al.125 They prepared the BP@hydrogel composed of BP nanosheets and biocompatible agarose hydrogel, which released the loaded DOX upon NIR light irradiation (Figure 5C). Bhattacharyya et al.37 introduced polydopamine-coated cobalt phosphide nanorods (Co2P@PDA NRs) not only for DOX release but also for PTT. Compared with the 7% DOX released in the solution at pH 7.4 without laser, about 39% of DOX was released at pH 5.5 without laser. Moreover, the ratio of drug release increased to 35% and 60% at pH 7.4 and 5.5, respectively, when the NIR laser irradiation was introduced. This is due to the higher kinetic energy of DOX (Figure 5D). Not only chemotherapy drugs but other molecules, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), can be carried and released at specific sites. For example, Sun et al.126 synthesized GSH-responsive hyaluronic acid/calcium phosphate hybrid nanomaterials to deliver siRNA for melanoma tumor therapy. Specifically, siRNA was loaded to the CaPs via electrostatic interaction to generate a positively charged core and then combined with the HA-ss-HA (disulfide crosslinked hyaluronic acid) part. The whole nanoplatform was able to escape from the endosomes because CaPs had a membranolytic capability. When they encountered the reductive environment, the siRNA was released efficiently (Figure 5E). In addition, Fuentes et al.127 also evaluated structure-optimized interpolymer polyphosphazene complexes to perform gene delivery on glioblastoma. They prepared differently substituted poly(phosphazene)s. The tolerability assays using the spheroid model indicated that CA-PPZ/6MHA-PPZ:pDNA complexes demonstrated a better therapy performance than CA-PPZ:pDNA and PEI:pDNA (Figure 5F).

Not only metal phosphide/phosphate nanomaterials but also phosphorus-containing dendrimers and BP nanomaterials have been introduced in tumor imaging, tumor therapy, and neurodegenerative disorder therapy. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar tangles in the brain, and the aggregates of b-amyloid peptides (Ab) have neurotoxicities even though the mechanism is still unknown. A number of studies have indicated that aggregation of Ab could result in less acetylcholinesterase activity, ROS generation, neuroinflammation, damage to mitochondria, and intercellular Ca homeostasis destabilization. In an attempt to treat Alzheimer’s disease, BP nanosheets were synthesized and used to prevent Cu2+-induced neurotoxicity according to Guo et al.114 They utilized the strong binding ability of phosphorus tometal ions. Moreover, the photothermal conversion ability of BP nanosheets helped to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Figure 6A). The ability of BP nanosheets to capture Cu2+ was first evaluated via the following procedures. Themixture was filteredmultiple times after adding BP to Cu2+ solution. As depicted in Figure 6B, the concentration of Cu2+ in solution decreased obviously 1 min after mixing, which indicated excellent Cu2+ capturing ability of BP nanosheets. The main existing form of Cu on BP nanosheets was Cu+ judging from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Figure 6C). Apart from therapies for neurodegenerative disorders, phosphorus-based nanomaterials used in tumor imaging and therapy should also be presented. FI techniques have the advantage of having high spatial and time resolution and have gained much attention in the field of biomedicine. Inspired by the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) mechanism proposed by Tang et al.,128 Long et al.129 introduced polyphosphazene (PZS) to ‘‘isolate’’ and\n308 Matter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020\n‘‘fasten’’ the fluorescent molecules for a stable and enhanced FI performance. The fluorescent molecules were bound to the phosphorus-containing dendrimer. The one-pot polycondensation procedure could generate monodispersed poly(cyclotri-phosphazene-co-dibromofluorescein) (PCTPDBF) nanoparticles with a diameter of about 300 nm (Figure 6D), and the size could be adjusted by changing the concentration. Moreover, PCTPDBF had an excellent resistance to biomolecules; the fluorescence of PCTPDBF decreased slightly compared with the obvious decrease of dibromofluorescein when they were mixed in BSA solution at different concentrations and stirred for 2 h (Figure 6E). Most importantly, PCTPDBF showed a strong fluorescence when co-incubated with cancer cells under 450-nm irradiation, demonstrating a good cell-imaging ability (Figure 6F). Owing to the optical properties, including photothermal and photoelectric conversion capabilities of phosphorusbased nanomaterials, they have been used as agents for PAI, PTT, and PDT. PTT provides numerous advantages, including high treatment efficiency and universality for different tumor types. To solve the problem of biodegradability of most PTT agents, Zhang et al.85 prepared BPQDs encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which can degrade in vivo. The PLGA not only prevented BPQDs from accessing oxygen and water but also controlled the degradation rate of BPQDs. After modifications, BPQDs/PLGA nanomaterials had a stable broad absorption band even after exposure to air for 8 days when dispersed in water (Figure 7A). This primarily showed the protection role of PLGA. However, when dispersed in PBS, the absorption and photothermal conversion abilities of BPQDs/PLGA nanomaterials were very stable after 24 h; they decreased greatly after 8 weeks due to degradation (Figure 7B). A possible degradation mechanism is that the PLGA was degraded to CO2 and H2O, and BPQDs were degraded to biocompatible phosphate and phosphonate (Figure 7C).\nBesides acting as PTT agents, BP nanomaterials can also be used in PDT, which was presented by Xie et al.109 for the first time. Based on the unique electronic structure of BP, they thought it could be a semiconductor that produces singlet oxygen. Utilizing the traditional exfoliating method, they prepared ultrathin BP nanosheets and then evaluated their singlet oxygen production efficacy. As depicted in Figure 7D, the degradation ratio of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) increased when the light irradiation intensity increased on BP ultrathin nanosheets. Further experiments showed good PDT efficiency of BP nanosheets under suitable light irradiation (Figure 7E), which provided new insight into the applications of BP. Apart from the therapy mentioned above, BP nanosheets were also bioactive nanomaterials with inherent and selective chemotherapeutic effects. Yu et al.130 reported the biological abilities of BP that could act as chemotherapy drugs. The chemotherapeutic effects resulted from different degradation performance in cancerous and normal cells. In cancer cells, BP nanosheets degraded to phosphate anions, which abruptly affected homeostasis, leading to cancer cell death. The degradation performance was first monitored in water, and the results showed rapid generation of phosphate anions (Figure 8A). The different degradation rate at the cellular level was further evaluated in A549, MCF-7, and normal human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via Raman scatteringmapping.When treated with 4 mg/mL BP, different cells generated different Raman signal intensities. Cancer cells accelerated the degradation process, which supported their hypothesis (Figure 8B). The possible anti-cancer mechanism of BP was to selectively generate reactions in cancer cells to induce cell-cycle arrest and was not about causing physical damage like graphene oxide does, based on the flow cytometry results (Figure 8C). Apart from the above nanomaterial, metal phosphide nanomaterials have various physicochemical properties that are very suitable for tumor theranostics. For example, Zhang et al.62 combined one-dimensional\nMatter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020 309\n(A–C) (A) Absorption spectra of the BPQDs/PLGA nanomaterials at various times after storing in water.

As expected, the Fe2P generated thermal energy at 1,064-nm irradiation and simultaneously produced ROS via the Fenton reaction. ROS generation promoted the photothermal effects and assisted the ultrasound. Moreover, the Fe element in the nanomaterial and good photothermal conversion efficiency allowed Fe2Ps to show superior PAI and MRI performance (Figure 8D).\nOne of the most promising applications of phosphorus-based nanomaterials in the field of theranostics is microenvironment-responsive amplifiedMRI. Kataoka et al.131 confined Mn2+ to the CaPs with polyethylene glycol.

As planned, the nanoparticles released Mn2+ at a low pH in the TME and enhanced the contrast, which are desirable qualities to monitor millimetersized metastatic tumors. For in vivo T1-weighted MRI, the contrast ratio of the PEGMnCaP-injected mouse was much higher than with the commercial magnetic resonance contrast agent Gd-DTPA, which confirms the amplified MRI effect of this nanoplatform (Figure 9B). Higher-resolution three-dimensional (3D) images using 7-T MRI confirmed that PEGMnCaPs could selectively promote the entire tumor contrast (Figure 9D). In addition, m-SR-XRF (synchrotron radiation-induced X-ray fluorescence) suggested that high levels of Mn were observed in the circle around the metastatic tumor area, which suggested that PEGMnCaPs remained at the margins of the metastasis as they dissociated and released Mn2+ inside the metastatic regions (Figure 9C). Combined with PDT and immunotherapy, metal phosphate nanomaterials could have great anti-cancer effects. For instance, Lin et al.132 generated biocompatible Zn-pyrophosphate (ZnP) nanoparticles (Zn and pyrophosphate are endogenous components in the body) loaded with the pyrolipid (ZnP@pyro), which could kill tumor cells under light irradiation and make tumors sense the checkpoint inhibition modulated by the PD-L1 antibody to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis (Figure 9D).\nIn the field of myocardial disease, oral and needle-based routes are the main ways to administer drugs.

To solve these problems, nanomaterials were introduced to treat cardiac conditions via inhalation. Metal phosphate nanoparticles, especially CaPs, have great potential to deliver therapeutics to specific sites via inhalation. Cataluci et al.133 applied biodegradable and biocompatible CaPs to release therapeutic peptides to cure heart failure through the respiratory tract via inhalation (Figure 9E). As they proposed, and as other researchers have presented previously, nanoparticles, including CaPs, could target the heart to some degree. The CaPs are inhaled into the heart, protect peptides from rapid enzymatic degradation, and increase the cellular permeability because of their negatively charged surface. To evaluate the targeting efficiency of inhalation, the CaPs-Cy7 were first administered to mice and the fluorescence was carefully monitored to compare different administration approaches. While the enteral administration of particles did not show any significance, the CaPs-Cy7 were quickly delivered to the myocardium via parenteral administration, and the performance of the inhalation was even better (Figure 9F).\n312 Matter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020\nEspecially, accumulation of CaPs-Cy7 in the myocardium happened simultaneously with the decrease of CaPs-Cy7 in the lungs, indicating that CaPs-Cy7 was crossing the pulmonary barrier. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) 3D z-stack microscopy of cardiomyocytes further confirmed the targeted delivery of MP-rhodamine-loaded CaPs (Figure 9G) to the heart. Recovery of cardiac function was observed in mice treated with CaPs-MP inhalation and was confirmed by the echocardiographic results (Figure 9H). Most importantly, no obvious toxicity was observed. The HA signals recorded in the myocardium of landrace pigs showed promising results with CaPs inhalation in large animals as well. As more scientists become interested in developing multifunctional nanomaterials with certain properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, suitable physicochemical properties, and imaging ability, phosphorus-containing nanomaterials are likely to gain more attention in the future."

      "text" : "Different methods to collect biological information have been developed rapidly in recent years. A range of nanomaterials have been introduced in this field, including phosphorus-based nanomaterials. As one of the necessary molecules in the body, H2O2 is involved in cell metabolism, proliferation, signal transduction, and survival. Detecting the concentration of H2O2 in cells sensitively and selectively is of great significance. Currently, nanomaterials that are capable of nanomolar detection of H2O2 are mainly metal nanoparticles that are not naturally present in the human body. Excitingly, transition metal phosphide nanomaterials can be used in the hydrogen evolution reaction because of their superb electrocatalytic reduction capability. Zhang et al.106 explored the topotactic conversion method to generate Cu(I) phosphide nanowires on porous Cu foam (Cu3P NWs/CF), which has ultrasensitivity to H2O2 concentration down to the nanomolar level. This has great potential in gathering information about cancer cells (Figure 10A). As the H2O2 concentration increased, the reduction current increased (Figure 10B), which was due to the fact that the metal center transferred electrons to the porphyrin and subsequently reduced H2O2. Furthermore, Sabherwal et al. 134 utilized poly-L-lysine (PLL) to modify BP nanosheets to promote binding with anti-Mb DNA aptamers for detection of cardiovascular disease. Basically, the BP nanosheets were first synthesized and then modified with PLL to ensure Coulombic interactions with DNA (Figure 10C). This BP-based platform could detect a very low concentration (1 pg mL 1) of Mb and had high sensitivity (Figure 10D). In addition to monitoring Mb, Weng et al.135 showed that BP could also be used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA). In this system, the instability of BP was used to detect biomarkers when combined with Au nanoparticles. The final Au nanoparticles decorated with BP (BP-Au) nanoplatforms displayed excellent catalytic ability for reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). Meanwhile, the instability of BP produced electrons that accelerated the reduction process, while the catalytic ability of BP-Au was inhibited after adding anti-CEA. Interestingly, the catalytic process was also triggered when CEA was introduced, because it binds with anti-CEA to generate a complex (Figure 10E). As depicted in Figure 10F, the detection strategy almost completely matched the gold-standard ELISA method when used on clinical samples, which opened up a new window for the biomedical application of BP nanomaterials.\nIn addition, BP nanosheets could also be used as fluorescence-quenching nanomaterials to rapidly detect miRNA.136 miRNAs are involved in modulating gene expression to mediate almost every process of the human body. Thus, miRNA detection has received much attention in recent decades. Zhang et al. used the\nMatter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020 313\n(A and B) (A) Synthesis process of Cu3P nanowires on Cu foam.

As illustrated in Figure 10G, 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)-labeled single-stranded DNA probes (pDNA) were bonded on the BP nanosheet surface through van der Waals forces. Moreover, there is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between FAM and BP nanosheets that can induce fluorescence quenching. Subsequently, pDNA was released again when miRNA was added, because the pDNA formed a duplex with miRNA to take away the bonded pDNA in the BP nanosheets, inducing fluorescence recovery."

Furthermore, phosphate ion generation after BP degradation also has the potential to regulate bone formation. Thus, we discuss some representative studies from the last 5 years on this topic. Utilizing the phosphorus supplied by BP nanosheets, Gu et al.137 prepared BP nanosheet-based hydrogel to accelerate bone formation. In this platform, the BP nanosheets were embedded in hydrogel and then gradually degraded to phosphorus ions to combine with calcium ions to promote bone regeneration (Figure 11A). Meanwhile, BP nanosheets also strengthen the hydrogel framework and improved the osteogenic differentiation process of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). Most importantly, when immersed in simulated body solution for 15 days, obvious mineralization with a white color was observed in the BP-embedded hydrogel platform group (Figure 11B). In addition, Shi et al.138 used the 3D printing technique and BP nanosheets for osteosarcoma therapy and simultaneously promoted bone regeneration. The nanoplatform was constructed by mixing BP nanosheets and the 3D printed scaffold. The nanoplatform formed was used for PTT therapy first and then degraded to calcium phosphate nanoparticles to promote bone regeneration (Figure 11C). After embedding BP nanosheets into the scaffolds, the color of the scaffolds changed to black, and their surface structure showed well-controlled macropores (Figure 11D). Several days after PTT, obvious CaPs were observed. They were formed from the in situ biomineralization between Ca2+ and phosphate ions after the degradation of BP (Figure 11E). This positive process could enhance newborn osseous tissue formation through not only osteoconduction but also osteoinduction (Figure 11F). This work greatly stimulated the development of phosphorus-based nanomaterials and also suggested a new direction for bone engineering. Hydroxyapatite nanomaterials that have superb biocompatibility and biodegradability also showed potential for repairing hard tissues, especially bone regeneration. Mezzenga et al.139 used the bottom-up approach to prepare new nanocomposites, including one-dimensional amyloid fibrils and two-dimensional HA platelets (Figure 11G), which exhibited some promising bone-mimetic characterizations, such as better physical properties than some common clinical bone cements. Also, human trabecular bone-derived preosteoblastic cells survived and proliferated on the new nanocomposites (Figure 11H). In brief, phosphorusbased nanomaterials that can generate Ca2+ or phosphate ions in vivo are suitable candidates for bone regeneration because they induce the generation of CaPO4. Previous studies will promote further exploration of other new phosphorus-based nanomaterials."

With the rapid development of nanotechnology and the unique role of phosphorus in the human body, more phosphorus-based nanomaterials have been successfully prepared and applied in the field of biomedicine. This review systematically divides phosphorus-based nanomaterials into phosphorus-containing dendrimer nanomaterials, BP nanomaterials, metal phosphide nanomaterials, and metal phosphate nanomaterials.

KGaA, Weinheim.\n316 Matter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020\nThere are many problems that need to be solved before nanomaterials can be used in real-world applications. This is the same for phosphorus-based nanomaterials. Although many phosphorus-based nanomaterials have been synthesized and optimized in the past decades, they are still in their infancy, and many problems need to be analyzed and resolved. We point out these challenges and propose useful prospects. First, we know that the production of current major phosphorus-based nanomaterials (only at the milligram level) is insufficient for in vivo applications. Hence, we need to develop easier methods to produce enough phosphorus-based nanomaterials and ensure their reproducibility. Second, the distribution and metabolism of phosphorus-based nanomaterials in the body is still unclear. Therefore, it is urgent to use advanced imaging techniques (such as MRI, computed tomography imaging, and positron emission computed tomography imaging) to monitor the metabolism of phosphorus-based nanomaterials and accurate distribution at different time points. In addition, the interactions between nanomaterials and substances in the body have been studied for many years, including the phenomenon of protein corona. In general, almost all nanoparticles absorb proteins in the blood through electrostatic interactions, interactions with –SH and hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic effects, thereby forming a shell that inhibits the functions of nanomaterials. Furthermore, the long blood circulation time of phosphorus-based nanomaterials is important for high therapeutic efficiency. In order to solve these problems, surface modification of phosphorus-based nanomaterials is required. Also, the target efficiency of most phosphorus-based nanomaterials is relatively low, which not only inhibits the therapeutic efficiency but also causes many side effects on normal tissues. In addition, the death mechanisms at the molecular level of cancer cells induced by different phosphorus-based nanomaterials need to be clarified, which will contribute to the application and optimization of phosphorus-based nanomaterials in biomedicine. In addition, the main administration modes of phosphorus-based nanomaterials in vivo include intratumoral and intravenous injection, which may not be applicable for many types of cancer, so it is more suitable to utilize one administration method for each type of cancer. Nowadays, thanks to their biocompatibility and unique biological properties, metal phosphate nanoparticles, including hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate nanoparticles, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are widely used for mimicking bone structure, including EquivaBoone (Zimmer Biomet), NanOss (RTI Surgical), Ostim (Heraeus Kulzer), OsSatura (IsoTis Orthobiologics), and Vitoss (Acorda).140 However, for phosphorus-containing dendrimers, although one of the most investigated polyphosphazene polyelectrolytes (poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy) phosphazene]) has been tested in phase I clinical trials as an adjuvant with an influenza vaccine on young and elderly adults,141 there are still no phosphorus-containing dendrimers developed for clinical trials. There are also no clinical trials ongoing that use BP nanomaterials and metal phosphide nanomaterials. To date, although many nanomaterials have been approved for use in clinical practice or studied in clinical trials, clinical use of most current nanomaterials still faces many challenges. First, the standards for nanomaterial classification and characterization have not been determined, even though some attempts have been made.142,143 Another frequently reported issue for nanomaterials is the toxic effects; some FDA-approved nanodrugs were withdrawn from the list due to safety concerns, such as Feruglose and Resovist,142 so the biosafety of phosphorus-based nanomaterials should be thoroughly evaluated. In addition, specific regulatory guidelines for nanomaterials should be established in clinical trials, even after approval for clinical use. Also, the cost-benefit problem needs to be considered for the clinical translation of nanomaterials, because only collaboration between research institutions and companies can promote the clinical translation process, and this issue is important for\nMatter 2, 297–322, February 5, 2020 317\ncompanies. Despite the existing challenges ahead for real-world biomedical applications, phosphorus-based nanomaterials still have a bright future.\nIn response to the above problems and challenges, several suggestions are proposed in detail below, with the ultimate goal of applying them in the real world. Just like the development of chemotherapy drugs, further exploration and optimization of phosphorus-based nanomaterials should consider specific TMEs, inherent physicochemical properties, and external energy field stimulation. First, only some features of the TME, such as low acidity, overproduced H2O2, relative hypoxia, and much GSH, have been utilized in the diagnosis or treatment of disease. Other features, such as low catalase activity and the need for more nutrition, should also be considered. For example, we could use phosphorus-based nanomaterials to trigger starvation of tumor cells for therapies. Second, we should also pay more attention to identifying and using the specific features of different cancer models. For instance, phosphorus-based nanomaterials are well suited for the treatment of orthotopic liver cancer, because they are mainly accumulated in liver tissues, which results in passive tumor targeting. Both imaging and therapy molecules should be combined when designing phosphorus-containing dendrimer nanomaterials, realizing real-time monitoring and therapy assessment. The targeting molecules could be introduced on the surface of phosphorus-based nanomaterials not only to reduce the formation of protein corona but also to enhance the targeting efficiency. As the properties are highly related to the morphology, size, and surface modification, we should invent simple and effective methods to prepare phosphorus-based nanomaterials with different sizes and morphologies. Furthermore, many other energy fields (thermal, magnetic field, ultrasound, and electricity) except light could be applied to trigger the imaging or therapy abilities of phosphorus-based nanomaterials. Most importantly, the specificity and biocompatibility of phosphorus-based nanomaterials must be carefully studied and optimized to prevent potential damage to normal cells, which is critical for applications in the real world. In summary, phosphorus science is a promising field of research that needs further efforts from scientists in material science, medicine, chemistry, and biology. The ultimate goal is to pursue and design suitable phosphorus-based nanomedicines combined with advanced diagnostic tools and external energy field stimulation to provide specific, precise, and safe protocols for the treatment of cancer and other diseases."

In this review, we first introduce the phosphorus science to unify current phosphorus-based nanomaterials and discuss their synthesis methods, various properties, and corresponding biomedical applications. The marriage of nanotechnology and biomedical fields integrated into the phosphorus-based nanomaterials offers great potential for future clinical management. INTRODUCTION As the main elements in the human body, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus are essential. Among them, phosphorus plays an indispensable role considering the following aspects: (1) it is one of the basic components of nucleic acids that make up genetic substances; (2) it is a necessary part of body fluid, regulation of acid-base balance, and energy metabolism; (3) it forms proteins, teeth, and bone. In the new century, almost all of the significant achievements in the fields of biology and biochemistry are closely related to compounds containing phosphorus and carbon, opening up a very attractive world for the application of phosphorus compounds. Inorganic phosphates have been used for medical purposes for a long time, such as antacid magnesium phosphate, aluminum phosphate gels, diuretics, and laxative sodium dihydrogen phosphate. There are more commonly used phosphate-containing drugs, such as analgesic codeine and the antimalarial drug chloroquine, because the phosphate can increase the water solubility of the drug and rarely interferes with the physiological pH. However, medicinal organophosphorus compounds have undergone a tortuous development process due to the rapid development of organophosphorus pesticides, resulting in concerns about \"toxic organic phosphorus.\" Fortunately, numerous organophosphorus drugs have been used in cancer treatments such as cyclophosphamide and pyrophosphoric acid mustard. This has brought great attention to developing more useful phosphorus-based agents in cancer treatments.",
