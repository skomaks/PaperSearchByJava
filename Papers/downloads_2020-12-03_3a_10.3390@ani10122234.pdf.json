      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Feed additives of trace minerals in nanoparticles were recently used to improve the productive and reproductive parameters of farm animals [1,2]. The nano-scaled size particles, e.g., nano zinc-oxide (ZnO-NPs; 1–100 nm), provided novel physical, chemical, and biological properties [3,4]. Zinc plays a pivotal role in the sperm cell functions, including lipid flexibility, cell membrane stabilization [5], sperm capacitation, and acrosomal reaction [6]. Moreover, it was found to increase the semen volume, total live sperm count, sperm motility and conception in heat-stressed rabbits [7], while its deficiency exerted oxidative damages, infertility, and worse sperm quality due to impaired spermatogenesis, lowered testosterone secretion, and increased sperm abnormalities [8]. Zinc supplementation was used to improve the sperm count, motility, form, function, quality, and fertilizing capacity [1]. The commonly used grains in rabbit diets are rich in phytate that may reduce or inhibit absorption of zinc [9,10]. Thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) improves the growth rate, antioxidant activity, and appetite promotion [11–16]. Likewise, supplementation with thyme oil (THO; 0.5 g/kg) was found to improve the intestinal integrity and total antioxidant status of rabbits [17]. The main components of thyme oil are thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, g-terpinene, linalool, b-myrcene, and terpinen-4-ol [13,18]. Those constituents were known to have antioxidant properties [19] and may improve liver and kidney functions and abdominal fat accumulation [13,20]. The present study investigates the effects of zinc in nanoparticle form and thyme essential oils for improving the reproductive parameters, nutrient digestibility coefficients, and some blood metabolites of the male Californian rabbits."

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "Dietary essential oils are digestive enhancers with specific antimicrobial activity which promotes the general health condition [14,27]. Thyme oil (THO) accordingly showed a beneficial effect on the rabbit performance, welfare, and health status especially in hot environments [13,17,28]. It was reported\nthat thyme oil plays a pivotal role in stimulating the feed intake, increasing the body weight/gain and intestinal integrity, and thus improving the overall feed conversion ratio [13,17]. Those positive effects were attributed to the thyme compounds on the digestive efficiency [29]. Furthermore, zinc oxides in the form of nanostructure have become interesting areas of research in animal husbandry [30]. Due to scarcity of available reports on effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles on the male of rabbits, comparison was done with other studies that used other zinc sources. Nanoparticles exhibit novel properties, such as great specific surface area, high surface activity with high catalytic efficiency [31]. The mineral nanoparticles can increase absorption [32,33]. Zinc requirement for rabbits is 30–170 mg/kg dry matter, with higher requirements for breeders [34,35]. Zinc plays a pivotal role in carbohydrates, lipids and protein metabolism for energy utilization liberated from feeds digestion [36,37]. The mineral is approved as essential cofactor for the metabolic reactions and enzyme activity especially the carrier proteins regulating digestion [38]. It was found that higher proportion of Zn (170 mg/kg) had improved the nutrient digestibility of rabbits compared to non-treated control group [35]. Simultaneously, in this study, the nanoparticles of zinc oxide (ZnO-NPs; 100 mg/kg BW), thyme oil (THO; 500 mg/kg BW), or their combination significantly increased the dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, and crude fiber digestibility compared to each respective control group that could be attributed to improvement of enzymes’ activities induced by zinc [39–42] in addition to the improved digestibility induced by thyme [43] as stated in other species. Chandak et al. [44] found that THO has a synergistic effect with zinc oxide and showed higher levels of antimicrobial effect against the root canal pathogens. In present study, rabbits received either ZnO-NPs, THO, or their combination significantly lowered the serum levels of ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine when compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, concentrations of testosterone in the serum increased significantly in those male rabbits received with ZnO-NPs, THO, or their combination when compared to the control (p < 0.05). Improvement in liver and kidney functions as well as that the male sex steroid, testosterone, is attributed to the role of Zn in many biochemical processes and physiological functions. It has been reported that Zn is required for the normal function of plentiful structural proteins, enzymes, and hormones which are necessary for growth and development [45]. The improved concentrations of testosterone in response to Zn-diets supplemented groups might be due to enhancing the Leydig cells of the testis for increasing the levels of testosterone production [7,46,47]. A combination of ZnO-NPs and THO improved liver and kidney function as well as serum testosterone of Californian male rabbits indicating a possible synergistic effect of ZnO-NPs and THO in improving testosterone secretion. The study showed that supplementation of the ZnO-NPs, THO, or their combination to rabbits exhibited a significant increase in the ejaculate volume, sperm viability, and sperm motility. No information is available regarding the effect of nano zinc oxide supplementation on semen quality and fertility of male rabbit. However, our results were consistent with Moce et al. [48] who stated increased numbers of spermatozoa of rabbit bucks fed on rations supplemented with zinc in amount of 35 to 100 mg/kg, as compared to their control group. Supplementation of Zn in doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg to rabbit diet increased spermatozoa concentration of male rabbits [49]. Zn plays a pivotal role in the production of spermatozoa in parallel to the synthesis of DNA and RNA by enhancing the activity of DNA and RNA polymerases [50]. Furthermore, Zn supplementation was reported to duplicate the blood concentration levels of testosterone in adult men [51]. Acconcia and Marino [52] have reported that all the mammalian steroids including testosterone are biosynthesized from cholesterol. Testosterone is anabolic agent especially for the skeletal muscles and brain, and the trace amount of testosterone is synthesized in the adrenal cortex, but the profound production comes from the interstitial testicular Leydig cells [52]. Effects of ZnO-NPs and/or THO on blood testosterone could reflect their effects on cholesterol or other cellular and biochemical factors. Previous studies in other animal species stated that thyme extract [20] or ZnO-NPs [53] significantly lowered the blood concentrations of cholesterol. Accordingly, the blood cholesterol could be directed for the production of testosterone in agreement with our findings. Moreover, Zn concentrations in the\nLeydig cells were found to be significantly lowered in mice fed a Zn-deficient diet compared to controls, and that the zinc transporter-7 (ZnT7) was principally expressed in the Leydig cells ZnT7 which plays an important role in the regulation of testosterone synthesis by modulating the steroidogenic enzymes [54]. All above suggests that zinc could play a direct pivotal role on those testosterone-secreting cells which coincide with our findings for the highest increment of testosterone in response to ZnO-NPs supplementation. The effect of thyme on the blood testosterone concentrations was studied in male rats showing significant increase of the hormone in response to 5% thyme-supplemented diet compared to control throughout 28 days [55]. Therefore, supporting our results, coadministration of ZnO-NPs and THO synergistically increase the testosterone concentration rather than each alone. Two pathways could explain our findings; (a) testosterone synthesis from cholesterol induced by THO [20], or (a) endogenous molecular factors in the Leydig cells stimulated by the ZnO-NPs which require additional research and molecular studies [54]. The same pathway explains the increased secretion and volume of seminal plasma from the accessory genital glands which mainly depend on the testosterone secretion [56]. Those findings suggest that either ZnO-NPs or THO could stimulate the Leydig cells to secrete the synthesized testosterone, but the combined treatment, i.e., ZnO-NPs plus THO, may enhance both the synthesis and secretion of the hormone from its sources. Dietary supplementation with those additives compensate for the deficient nutrients required for male fertility and could resume the normal pathway of spermatogenesis, including the sperm cells morphology, vitality, and motility, in addition to stimulating the sex glands to produce much of the seminal plasma."

One hundred rabbits, 29-weeks of age (initial body weight 3.48 ± 0.08 kg) were randomly distributed into four groups, 25 rabbits each. Treatment groups were fed a control diet, a control diet supplemented with ZnO-NPs (100 mg/kg), THO (500 mg/kg), or combination of ZnO-NPs (100 mg/kg) and THO (500 mg/kg). The feeding trial lasted for 35 days. Results showed improvements in dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, and crude fiber in ZnO-NPs, THO, and their combination treated groups compared to those of control. Furthermore, semen volume, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology were significantly improved (p < 0.01) in ZnO-NPs and THO groups rather than the control. Both ZnO-NPs and THO, as either individual or combined treatments significantly improved the serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT), aspartate amino-transferase (AST), urea, and creatinine compared to the control. Moreover, serum concentrations of testosterone were significantly increased in rabbits supplemented with ZnO-NPs, THO, or their combination compared to those of control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ZnO-NPs, THO, or their combination improved the digestibility of nutrients, liver/ kidney functions, semen characteristics, and testosterone concentration in male rabbits.",
