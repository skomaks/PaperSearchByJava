      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Polymer electrolytes have been extensively studied by the worldwide researchers in the recent years, due to their importance in theoretical studies and their potential application in different fields such us polymer science, electrochemistry, organic and inorganic chemistry. The electrical and optical properties of polymer based electrolytes and nano-composites are crucial to be investigated [1]. Wide range electrochemical stability, leakage-free nature, light weight, solvent free characteristics, easy preparation techniques, safety and durability are the most significant advantages of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) [2,3]. The (SPEs) with good mechanical stability and flexibility can provide a better contact between electrode and electrolyte for electrochemical device applications [4]. However, poor electrical conductivity of solid polymer electrolytes at room temperature restricts their practical performances [5]. The occurrence of the ionic transport of solid polymer electrolytes can be observed only in the amorphous polymer regions [6]. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is one of the host polymers in the preparation of solid polymer electrolyte for the metal ion conducting batteries, because it has high electrochemical stability with ion dissociation ability and nontoxicity. However, PEO has helical structure with semicrystalline polymer so it can exist in both crystalline and amorphous phase, as well as low melting point (60 ◦C) [7–9]. Unfortunately, PEO-based polymer electrolyte has low conductivity at temperature <70 ◦C due to phase crystallinity. Nonetheless, good conductivity value is supposed to be at least 10−4 S/cm and this can be achieved only at temperature range between 80 and 100 ◦C. Thus, this issue limits its practical applications [10–13]. In the literature different approaches were proposed to enhance the conductivity of PEO-based polymer electrolyte. One of the approaches is to use inorganic salts particularly alkali metal salts like lithium, sodium and potassium salts. PEO possesses good solvating ability because ether oxygen atom has lone pair electrons and cations are strongly coordinated with the polymer [14–16]. Different inorganic salts such as LiCF3SO3, LiClO4, LiPF6 and NaIO4 are reported by Ahn et al. [17] and Koduru et al. [7]. Additionally, the literature documented that the conductivity issue of SPE for energy device applications can be solved using inorganic salts specially alkali metal salts [18–21]. A number of studies reported that the ionic conductivity increased with higher salt concentration [22]. Another popular method includes the addition of nano inorganic fillers to improve the ionic conductivity for instance TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and Ag NPs [17,23,24]. Cerium oxide (CeO2) as a highly relevant nanoparticle has attracted a great attention due to its exceptional chemical and physical characteristics that can be applied in various fields like\n-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\nfuel cell, catalyst, ultraviolet absorber, medicine, electrodes for sensors, etc. It can act as a membrane stability enhancer in the fuel cell application, even when present in a small amount, it has the ability to extend the durability of fuel cell membranes [25–28]. Consequently, in the CeO2 structure, several oxygen vacancies exist that becoming high mobility of oxygen. Additionally, cerium oxide can switch between Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states, relying on whether it is available in the case of reducing or oxidizing [29]. Dey et al. were reported the effect of CeO2 nanoparticle in the PEO:NH4ClO4 salt complex. It was demonstrated that the CeO2 has a great impact on ionic conductivity of the PEO based SPE systems [30].\nDielectric relaxation and ion conduction mechanism in solids are among the most intensively studied topics in condensed matter physics. Particularly, the study of dielectric relaxation in solid polymer electrolytes is a powerful approach which extracts information about the characteristics of cation–polymer interactions. Additionally, the dielectric constant plays a fundamental role to show the dissolving ability of polymer material for a salt [31,32]. In our previous works we observed a high value of dielectric loss parameter (ε′′) compared to dielectric constant (ε′) parameter [31–36].\nFrom physics viewpoint, high dielectric constant value compared to dielectric loss parameter is crucial; especially for advanced materials which have wide range applications in modern technology e.g. battery and electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC). Nano-materials may constitute nanocapacitor through the electrolyte system. The contribution of many nano-capacitors to the ion dissociation and producing space charge polarization may enhance the dielectric constant which in turn improves the charge storage capacity. The main challenge in the field of polymer electrolyte is to prepare a system with high charge storage property and low dielectric loss value. Electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC) is considered as one of the main category of electrochemical capacitors in addition to hybrid and pseudo capacitor. EDLC can be used in carbon-based electrodes and various choices of electrolyte material. These capacitors can be a good alternative to other kinds of charge storage especially rechargeable batteries. In a non-Faradaic charge storage mechanism, the accumulation of charges takes place on the surface of carbon electrodes forming double-layer capacitor [37,38]. EDLC has good endurance, high thermal stability, good power density, low cost, high safety and excellent cyclability [3]. As the EDLC is connected to the power supply one electrode turns to a negatively charged electrode which attracts cations and repulses anions while a reverse action takes place at the positive electrode [39]. In the present study, the influence of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles on the electrochemical properties of PEO:NH4SCN based nano-composite polymer electrolyte will be investigated using various techniques.\nj m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l . 2 0 2\nP 5 ( n a b c u P a t t d C a s a N n i fi a t p t\n2\nE p u s b p c w t\n2\nL t e o D T a\noly (ethylene oxide) PEO with molecular weight of ,000,000 g mol−1 from Alfa Aesar, ammonium thiocyanate NH4SCN 99% purity) from Merck, cerium dioxide (CeO2) anoparticle (size ≤20 nm, purity 99.9%) from Sigma Aldrich, cetonitrile (ACN 99.9% purity) from Alpha Chemika have een used as raw materials for the preparation of nanoomposite solid polymer electrolyte. All the chemicals were sed with no further purification. For this purpose, 1 g of EO was dissolved in 40 ml of ACN solution. Subsequently,\nconstant weight ratio (40 wt.%) of NH4SCN was added to he solution. The solution was stirred continuously with he magnetic stirrer at room temperature until complete issolution was achieved. Finally, various weight ratios of eO2 were added to the polymer salt mixture and stirred until\nclear solution was obtained. CeO2 content in the prepared amples was varied from 1 to 5 wt.%. The samples were coded s PEOCE1, PEOCE2, and PEOCE3 incorporated with PEO:40% H4SCN incorporated with 1 wt.%, 3 wt.% and 5 wt.% of CeO2 anoparticle, respectively. The solutions were then spilled nto different clean and dry glass Petri dishes, covered with lter paper to avoid any impurities. Finally, samples were llowed to evaporate slowly at room temperature, in order o obtain dry and a free-standing PEO nano-composite solid olymer electrolyte films. Table 1 shows the composition of he prepared samples.\n.2. EIS spectroscopy\nlectrical impedance spectroscopy of the prepared films was erformed in the frequency range between 50 Hz and 1 MHz sing LCR meter (HIOKI 3531 Z Hi-tester, Japan). For this meaurements, a pair of stainless steel electrode was used as locking electrode to keep thin films of nanocomposite solid olymer electrolyte (diameter = 2 cm).

      "heading" : "3.1. Impedance and DC conductivity study",
      "text" : "For better understanding the electrical properties of the electrolyte material and ion mobility at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique is vital [40]. This technique is performed by applying an alternate electric signal to the SPE over a broad range of frequencies at ambient temperature, from which the electrochemical system can be studied and the ionic conductivity can be determined. Two stainless steel discs were used as blocking electrode, to sandwich the solid polymer electrolyte films [41]. The movement of ions and concentration of charge carriers are affected by polymer electrolyte film conductivity [42]. Fig. 1 shows the impedance plots of PEO:NH4SCN:CeO2 at room temperature by varying the content of CeO2. Normally, the complex impedance plot consists of a high frequency semicircle region, which is due to the bulk effect of the electrolyte (bulk combination with bulk resistance) and a low frequency spike due to the effect of blocking electrodes [38,41]. Bulk resistance is presented by semicircle at high frequency while spike at low frequency is due to charge double-layer. The interception between a semicircle and spike can be considered as the bulk resistance (Rb) [43]. From the Nyquist plots, it can be revealed that as the ratio of nanocomposite fillers increased from 1 wt% to 3 wt%, the diameter of the semicircle shrunk, which illustrated that the Rb has been reduced. 5% CeO2 increase the Rb again due to the immobile polymer chains or blocking effect. This would lower the charge carriers and cause a reduction in the conductivity of the systems. The reduction of the semicircle indicated that the amorphous\n9286 j m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l . 2 0 2 0;9(x x):9283–9294\nnature of the polymer system enhanced [44,45]. On the other hand, the disappearance of the semicircle signified the nonDebye behavior of polymer electrolytes [46]. DC conductivity ( dc) for each system is calculated using the following equation and presented in Table 2:\ndc = (\n1 Rb\n) × ( t\nA\n) (1)\nwhere t is the thickness of the sample and A is the area of the electrode. The influence of CeO2 nanoparticles on the ionic conductivity of PEO:40%NH4SCN systems were investigated by utilize varying content of CeO2. The maximum ionic conductivity is 8.57 × 10−4 S/cm for PEO:40%NH4SCN:3%CeO2\ned on PEO:NH4SCN (a) 1% CeO2, (b) 3% CeO2, (c) 5% CeO2.\nnano-composite solid polymer electrolyte system. The ionic conductivity increased as the nanocomposite ratio increased by up to 3%. Further increase in the CeO2 nanoparticle content above 3% resulted in lower conductivity because of the overcrowding the ions in the polymer network [47]. This conductivity is much greater than the recorded value of (7 × 10−7 S/cm) in the literature for PEO:NH4SCN electrolyte [48]. It is well reported that both ionic associations, and PEO crystallinity can be greatly impacted by the hydrogen bonds of PEO and NH4SCN which in turn effect on the overall conductivity of the prepared SPE [49]. The use of nanoparticle as a conductivity enhancer was proven. Various nanofillers have been added to the PEO based polymer electrolyte systems such as SiO2, TiO2 with the highest ionic conductivities at room temperature of 8 × 10−6 S/cm, and 3 × 10−5 S/cm, respectively which reported by Scrosati et al. [24] and for the PEO:LiClO4:Al2O3 was 4 × 10−5 S/cm examined by Ahn et al. [17]. Qi et al. [50] reported that the PEO-LiClO4-CeO2 NSPEs with the maximum conductivity of 1.71 × 10−5 S/cm. Hence, the current study of PEO:NH4SCN:CeO2, has a higher ionic conductivity than PEO-LiClO4-CeO2 system.\nj m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l . 2 0 2 0;9(x x):9283–9294 9287\n3\n3 D p c t t t o p\nε\nε\nw i r a P\nelectrode/electrolyte interface.\nlectrolyte samples at room temperature.\n.2. Dielectric properties\n.2.1. Study of dielectric constant and dielectric loss ielectric constant analysis is an essential method to identify hase transitions, and ionic transport mechanism in polymer omposites. Through this analysis one can extract informaion regarding the dielectric relaxation behavior and relate it o their ionic conductivity upon frequency. Dielectric properies of the polymer composite systems are illustrated based n the plots of the real (ε′) and imaginary part (ε′′) of complex ermittivity which can be calculated from the formulas below:\n′ = Z ′′\nωC0(Z′2 + Z′′2) (2)\n′′ = Z ′\nωC0(Z′2 + Z′′2) (3)\nhere ω is the angular frequency, C0 is the vacuum capactance, Z′′ is the imaginary part of impedance and Z′ is the eal part of impedance [51]. Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate the ε′\nnd ε′′ as a function of frequency at room temperature for EOCE1, PEOCE2, and PEOCE3 samples. It can be seen that at\ntemperature.\nthe low frequency the dielectric constant reach the maximum value because of the high concentration of charged species. While, large electric dispersion at the higher frequency region can be observed. Sharp rise in the dielectric constant at the low-frequency region for PEOCE2 sample indicates the higher ionic conductor, which reflects the influence of ion species polarization and ionic mobility conductors [52].\nThe value of dielectric constant reaches to zero at the higher frequency region, due to the reduction in electronic polarization [53]. One can note that, as the frequency increased, the dielectric constant gradually dropped and approached constant value at the very high frequency region. However, due to the dipoles alignment to the direction of the field in a low-frequency region the dielectric constant is increased [54]. From the figures, both ε′ and ε′′ are increased with addition of larger weight percent ratio of CeO2 nanoparticle up to 3 wt.% of PEO systems. Nevertheless, further increase in the CeO2 content to 5 wt.% caused a dramatic drop in the dielectric constant, resulted from the blocking effect at the\nFigs. 4–6 provide information on the complex permittivity as a function of frequency at room temperature for PEOCE1, PEOCE2, and PEOCE3, respectively. It is obvious that the value\n9288 j m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l . 2 0 2 0;9(x x):9283–9294\ntemperature.\nof the ε′ for all PEO:NH4SCN:CeO2 nanocomposite polymer electrolytes much higher than the ε′′ value. Among the samples, the maximum value of the dielectric constant for the PEOCE2 sample has been recorded while the minimum value obtained from the PEOCE3 sample. As mentioned in introduction section we observed a high value for ε′′ in comparison to ε′ parameter in our previous works for polymer based electrolytes and nanocomposites [31–36]. It is well established that the high dielectric constant value compared to dielectric loss parameter is suitable for electrochemical device application. The possible explanation for the high value of ε′ in comparison to ε′′ is the development of many nano-capacitors inside the PEO nano-composite electrolyte. The nano-capacitors promote ion dissociation and creating space charge polarization which may improve the dielectric constant which. The main challenge in the field of polymer electrolyte is to prepare a system with high charge storage property (high dielectric constant) and low dielectric loss value. From Figs. 4–6, it is obvious that the value of ε′ is nearly double that of ε′′. The high value of ε′ refers to high value of capacitance (ε′ = C/C0) and thus high charge storage property (C = Q/V)."

      "text" : "Study of dielectric relaxation phenomena is considered as a vital method to explore the molecular interaction in the solid polymer-based electrolytes [55]. The segmental motion of the polymer backbone within the polymer matrix plays an important role in ions transference that can be perceivable with the relaxation process [56]. Accordingly, to observe the relaxation behavior in the PEOCE electrolyte films, the tangent loss (tanı) was analyzed. The loss tangent (tanı) can be defined as a ratio of dielectric loss per dielectric constant and it is a measure of electrical energy lost ratio to the stored energy in a periodic field [57,58]. The variation of loss tangent (tanı) versus frequency measured at room temperature for the PEO:NH4SCN electrolyte systems incorporated with the various amount of CeO2 nanoparticle is presented in Fig. 7. Its noticeable that the loss tangent rise with increasing frequency, and reached the highest value at specific frequencies, owing to the rapid increase of the active components (i.e., ohmic) of current than\ntemperature.\nthe reactive components (i.e., capacitive). Further increase in frequency leads to a drop in the (tanı), which is due to the reactive components proportionally rise with the frequency, and the active components of current are independent of frequency practically [59–61]. It can be argued that the appearance of the peaks at a characteristic frequency indicates the existence of dipoles relaxation in the whole samples [62,63]. It is well documented that the increase of segmental motion of polymeric chain reduces the relaxation time which in turn facilitates the transport process. This is mathematically formulated in = 1/2 fmax, where is the relaxation time for the ionic charge carrier. In other words, as long as the ion fluence increase, the relaxation time is diminished which reflected the rise in ionic conductivity because of the increment in the segmental motion of the system. These perceptions purpose that there is an increment in the amorphous region in the PEOCE2 based NCSPE [56]."

In particular, the modulus spectroscopy plot can be used to separate the components which have the same resistance but different in capacitance, recognize polarization of electrode, relaxation time, bulk properties, as well as electrical conductivity. Complex modulus (M*) can be classified as imaginary and real parts. The dielectric modulus of PEO:NH4SCN:CeO2 polymer electrolytes were calculated from the impedance data (i.e., Z′ and Z′′) by utilizing the following equations [64–66]:\nM′ = ε ′\n(ε′2 + ε′′2) = ωCoZ ′′ (4)\nM′′ = ε ′′\n(ε′2 + ε′′2) = ωCoZ ′ (5)\nFigs. 8 and 9 show the variation of real part (M′) and imaginary part (M′′) of electrical modulus at ambient temperature\nj m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l . 2 0 2 0;9(x x):9283–9294 9289\nr i o a g p v r T m t t t t t t m\n3\nT D\noom temperature as a function of frequency.\nespectively, for CeO2 ratio-dependent PEO:NH4SCN composte polymer electrolyte as a function of frequency.

The alue of complex modulus (M′, M′′) increased as the frequency ises, and reached maximum at the higher frequency regions. his is related to the lack of returning force governing the ovement of ions [66]. From the modulus plots, the relaxation ime can be noticed at a high-frequency end and designated hat the polymer composite electrolyte films are ionic conducors [69]. Nonetheless, the absences of relaxation maybe due o the limited frequency range of the instrument [54]. Between he CeO2 weight percent ratios the imaginary modulus specrum demonstrated that the film PEOCE2 has low-intensity\nodulus which means that it has a higher ionic conductivity.\n.3. TNM study\nransference number measurement has been done using the C polarization method, to determine the contribution of\nion species in the solid composite polymer electrolyte systems. Both ions and electrons species take part in the total of ionic transport [70,71]. Two essential parameters are used to comprehend the conductivity of materials which are tion and electron transference number (te). Non-blocking electrode is an electrode where both ion and electron can pass through while for blocking electrode, only electrons can pass through the electrodes. te should be smaller than the ion tion for polymer composite electrolyte since films are ionic conductor, and signifying the dominancy of ions to the overall conductivity [72,73].

This might be due to the reduction of ions in the NCSPEs. At the steady-state phase, since only electron can migrate along the electrolyte interface, the cells become polarized [74]. The value of tion can be determined using the following equations:\ntion = 1 − te or tion = Ii − Iss/Ii (6)\nwhere Ii and Iss are the initial current and steady-state current, respectively. The value of initial and steady-state current are extracted from the TNM plot. The calculated tion values are 0.84, 0.96 and 0.92 for PEOCE1, PEOCE2, and PEOCE3, respectively. Among the NCSPEs, PEOCE2 (3 wt.% CeO2) has the highest tion and it is near to the ideal value of unity. These results approve that ions is the most vital conducting species in the electrolyte [70,72–74]. Other studies reported that good electrolytes possess tion > 0.90 [75,76]."

At low scan rate, efficient ionic conduction can be achieved where ions can form proper charge-double layer at the surface of the electrolyte which resulting in the increment\n. 2 0 2\no p s o t C u\nC\np\nt a a c i\n4\nI n ( t i t T a f d 3 s ( p t g t e t p p E a\nC\nT\nA\nT t R t U T\nr\nj m a t e r r e s t e c h n o l\nf capacitance [85,86]. It can be observed that each CV plot ossesses a small bump or peak. This signifies that the energy torage mechanism of the EDLC in this work is combination f double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. The exisence of small bump in the CV plots could be to presence of eO2 in the electrolyte. The redox reaction can be expressed sing the following equation:\neO2 + H+ + e− YCeO2 (8)\nCeO2 is known as reversible redox material with pseudocaacitive behavior [87].\nPseudocapacitance is produced by an electron chargeransfer between electrode and electrolyte coming from an dsorbed ion and de-solvated. No chemical reaction occurs mong absorbed ion and atoms of the electrode. Pseudoapacitance and double-layer capacitance both contribute nseparably to the total capacitance value [88].\n. Conclusion\nn the current study, the influence of cerium oxide CeO2 anoparticle on the PEO:40%NH4SCN solid polymer electrolyte SPE) systems have been investigated. Electrical and dielecric properties of NCSPE films have been evaluated through mpedance, dielectric and modulus spectroscopy. Various echniques such as TNM, LSV, and CV have been characterized. he highest ionic conductivity at room temperature has been chieved with 3 wt.% CeO2 where the conductivity increased rom 3.81 × 10−5 S/cm to 8.57 × 10−4 S/cm. A reduction in conuctivity value can be observed if CeO2 content exceeded\nwt.%. From dielectric analysis, dielectric constant (ε′) for all amples has found to be much higher than the dielectric loss ε′′) value. The LSV showed that the PEO:40%NH4SCN:3%CeO2 ossessed electrochemical stability up to 1.4 V. Ions has idenified as the primary charge carriers in the electrolyte and ave bigger contribution to the total conductivity compared o electron. tion of the sample with 3 wt.% CeO2 has discovred to be 0.96. The outcomes from CV analysis revealed that he presence of CeO2 in the electrolyte introduce a small seudocapacitive behavior. Both double-layer capacitance and seudocapacitance contribute to the total capacitance in the DLC. A maximum specific capacitance of 86.8 F/g has been chieved at 20 mV/s.\nonflicts of interest\nhe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\ncknowledgements\nhe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for his study from Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific esearch-Kurdish National Research Council (KNRC), Kurdisan Regional Government/Iraq.

    "abstractText" : "Solution casting technique has been successfully employed to prepare nano-composite films. Various weight ratios of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticle were added to a PEO:NH4SCN:xCeO2 polymer matrix to enhance the ionic conductivity at ambient temperature. The electrical and electrochemical properties of the composite electrolyte systems have been investigated using impedance, dielectric properties (ε*, tanı, and M*), transfer number measurement (TNM), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The highest ionic conductivity of ∼8.57 × 10−4 S/cm is obtained for the system incorporated with 3 wt.% of CeO2 filler. This study presented a new approach and the complex permittivity confirmed that the real part value of dielectric constant (ε′) for all samples has found to be much higher than the imaginary part (ε′′) value. The appearance of the peaks at a characteristic frequency in the loss tangent indicates the existence of relaxation. Low lectrochemical properties DLC dielectric modulus is observed for 3 wt.% of CeO2 incorporated. The TNM measurements confirmed the ionic conductivity of NCSPEs and ion transport tion of films have been found to be 0.84, 0.96 and 0.92 for 1 wt.%, 3 wt.%, and 5 wt.% of CeO2, respectively.

From the CV analysis it is noticeable that the energy storage mechanism of the EDLC is a combination of double-layer capacitance and pseudo capacitance.
