Given the global threat and increasing influence of antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent demand to explore novel antibacterial strategies other than using antibiotics. Recently, using a certain surface topography to provide a more persistent antibacterial solution attracts more and more attention.

Thus, the pillar array should be equipped with other antibacterial agents to fulfill the bacteriostatic and bactericidal requirements of clinical application.

The pillar array with sub-micron motif size can significantly inhibit the adhesion, growth, and proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Such antibacterial ability is mainly attributed to a spatial confinement size-effect and limited contact area availability generated by the special topography of pillar array. Moreover, the pillar array is not lethal to S. aureus and E. coli in 24 h. Then, the X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array in vitro and in vivo will be systematically studied in a future work.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Medical implants have revolutionized modern medicine, but they also involve a higher risk of implant-associated infection that is a severe and frequent complication related to biomaterial applications [1–3]. In the USA, the implant-associated infections account for 25.6% of all healthcare-associated infections [4]. Notably, the implant-associated infections are generally difficult to cure owing to the bacterial antibiotic resistance [3] which is attributed to the widespread usage of antibiotics [5,6]. Many eventual failures of medical implants are caused by the bacterial infection at healing sites [7–11]. Currently, antibioticresistant infections result in 700,000 deaths per year all over the world [5]. If there is still no effective solution to combat against the antibiotic resistance, the number of global victims will rise dramatically to 10,000,000 per year by the middle of the 21st century [5].\nGiven the global threat and increasing influence of antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent demand to explore novel antibacterial strategies other than using antibiotics [12–20]. Recently, using a certain surface topography to provide a more persistent antibacterial solution attracts more and more attention [5,21–26]. Traditionally, researchers focused on the bacterial responses to the surfaces with different roughness values (Ra), but the conclusions were contradictory [27–31], because the surfaces with identical Ra values could possess totally different surface topographies and identical randomly textured surfaces can hardly be reproduced [32]. Alternatively, researchers turned to devote efforts in studying the bacterial responses on reproducible regular patterned surfaces which were inspired by natural antifouling surfaces [33]. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that Si periodic pillar arrays with sub-micron motif sizes could significantly inhibit bacterial adhesion, proliferation, and colonization by a spatial confinement size-effect [34,35]. Our findings suggested that nano-pillar array might be the optimal topography design against bacteria, which was coincident with the design of nature for the bactericidal topographies on the surface of cicada wing [36–41], dragonfly wing [38,41,42], and gecko skin [43]. The findings [34] were reported even before the first announcement of the natural bactericidal topography on the surface of cicada wing [36].\nHowever, the clinical application of biomimetic nano-pillar array is not satisfactory [41], mainly because its antibacterial ability against Gram-positive strain including Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is not good enough [37]. Since S. aureus usually causes implant-associated infections [3,44], the biomimetic nano-pillar array should be equipped with other antibacterial agents to fulfill the bacteriostatic and bactericidal requirements of clinical application. Recently, Ye et al. [41] combined a nano-pillar array and ZnO nanoslices to prepare a cicada & catkin inspired structure that was demonstrated to simultaneously have ideal biocompatibility, better bacterial anti-adhesive property, broader antibacterial range, and long-lasting antibacterial activity. ZnO-based nanomaterials possess high antibacterial activity against both Grampositive and -negative bacterial strains [45–48], which has been mainly attributed to Zn2+ ions release, bacterial cell membrane damage, and photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [49,50].\nSimilar to ZnO, TiO2 is another popular biocompatible and bioactive biomaterial [51–54] with photocatalytic antibacterial activity which has been ascribed to the generation of ROS that can oxidize organic materials up to complete mineralization [55,56]. Briefly, the organic material oxidization affects the bacterial membrane permeability first (Scheme 1a and 1b), then gradually damages all cell wall layers to make the bacteria leak small molecules and ions (like K+) (Scheme 1c) followed by higher molecular weight components (e.g., RNA and protein) (Scheme 1d) [56]. Eventually, the degradation of bacterial internal components occurs (Scheme 1e) followed by complete mineralization (Scheme 1f) [56]. UV induced photocatalysis on TiO2 is well known [56], while the X-ray induced photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has attracted much more attention for biomedical applications since it has a prominent characteristic that a non-invasive treatment can be achieved\nby adjusting the X-ray penetration depth through the human body [57]. This implies the X-ray irradiation may be used to intentionally trigger the photocatalysis of TiO2 in vivo to kill the bacteria near or on the TiO2 surface of a medical implant, which could inhibit the implant-associated biofilm formation or eliminate the already-formed biofilm without surgical or invasive treatments in a controllable manner.\nHere, we aimed to design a novel model substrate which was a combination of periodic micro/nano-pillar array and TiO2 for basically understanding the topographical bacteriostatic effects of periodic micro/nano-pillar array and the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of\nScheme 1. Schematic illustration for the photocatalytic bactericidal process of a bacterium on TiO2 surface. (a) An intact bacterium; (b) Bacterial membrane permeability will be affected by an organic material oxidization effect generated from the TiO2 photocatalysis, but this permeability change is reversible. The arrows indicate the sites where the permeability has been changed; (c) All cell wall layers will be further destroyed, which will make the bacterium leak small molecules and ions (like K+). Bacterial damage will be irreversible from this stage; (d) Leakage of higher molecular weight components such as RNA and protein; (e) Degradation of bacterial internal components such as nucleoid; (f) Finally, the bacterium will be completely mineralized to H2O, CO2, and minerals.\nTiO2. Such innovation may potentially exert the synergistic effects by integrating the persistent topographical antibacterial activity and the non-invasive X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 to combat against antibiotic-resistant implant-associated infections. A high-throughput screening idea was introduced to fabricate one flat area as control and nine patterned areas (motif size 0.6 μm–20 μm) on a single chip for efficiently discovering which size of TiO2 periodic pillar array possessed higher antibacterial activity. Sphere-shaped S. aureus and rod-shaped Escherichia coli (E. coli) were employed in this work since they are common pathogens for medical implant infections [3,44] and they have distinct morphologies. First, to separately verify the topographical antibacterial activity of TiO2 periodic micro/nanopillar array, we systematically investigated its effects on bacterial adhesion, growth, proliferation, and viability in the dark without involving the photocatalysis of TiO2. Then, the X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array in vitro and in vivo will be systematically studied in a future work."

In this study, we designed to locate one flat area and nine patterned areas on a single Si chip. Every two areas were insulated by a 4-μm-wide fence. As shown in Fig. S1, the pillar array motif size was defined as below:\npillar array motif size= pillar width (W)=pillar length (L)= spacing (S).\nThere were nine different motif sizes corresponding to nine patterned areas (Fig. S1). Since some motif sizes were shorter than 1 μm, a high-resolution mask aligner (ASML 5000 Stepper, Resolution=0.5 μm, Reduction ratio= 5:1) was used for photolithography in this study. The design of stepper photomask is schematically shown in Fig. S1. Owing to the reduction ratio (5:1) of the stepper, the original dimension of the pattern on the stepper photomask should be designed 5 times longer than the actual dimension of the motif."

The thin film deposition was conducted under an argon gas pressure of 5× 10−3 Torr at a constant RF power of 100W at 25 °C for 300 s [58].

To further decrease the surface charging effect during SEM observation, a low accelerating voltage (5 kV) was employed in this work [61–64].\nSurface chemical compositions of samples were analyzed by an Xray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS; Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos, Japan). The broad range XPS spectra were obtained with an Al Kα excitation source (hυ =1486.6 eV) and a take-off angle of 90° at a passing energy of 160 eV.

The diffraction patterns were collected using Cu-Kα radiation (wavelength= 1.54056 Å) “in a 2θ range of 20°–80° with a step size of 0.05° and a count time of 2.5 s” [58].\nThe water contact angles (WCA) of samples were measured by a sessile drop method using a contact angle instrument (DIGIDROP, GBX, France).

Briefly, “frozen S. aureus or E. coli strain was streaked on an agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for a minimum of 12 h” [35]. An aseptic micropipette tip was used to scrape off an as-prepared bacterial colony on the agar plate. Then, the micropipette tip was put into a test tube filled with LB liquid medium. The test tube was incubated in an orbital shaker at 37 °C for one incubation cycle which was determined by bacterial growth curves. Using the bacteria which have entered the exponential phase of growth can ensure the bacteria stay in the same situation for following assays. After incubation, the turbidity (OD600) of the bacterial suspension in the test tube was measured using a turbidimeter (eppendorf BioPhotometer, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The initial bacterial colony forming unit (CFU) density of the bacterial suspension can be calculated via multiplying the OD600 value by 109 CFU/mL.

      "text" : "The TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar arrays were prepared by a process of Si wafer photolithography plus a RF magnetron sputtering followed by a thermal oxidation, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Firstly, we introduced a high-throughput screening idea to design and fabricate one flat area as control and nine patterned areas on a single Si chip (size= 10×10mm) (Fig. 2a), which ensured that the ten areas could be cultured in the same environment and ten groups of data could be obtained simultaneously after the following bacterial experiments [35]. Thus, the experimental efficiency could be increased by 10 times. Furthermore, every two areas were insulated by a 4-μm-wide and 3-μmhigh fence (Fig. 2b) to avoid potential interferences between every two areas in following bacterial experiments [35]. On every patterned area, the pillar width and length were equal to the spacing between two pillars, and the heights of all pillars were 3 μm (Fig. 2b). The nine patterned areas were named with their pillar array motif size as SiPA_20 μm, SiPA_10 μm, SiPA_5 μm, SiPA_2 μm, SiPA_1.4 μm, SiPA_1.2 μm, SiPA_1.0 μm, SiPA_0.8 μm, and SiPA_0.6 μm (Fig. 2c). The flat area was named as Si_Flat (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the location arrangement of the ten areas on a chip was random (Fig. 2a), not according to the pillar array motif size order to avoid potential edge/central effects which\nmight interfere the results obtained from the following bacterial experiments [35]. So far, a Si scaffold had been successfully obtained.\nAfter the RF magnetic sputtering and the thermal oxidation, the chip color changed as shown in Fig. 3a and b, which was an indirect evidence of a thin film formation on the Si scaffold. Fig. 3c shows the morphology of flat Si substrate under a magnification of ×50,000. While after the Ti thin film deposition and the thermal oxidation, it could be seen under the same magnification (× 50,000) that a continuous and dense thin film with small and homogenous size of grains was formed on the flat Si substrate (Fig. 3d). In addition, when comparing morphologies before (Fig. 3e, Fig. S2a, and Fig. S2c) and after (Fig. 3f, Fig. S2b, and Fig. S2d) the Ti thin film deposition and the thermal oxidation, we could find that a thin film with the identical morphology shown in Fig. 3d also formed on the side-wall of the pillar (Fig. 3f), the top of the pillar (Fig. S2b), and the surface of the substrate (Fig. S2d). All these SEM observations provided direct evidences to demonstrate that a conformal thin film was successfully formed on the whole Si pillar array. Since the thin film thickness was only about 52 nm as shown in a cross-section view (Fig. 3g), the topography of the Si scaffold (Fig. 2c) was maintained after the thin film formation.\nThere was no obvious difference between the broad range XPS spectra of the thin film coated pillar array and the thin film coated flat surface (Fig. 3h). The broad range XPS spectra (Fig. 3h) indicate that the thin film contains the components of Ti and O together with C which is a common surface contamination element. Moreover, the highresolution XPS spectra corresponding to Ti 2p (Fig. S3) can help to better understand the Ti chemical state. Similarly, there was no obvious difference between the high-resolution XPS spectra of the thin film coated pillar array and the thin film coated flat surface either (Fig. S3). There are two typical electron binding energies of Ti which are 453.6–454.2 eV (oxidation state 0, Ti metal) and 458.8–459.2 eV (oxidation state +Ⅳ, TiO2). The high-resolution XPS spectra corresponding to Ti 2p (Fig. S3) show that the binding energy for Ti 2p peak is at ~458.8 eV, which indicates that all Ti components are Ti4+ and Ti0 do not exist in the thin film. These results confirmed that the sputtered Ti thin film had been completely transformed to TiO2 by the thermal oxidation.\nNotably, both the thin film coated pillar array and the thin film coated flat surface did not exhibit any obvious difference in their XRD diffraction patterns (Fig. 3i). Typical TF-XRD patterns (Fig. 3i) confirm that the crystalline phase of the TiO2 thin film covering the Si scaffold is rutile. The diffraction patterns (Fig. 3i) do not show any peak of Ti, which double confirms that the thermal oxidation have completely transformed the deposited Ti thin film to TiO2. In addition, it is reasonable that the Si signal from the substrate shows in the diffraction patterns (Fig. 3i), because the TF-XRD can obtain signals from the bulk material ~1 μm away from the material top surface while the TiO2 thin film thickness was only about 52 nm as mentioned above.\nFinally, well-defined TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar arrays were obtained. Similar to the naming rule of Si scaffold, the ten areas were named as TiO2PA_20 μm, TiO2PA_10 μm, TiO2PA_5 μm, TiO2PA_2 μm, TiO2PA_1.4 μm, TiO2PA_1.2 μm, TiO2PA_1.0 μm, TiO2PA_0.8 μm, TiO2PA_0.6 μm, and TiO2_Flat.\nThe results of WCA measurement revealed a significant influence of pillar array motif size on the wettability of patterned TiO2 surface. As shown in Fig. 3j, the WCAs monotonically reduce from 52.3° to 16.1° with decreasing the pillar array motif size from 20 μm to 0.6 μm. The WCA of TiO2_Flat was 56.4° (Fig. 3j) which was slightly higher than that of TiO2PA_20 μm. Therefore, all the ten areas were hydrophilic since their WCAs were all smaller than 90°, which indicated that the surface energies (γ) of all the ten areas were relatively high."

This phenomenon may be attributed to the distinct shapes, sizes, and physiological behaviours of the two bacterial strains. Therefore, the characteristic contour corresponding to certain pattern type and bacterial strain deserves to be archived in a database.

      "text" : "On the basis of statistical analysis results, the TiO2 periodic micro/ nano-pillar array with sub-micron motif size could effectively inhibit or retard the adhesion, growth, and proliferation of S. aureus and E. coli. A proposed main antibacterial mechanism of periodic micro/nano-pillar array is illustrated in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Briefly, S. aureus can adhere (Fig. 7a), elongate & proliferate (Fig. 7b), and colonize (Fig. 7c) on a flat surface as usual, while the bacterial behaviours (Fig. 7d, e, and f) are significantly interfered by the periodic micro/nano-pillar array as evidenced by the compressed shapes of S. aureus shown in Fig. 7e and f. Rather than occupying a large area of surface by proliferating to form a close-packed colony (Fig. 7c), the S. aureus is imprisoned by a narrow space (Fig. 7f) constructed by the periodic micro/nano-pillar array.\nSimilarly, both the hypothesis models and the SEM actual observation (Fig. 8a, a′, b, b′, c, and c′) indicate that the elongation and binary fission of E. coli are normal when an E. coli is on a flat surface. However, when an E. coli locates at the bottom of a periodic micro/ nano-pillar array, its elongation and binary fission seem to be constrained, as shown in Fig. 8d, d′, e, e′, f, and f’.\nFig. 3.

Error bar= SD. Inset: illustrating the measuring method of WCA which is smaller than 90°.\nIt is believed that one main reason for the antibacterial property of periodic micro/nano-pillar array is a spatial confinement size-effect which traps bacteria between pillars, limits the attachment area for bacteria, and impedes the bacterial cell-cell interactions [26,35]. Nevertheless, the antibacterial property cannot be attributed to the\nphotocatalytic effect of TiO2 since the bacteria were cultured with the samples in the dark.\nIn addition, the wettability of nine TiO2 patterned surfaces and one TiO2 flat surface was systematically investigated since different wettability might result in different affinity for bacteria. Specifically, the\npillar array motif size plays a vital role in the wettability of patterned TiO2 surfaces, since the WCAs monotonically reduce with decreasing the pillar array motif size, as depicted in Fig. 3j. All the ten areas are hydrophilic because their WCAs are smaller than 90° (even smaller than 60°). Among them, the TiO2_Flat has the largest WCA as 56.4°, while the TiO2PA_0.6 μm possesses the smallest WCA as 16.1°. It is generally believed that super-hydrophobic surfaces have an effective ability in decreasing bacterial adhesion [67,68]. However, in this work, the experimental results (Figs. 4–6) revealed that the TiO2PA_0.6 μm with the smallest WCA (super-hydrophilic) possesses the greatest ability to resist bacterial adhesion. This controversy will not be a surprise. Xu et al. [69] reported that a hydrophilic polyurethane pillar array with a submicron motif size has a higher resistance to bacterial adhesion compared with a flat surface or micron-sized patterns. The reductions in\nbacterial adhesion are dependent on the pattern motif size which determines the contact area availability for bacteria [69]. Notably, the contact area availability is a principal decisive factor affecting bacterial adhesion on hydrophilic patterned surfaces [69], which could also be used to perfectly explain the experimental results presented in this study.\nGenerally, the interactions between bacteria and material surfaces can be affected by various properties of the material surface, including wettability, surface energy, charge, chemical components, elastic modulus, topography, and so on [67]. Bacterial behaviours on the material surface could be synergistically influenced by these properties, hardly manipulated by any single property unless it is dominant. This is why mild hydrophobic surfaces cannot always decrease bacterial adhesion [67]. Thus, the spatial confinement size-effect and the limited\ncontact area availability are the main antibacterial mechanisms for the hydrophilic TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array with sub-micron motif size."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusions",
      "text" : "Here, we designed a novel model substrate which was a combination of periodic micro/nano-pillar array and TiO2 for basically understanding the topographical bacteriostatic effects of periodic micro/ nano-pillar array and the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of TiO2. Such innovation may potentially exert the synergistic effects by integrating the persistent topographical antibacterial activity and the non-invasive X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 to combat against antibiotic-resistant implant-associated infections. This work systematically studied how TiO2 periodic micro/nanopillar array affected the bacterial behaviours, including bacterial adhesion, growth, proliferation, and viability. The TiO2 periodic micro/ nano-pillar array with sub-micron motif size can significantly inhibit the adhesion, growth, and proliferation of S. aureus and E. coli. Specifically, TiO2PA_0.6 μm can reduce 62% of S. aureus adhesion at 30min, 73% of E. coli adhesion at 30min, 60% of S. aureus colonization at 24 h, and 70% of E. coli colonization at 24 h compared with the TiO2 flat surface. Such antibacterial ability is mainly attributed to a spatial confinement size-effect and limited contact area availability generated by the special topography of TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array, but cannot be ascribed to the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 since the bacteria were cultured with the samples in the dark. Rather than using a model material as Si, this study employed a common biocompatible and bioactive biomaterial (TiO2) to further confirm that the topographical antibacterial effects are independent of substrate chemistry. Moreover, the TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array is not lethal to S. aureus and E. coli in 24 h, no matter what the pillar array motif size is (from 20 μm to 0.6 μm). Then, the X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array in vitro and in vivo will be systematically studied in a future work.\nNevertheless, the multi-step fabrication process of the model substrate is somewhat laborious. Besides, the bulk material of the model substrate is still Si instead of Ti of which strength is high enough for clinical applications. Additionally, the photolithography plus magnetron sputtering may not adapt well to a more complicated 3D substrate other than flat surface. Although the model substrate is still far from\nclinical applications owing to the above-mentioned shortcomings, this study could shed light on the direction of surface topography design for future medical implants to combat against antibiotic-resistant implantassociated infections without using antibiotics, which may eliminate health concerns caused by the widespread, long-term, and excessive usage of antibiotics.\nAuthor contributions\nX.G. and Y.L. conceived the experimental system and analyzed the figures and data; X.G. carried out the material synthesis and characterization; and Y.D. performed part of material synthesis and characterization.

    "abstractText" : "Implant-associated infections are generally difficult to cure owing to the bacterial antibiotic resistance which is attributed to the widespread usage of antibiotics. Given the global threat and increasing influence of antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent demand to explore novel antibacterial strategies other than using antibiotics. Recently, using a certain surface topography to provide a more persistent antibacterial solution attracts more and more attention. However, the clinical application of biomimetic nano-pillar array is not satisfactory, mainly because its antibacterial ability against Gram-positive strain is not good enough. Thus, the pillar array should be equipped with other antibacterial agents to fulfill the bacteriostatic and bactericidal requirements of clinical application. Here, we designed a novel model substrate which was a combination of periodic micro/nano-pillar array and TiO2 for basically understanding the topographical bacteriostatic effects of periodic micro/nano-pillar array and the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of TiO2. Such innovation may potentially exert the synergistic effects by integrating the persistent topographical antibacterial activity and the non-invasive X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 to combat against antibiotic-resistant implant-associated infections. First, to separately verify the topographical antibacterial activity of TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array, we systematically investigated its effects on bacterial adhesion, growth, proliferation, and viability in the dark without involving the photocatalysis of TiO2. The pillar array with sub-micron motif size can significantly inhibit the adhesion, growth, and proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Such antibacterial ability is mainly attributed to a spatial confinement size-effect and limited contact area availability generated by the special topography of pillar array. Moreover, the pillar array is not lethal to S. aureus and E. coli in 24 h. Then, the X-ray induced photocatalytic antibacterial property of TiO2 periodic micro/nano-pillar array in vitro and in vivo will be systematically studied in a future work. This study could shed light on the direction of surface topography design for future medical implants to combat against antibiotic-resistant implant-associated infections without using antibiotics. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioactmat.2019.10.006 Received 7 August 2019; Received in revised form 10 October 2019; Accepted 17 October 2019 Peer review under responsibility of KeAi Communications Co., Ltd. ∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗ Corresponding author. ∗∗∗ Corresponding author.
