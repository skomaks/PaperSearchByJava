      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Nowadays, the importance of energy is so much that it is interpreted as an energy crisis. The energy crisis means the gradual shutdown of factories and power plants, disruptions in transportation, reduction of gasoline for vehicles, the closure of schools in the winter, no airplanes flying, etc. In the last hundred years, energy dependency has increased dramatically, and we are heavily dependent on fossil fuels that are running out. Coal, gas, and oil constitute about 80% of the world’s energy consumption. Energy consumption in the last fifty years has been higher than energy\nng 550000, Vietnam. Rostami), masoudafrand@\nconsumption in the two centuries before [1,2]. The US Energy Information Agency forecasts world energy consumption to grow by 57% by 2030. Due to the problems of fossil fuels (environmental pollution, limited and endless resources, renewability and direct policy influence), the world has shown a tendency for renewable energies including solar, wind (for wind machines), biomass [3], geothermal, hydrogen [4e6], nuclear energy [7], etc. Solar power comes from nature, and because humans do not interfere with its production, it does not cause pollution [8,9].\nSimple technology, reducing air pollution and the environment, and most importantly saving fossil fuels for the future by converting them to essential living materials using petrochemical techniques, are the reasons for the need for solar energy [10e14]. The sun not only is a great source of energy, but it is also the beginning of life and the source of all other energies. According to\nscientific estimations, it has born from about 6000 million years ago, producing 4.2 million tons of energy per second as a result of nuclear fusion [15]. Due to the sun’s weight, which is about 333 000 times the Earth’s weight, it could be a huge source of energy for the next 5 billion years. The diameter of the sun is 1.39 109 m, the temperature in the center of the sun is about 10e14 million C. The radiation is emitted from its surface at a temperature of about 5600 C by electromagnetic waves into space [16e18]. By measuring the solar radiation flux above the Earth’s atmosphere, we can calculate the total power received from the sun, which is about 1.8 1011 MW [19,20]. Of course, almost half of the total solar energy is absorbed by the atmosphere and just less than half of it is absorbed by the earth’s surface [21e23]. The energy thus obtained in the form of visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light is about 1 kWh/ m2 [24]. Fig. 1 shows the amount of primary energy produced from various sources in the US in 2009. It can be seen that the share of new energies is not significant [25,26].\nThe most important issue in solar energy is its absorption and storage. Solar energy is absorbed by different collectors for different purposes such as electricity generation, water heating, space heating, etc. [29]. The abundance and cheapness of energy at certain times of the day are important reasons for energy storage. Solar energy is abundant in the daytime, but one of the major drawbacks of this energy is its inaccessibility at night. Energy storage can also be used in the absence of the sun [30,31]. In some countries, such as China, where electricity is mostly used for home heating, due to the low cost of electricity per day and its high costs at night (due to peak hours of consumption), energy storage is an important solution [32,33].\nEnergy storage is done in mechanical, electrical and thermal\nFig. 1. Primary production of energies from v\nforms. Thermal energy storage (TES) is carried out in sensible (through specific heat of materials such as water, earth, etc.) and latent (through phase change of materials such as paraffin, hydrated salt, etc.) [34,35]. PCMs are widely used in various industries including textiles, satellites, telecommunications and medicine due to the change in their states. Materials with the melting temperature of less than 15 C are used for air conditioning and extreme cooling in phenomena that do not undergo regular temperature changes, while those with the melting temperature higher than 90 C are used to prevent fires where temperatures may suddenly rise [36e38]. Fig. 2 shows melting enthalpy and its temperature for some PCMs.\nPCMs are used in residential buildings (with 40% energy consumption) and industrial silos and factories (with 55% energy consumption). Their importance will be doubled when we look at the role of recycling and optimization of energy consumption in energy management [41,42]. For example, the use of these materials in the eastern and western walls leas to the energy-saving about 29% and the northern and southern walls of a residential home result in energy-saving about 19% [43]. In Fig. 3, heat transfer is plotted for buildings.\nThe main purposes of using PCMs in buildings are: using the sun’s natural heat for cooling and heating and using the heat stored by the heating and cooling systems. There are three general ways to use PCMs to research these goals: using PCMs on the building wall, using PCMs on ceilings and floors, using them in cold and hot storage tanks, reduce indoor temperature fluctuations, using PCMs in solar systems, and their application in textiles.\nThe use of PCM in the building (Fig. 4) can include PCM shutters, PCM layer in facing walls, floor heating systems and PCM roof\narious sources in the US in 2009 [27,28].\nboards. By placing the PCM on the suspended ceiling, they are used as part of air conditioning systems. The use of PCM inwalls not only makes them lighter but also saves energy by reducing thermal loads [46,47]. These materials are usually made from hydrocarbons or hydrated salts that are used in combination with ferrous additives to increase the thermal conductivity [48,49].\nRadiation heat transfer from the floor is better than convection heat transfer because of providing more appropriate heating and less space occupancy. By utilizing PCM in the floor materials and by assuming electrical heating, the electrical energy consumption can be reduced. In this way, at night when power consumption is less, the PCM material is melted and stores the heat as the electrical system is turned on. The heat is returned to the environment during the day leads to savings in power consumption and the creation of balance in power generation of power plants [50].\nThe increasing demand for energy consumption and the limitation of fossil fuels as running out of resources and increasing environmental pollutants make the issue of energy storage is of paramount importance. About 40% of all energy is consumed in the buildings such that 14% of which is consumed in space heating and cooling. The first reports of the use of these materials in the building emerged from the 1940s. Then, the use of these materials in buildings has been extensively studied since the 1980s, and today their use in the building industry has been increased considerably [51]. The use of PCMs is an effective energy-saving approach sorted as renewable energy sources. During the melting\nprocess, the PCMs behave like a thermal battery with the capacity of latent heat and store the heat energy and release it during freezing. Considering the breadth and importance of PCMs in renewable and sustainable energy, this paper first provides a detailed illustration of phase change materials and their working principle, different types, and properties. Then a characteristic example of PCMs in solar energy storage and the design of PCMs are reviewed and analyzed. Next, this paper focuses on the heat transfer, melting and freezing processes of PCM/nano-PCMS including different models and experimental research on the natural convection and thermal energy storage. Finally, some challenges and suggestions are presented following the conclusion of this article."

      "heading" : "2. Aim of the present study",
      "text" : "The most prominent feature of PCMs is the potential for thermal energy storage, as these materials, like a heat sink absorbs lot of energy at a constant temperature. Thermal conductivity is a property attributed to thermal energy transfer capability, and its low content will reduce the storage potential. Therefore, researchers have always sought to apply techniques to improve heat transfer rates inside PCMs. Installing fins, loading metal foams and using pin-fins are some of the techniques that have received a lot of thoughtfulness. On the other hand, today’s technology has led to more nanoparticles (these materials have very high thermal\nconductivity) being produced at a lower cost. Adding nanoparticles can improve the heat transfer rate within the PCMs. Because these materials have very low thermal resistance and can be used as a path with low thermal resistance to transfer thermal energy. However, these substances also affect the viscosity and exacerbate the viscous force. On the other hand, convection in the liquid PCM depends on the buoyancy as well as viscous forces. Adding nanoparticles intensifies buoyancy force while also exacerbating viscous force. Therefore, adding nanoparticles has a positive effect and a negative effect. In this paper, the competition between positive/ negative effects is analyzed in different applications. In other studies [52], researchers have focused more on changes in thermophysical properties caused by the presence of nanoparticles. But in this study, the main focus is on the analysis of the melting and freezing phenomena in the presence of nanoparticles. Moreover, more comprehensive study is conducted to assess the nano-PCM applications."

      "heading" : "3. PCMs and their different types",
      "text" : "PCMs are organic or inorganic compounds that absorb large amounts of heat energy. Thermal energy storage in these materials occurs during the phase change process. These materials absorb and give back the thermal energy to the environment when the solid to liquid and liquid to solid phase change occurs, respectively. The PCMs have the potential to retain latent heat energy without any change even after thousands of phase change cycles [53]. When they are used indoors, they exchange large amounts of heat with the environment through consecutive cycles of melting and freezing due to extreme changes in air temperature (e.g. between night and day), providing a more balanced air temperature for indoors [54].\nAnother application of PCMs is in food transport equipment and machinery. Food transportation is one of the most difficult tasks in the freight industry. Foods often cannot last long under normal conditions due to the possibility of spoilage and deformation. Besides, transportation of some foods to distant places is somewhat impossible. On the other hand, the difference between night and creating of a constant temperature in the cabin of PCMs in different days and various environments are difficult. Today, a variety of trucks equipped with refrigerators and freezers is produced based on the advancement in the science and achievement of various mechanical and thermodynamic knowledge, including the use of PCMs [55,56]. For example, Fig. 5 shows that a system can adjust the temperature of food throughout the journey.\nNumerous studies were conducted to reveal the successive usage of PCMs in buildings and the reduction of energy consumption for heating and cooling as well as providing comfort conditions to the residents [59,60]. According to the results of the application of these materials in the building, the fluctuations of indoor air temperature are significantly reduced and it is easy to maintain the proper ambient temperature at optimum body temperature [61]. PCMs are special cases of the solid-liquid state which are solutions used to control heat and received the attention of many researchers in the last decades because of the latent heat for solid-to-solid or liquid-to-liquid cases are less than that for solid-to-liquid (melting) case. As shown in Fig. 6, these materials are categorized in three classes of organic, inorganic, and eutectic [62,63].\nOnce a solid is heated, it absorbs energy to reach its melting point and then changes from solid to liquid. PCMs have the property of changing their phase at a given temperature range, in the sense that they maintain their temperature during the phase change [65]. In fact, they are heated in parallel with the environment during the heating process until they reach their melting temperature (phase change). After reaching this temperature,\nalthough the ambient temperature continues to increase, the temperature of the materials and their surrounding environment remain constant and resist temperature rise due to the changing phase [66]. During this period, which usually lasts several hours, PCMs absorb large amounts of ambient heat but do not spend it for increasing their temperature [67,68]. During the phase change process (Fig. 7), they maintain their and surrounding temperature (see Fig. 8).\nMost common PCMs in industries have low thermal conductivity, leading to a reduction in the efficiency of some systems that use these materials for energy storage. As a result, such systems face inappropriate economic justification. Various techniques are used for the improvement of such energy storage systems. These techniques are: using extended surfaces (fins) [71,72], using a network of PCMs with several materials [72e74], microcapsules PCMs [75e77], and increasing thermal conductivity of PCMs [78]. Because of their higher thermal conductivity and lower density, fiber filters and carbon nanomaterials are the two most common components used to improve their thermal conductivity [79,80]. Carbon materials have high resistance against chemical reactions and corrosion, making them compatible in every situation. By and large, fibers or carbon fibers can be added to the PCMs by melting and shear mixing techniques [81]."

      "text" : "Organic materials are divided into two groups of paraffin and non-Paraffins. Organic materials with homogeneous melting, coreforming, as well as materials used as coatings are not corrosive. The organic PCMs used for heating and cooling of buildings have a melting point of 20e32 C.\nOrganic PCMs include paraffin and non-paraffins. Paraffin is a compound of straight chains. Due to availability of Paraffin in a wide range of melting temperatures, it is one of the best choices as a PCM for energy storage. Due to economic considerations, only industrial-purity paraffin can be used as PCM in latent thermal storage systems. Paraffin is safe, reliable, predictable, non-corrosive and cheap. Paraffin is chemically neutral and stable at temperatures below 500 C. In addition to the above properties, homogeneous melting and core-forming are two important characteristics of paraffin. Paraffin has drawbacks such as low conductivity, flammability, and incompatibility with the plastic case, although these drawbacks can be corrected with some changes in paraffinwax and storage unit [83e89].\nNon-paraffins contain a large number of matters with variable properties. Some researchers have done extensive research on organic matter and eventually considered esters, fatty acids, alcohol, and glycol for energy storage. High latent heat, flammability, low conductivity, low ignition point, different toxicity and incompatibility at high temperatures are among the characteristics of non- Paraffins [90e94]."

      "heading" : "4.2. Inorganic PCMs",
      "text" : "Inorganic materials are classified into salt and metal hydrates. Inorganic compounds have a high latent heat per mass and volume, they are cost-effective, inexpensive and non-flammable in comparison with organic compounds. However, these materials have some issues like undercooling and separation (which affect the\nproperties of the phase change). The general principle of salt hydrates is as follows. The solidliquid phase change of salt hydrates is, in fact, the dehydration. Salt hydrates are a very important group of PCMs that have the following characteristics: High latent heat per volume, relatively high thermal conductivity, Low volume changes during melting, toxicity, homogenous melting, the density difference with water (which causes it to be deposited at the end of the case) and the formation of a weak core that causes under cooling [95e99].\nMetal hydrates includes metals with a low melting point and eutectic metals. Due to the weight problem, these metals are not widely used. High latent heat per volume and high thermal conductivity are among the properties of these materials [100e102].\nEutectics are a minimum-melting of two or more components composition, each of which freeze and melts correspondingly creating a mixture of the component crystals through crystallization (Fig. 7). The coordinates that determine a eutectic point on the phase diagram are the ratio of the eutectic percentage (on the axis\nof atomic/molecular ratio) and the eutectic temperature (on the axis of temperature) [103e105].\nAccording to the explanations given above and the types of PCMs and based on Fig. 9 in which some PCMs and their thermal conductivity values are given, it can be observed that PCMs are divided into three categories in terms of application in different temperature ranges: low temperature, medium temperature and high temperature, which can be used in the construction industry, pharmaceutical, textile, electronics, solar collectors, and solar power plants, respectively."

      "heading" : "5. Properties of PCMs",
      "text" : "According to the performance of PCMs, as shown in Fig. 10, energy storage systems must have the following attributions: i) suitable melting point at optimum temperature range, ii) enough surface of heat transfer, and iii) suitable enclosure compatible with of PCMs. The implementation of energy storage systems is often not economically feasible due to their more complex performance than conventional HVAC systems, as well as the need to use specialized and skilled personnel in the design and installation process [109e112]. Thus, the use of these systems in energy evaluation of buildings is considered when the following conditions are met in the building: the calculated maximum thermal loads are significantly greater than its averaged value. The building locates in a place with high-temperature differences during a day. This is\nespecially true in desert cities with hot days and cold nights. Using energy-saving systems in buildings is more cost-effective than purchasing energy-generating equipment such as boilers and chillers. The price of electricity consumed during the peak hours of the network is very different from other hours. The amount of electricity provided by the network is limited and the addition of the transformer requires a great deal of cost [113,114]. This is especially true in large industrial plants, commercial and residential buildings located in hot and humid regions that their electrical energy consumption is high enough to supply a cold load.\nAll human efforts in air conditioning are providing conditions wherein human comfort in the living environment. These efforts are accompanied not only by high costs and the consumption of fossil fuels but also results in environmental pollution and wiping out the energy sources. Energy consumption management in buildings is one of the ways to reduce energy consumption and environmental pollutants [65,115e117]. PCMs and energy storage systems are among the things that have become increasingly important in recent years in energy management in buildings. Storing the energy during unnecessary hours in walls and using them during peak hours is a promising approach. The sun, as an endless source, is of great importance in the field of renewable energies. The most suitable areas to use this energy are near the equator, where solar energy is the highest. Due to the great climate change in the world, the use of these systems can greatly save energy, reduce pollution caused by fossil fuels and decline heating\ncosts. On the other hand, as most desert regions have hightemperature differences during the day and night, this type of storage system can be used to absorb cooling energy in buildings and reduce electricity consumption [118e123]. In Fig. 11 a, b, applications of PCMs in a cooling system and a building wall, respectively.\nThe PCMs used in the heat storage scheme must have appropriate chemical, kinetic and thermophysical properties, as illustrated in Fig. 12.\nConsidering the investigations and properties of PCMs (Fig. 13), the use of organic PCMs is the most commonly used [83,84,88,123].\nPCMs can be used in the three forms of raw material, micro, and macro. Since the application of these materials as rawmaterials can have disadvantages depending on PCM types and also due to their probability to flow in the liquid phase, the enclosures are required for keeping them in the liquid phase (Figs. 14 and 15). Therefore, they are usually used as packages of both micro and macro types in different industries [85e87,126].\nTo produce both micro and macro types, the PCMs are embedded in the enclosures and encapsulated. Hence, the major difference between the twomicrocapsules andmicrocapsules is the size of the enclosures or capsules used. In the microcapsule method, the material is embedded in tiny spheres with a diameter of 1e30 mm. In the microcapsule method (Figs. 16e18), materials are embedded in larger containers in envelopes or containers of different materials. Most of these containers are made of plastic bags as well as high-density polyethylene hard panels [128e133]."

      "heading" : "6. Solar energy storage using PCMs",
      "text" : "Along with the growing development of solar power plants, thermal systems such as receivers, collectors, and thermal energy storage have developed. Thermal systems are an important part of solar power plants. Fig. 19 shows the components used in a solar power plant and energy storage [136,137]. Thermal energy storage\nis defined by the world energy agency as a device, something like a thermal battery, to store thermal energy in a tank for demand in another time for heating and cooling or power generation. Half of the accumulated energy is consumed as thermal energy. Since heat demand may vary throughout the day and from day to day, energy storage is used to balance energy demand during the day, week and even a season. Energy storage has a vital effect on reducing the peak of greenhouse gas emissions and has the potential to increase the efficiency of energy systems, either. Energy storages are especially useful for power and heat production in-home applications. Figs. 20 and 21 illustrate the use of thermal storage for home heating [138,139]. According to these applications, the storage must have the following properties [140,141] high ratio of volume to cost, high ratio of absorption to rejection capacity, durability and long life.\nThe results dealing with the application of using PCMs in thermal storages shows that energy consumption declines in some cases, even up to 22%, especially during peak hours of energy consumption. The benefits of using these materials in buildings can be related to the increased thermal comfort of residents following the reduction of temperature fluctuations. Also, another advantage of using this method is the reduction of severe temperature fluctuations in sensitive cases such as the temperature of greenhouses, solar heaters, and dryers which can affect the desired quality of the finished product [147,148]."

      "heading" : "7. Design of thermal energy storage",
      "text" : "It is easily understood that the liquid-solid phase change problems are more relevant than the liquid-gas and solid-gas phase changes because they have a higher thermal density. Figure (22) illustrates the preparation stages of the PCMs according to the work of Qian et al. [123].\nHowever, several parameters must be considered by designers. In addition to technical features, as shown in Fig. 23, the productions must be affordable, environmental issues should be taken\ninto account, also thermal properties such as sensible and latent heat capacities have an essential impact on the size reduction and efficiency improvement. The heat transfer rate must be as much as possible to meet the thermal requirements during the absorption and rejection cycles [150e153]. On the other hand, the materials of the storage must be chemically and mechanically stable against successive thermal cycles. Also, the storage must be compatible with the operating fluid [154e156].\nThe constituent materials of the storage are different because the storage method is sensible, latent, and chemical. Sensible heat is the heat that causes temperature changes in the material. In thermal energy storage due to sensible heat, adding or removing energy from the energy storage material leads to an increase or decrease in its temperature. Thermal energy storage due to chemical reaction is another optimal method for storing thermal energy using the heat generated by chemical reactions. Thermal energy Storage due to latent heat includes the addition (or rejection) of thermal energy as latent heat to (or from) the body. As a result, the process of phase change occurs in the material. One of the features of this storage method is the ability to store energy in a volume much lower than the energy storage method due to sensible heat, which can be considered the most suitable method of energy storage if the space is limited and the system weight is maximum. PCMs used as latent storage in heating systems can absorb or release large amounts of heat during the phase change\nprocess such as melting-freezing or distillation-evaporation [158e164].\nCryogenic energy storage systems are often divided into two categories: full and partial capacity storages. In the former case, the total required cold load is transferred to the non-peak time period during peak consumption. In other words, during non-peak hours inwhich the demand cost decreases, chillers operate at full capacity and store the cooling energy generated inside the system in the freezing process. During the day and during the time when electricity consumption is maximized and the cost of demand is high, the cooling generating system is switched off and the total cooling load required by the system is obtained by melting the phase change materials. It is mostly used when the peak period of consumption of the electricity distribution network is short or the cost of electricity consumption at peak times is high [165e169]. It should be noted that this system is also capable of providing cooling of the space when emergency power is cut off (Fig. 24).\nIn partial capacity storage systems, the chiller provides part of the maximum cold load required by the system and the rest is provided by the energy storage system. These types of systems can be implemented in both constant and variable load methods. In the first method, the chiller operates at full capacity for 24 h a day. In this case, if the load is greater than the capacity of the chiller, the overload will be provided by storage systems. When the required cooling load is low, the excess cooling generated by chiller is sent to\nstorage systems to be stored. In this type of system, the capacity of the chiller and the storage system is minimum (Fig. 25). In the second method, the energy storage system provides most of the required cooling load. The chiller operates with full capacity during non-peak hours and the cold produced is stored in the energy storage system. The partial capacity system is drawn in Fig. 26, schematically [141]."

      "heading" : "8. Nanoparticles and heat transfer enhancement",
      "text" : "Evaluation of the thermal properties of cooling liquids shows poor heat conductivity (except for liquid metals, which are not useable in most temperature ranges). For example, the thermal conductivity of water is about 30% of copper. It is clear that all works to enhance heat transfer by turbulence, surface enhancement, etc. are limited by natural limitations of thermal conductivity [172e174]. It is more than a century that the use of suspended solids mixtures has been proposed for the thermal conductivity enhancement. Maxwell [175] was the founder of establishing theories in predicting the thermal conductivity of suspendedmixtures. His attempts were followed up by many empirical studies and theories such as the works of Zhou [176], Xuan [177], Lee [178], and Das [179]. Further models presented in Refs. [180e183] were also\nused in predictions. Nevertheless, all of these researches are restricted to particle suspensions in micro and millimeter dimensions, and such suspensions result in the following drawbacks [184e187]: The fast particles settle, making layers on surfaces, and decreasing the capacity of heat transfer. Sedimentation decreases as a response to a rise of chaotic fluid motion but corrosion of heat transfer devices, pipes, etc. rises speedily. The tendency for clogging increases along the channel flow path with the particle size. The pressure drop in the fluid augments substantially. Therefore, the path of particle formation in the fluid was well defined but not generally acceptable for heat transfer applications [188e192]. New material technology has developed the chance to create nano-sized particles that are completely different in optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties.\nChoi et al. [193] introduced the idea of dispersing nano-sized particles into a liquid. To increase the heat transfer, the researchers added nanoparticles (particles smaller than 100 nm) to the fluid. This augmentation technique has previously been used with fluid-suspended microparticles to increase heat transfer in micro- and milli-channels. The surface-to-volume ratio of nanoparticles is 1000 times larger than micro-particles and can transfer heat greatly more efficiently. Choi et al. [193] showed that the addition of nano-additives to the common fluids could double the\nheat transfer rate of those fluids due to the higher thermal conductivity of these particles. What makes the nanoparticles attractive as a potential candidate for making a mixture of particles with fluids is providing a large area for heat transfer, the momentum of the particles is low, and they have high mobility.\nHaq et al. [194] investigated thermal management in singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/water nanofluid (Fig. 27). In this study, thermal conductivity was improved by heating\nboundary conditions and the presence of SWCNT in the enclosure. Three different conditions (cold, hot and adiabatic) were used at the walls. This phenomenon is governed by nonlinear partial differential equations including continuity, momentum, and energy. The numerical solution method was the FEM to study the influences of cylinder conditions (hot, cold and adiabatic), heated zone length (A LH B), Rayleigh number (104 Ra 108), nanofluid concentration (0 ¼ ɸ 0.2), and the magnetization value (0 ¼ M 500) on the flow rate, and temperature distribution. The results showed that as the Ra and ɸ increase, this amount of heat transfer rate increases. Also, the thermal distribution increases as ɸ increases. In contrast, thermal distribution does not change with the magnetization.\nWhen particles are dispersed properly, these nanofluid properties are predictable to have the following advantages.\ni) Greater thermal conductivity: The nanoparticles higher surface area causes more heat transfer. 20% of nanoparticle atoms are on their surface for those smaller than 20 nm. This specificationmakes them accessible for heat exchange at any time. One more benefit is the mobility of the nanoparticles due to their small size, which can create micro-displacements and thus increase heat transfer [195e202].\nii) Stability: Since the particles are small, they have low weight, leading to a small tendency for settling. This reduction in sedimentation overcomes one of the major weaknesses of suspended mixtures (particle deposition) and makes nanofluids more stable [203e206].\niii) Micro-channel cooling without blockage: nanofluids are also\nsuitable for working in microchannel where they are exposed to great heat loads. The grouping of nanofluids and microchannels provides both high conductivity fluid and high heat transfer rate. Nanoparticles are much smaller than microchannels and do not cause clogging [207e209].\niv) Reduced corrosion probability: the size of the nanoparticles is very small and consequently their momentum effect on solid walls is very low, resulting in a reduction in the corrosion of pipelines, heat exchangers and pumps, to name a few [210,211].\nThe nanoparticles are classified into three categories of ceramics, puremetals, and carbon nanotubes, whichwill be discussed in more details. The various combinations of these nanoparticles and the base fluids including water, ethylene glycol, oils, and\ntoluene provide different nanofluids [212e214]. Although conventional PCMs are usually high in density, their low melting, and freezing rates reduce the potential of energy storage systems in specific applications. This is because almost all conventional PCMs have low thermal conductivity, although their values are increased by the use of high conductivity materials in various methods [215e219]. These methods are.\ni) the saturation/distribution of high thermal conductivity porous materials/particles within PCMs,\nii) embedding metal compounds and structures in PCMs, and iii) using low-density high conductivity materials.\nAlthough the use of graphite composite in PCMs improves their performance, some limitations have led researchers to look for other solutions. These limitations correspond to the production process of graphite composites which is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, some researchers have been looking for a solution to this problem in recent years. They found that by adding highconductive particles with micro- and nano-scale to the PCM, its thermodynamic properties are enhanced, leading to an increase in system efficiency. The embedded metal structure in the PCMs has been proposed as a technique to increase its thermal conductivity. In this technique, a metal sphere or a cylindrical tube (or other shapes) is used and placed in the PCM enclosure, which dramatically reduces the phase change time, as a consequence, its efficiency is increased (Fig. 28). High-density metal particles and compounds may sediment in the system and also increase the\nweight of the system significantly. In addition, researchers showed that the compatibility with PCMs is not the intrinsic features for all metals. For instance, nickel is not compatible with paraffin, while aluminum particles are. These issues have led researchers to seek for high thermal conductivity, low-density materials which are broadly compatible [220e227].\nSince carbon fiber density is lower than that of metals and its thermal conductivity is approximately equivalent to that of copper and aluminum, its use is promising to increase the efficiency of energy storage systems. In addition, carbon fiber has corrosion resistance and is therefore compatible with most PCMs. It is important to consider the uniform distribution of carbon fiber particles. Studies showed that systems in which carbon fiber particles are uniformly distributed in the PCM exhibit much more efficiency than that they are distributed randomly and non-\nuniformly. Previous studies demonstrated that nanoparticles are most commonly used in paraffin PCMs [228e234]."

Therefore, six steps are required to complete the thermal process. At each particular stage, heat transfer occurs as convection and conduction [251]. In\nthis case, predicting the spatial motion of the melting front over time because it is nonlinear and moving; moreover, the heat transfer involves free convection and conduction. Because of these three factors, the governing equations at the interface are nonlinear. Thus, there is an exact solution to some problems. Alexiades [252] showed that there are many physical phenomena that occur during phase change, including the changes in the specific heat, volume, thermal conductivity, density, and over-cooling, which should be considered in the study of phase change using mathematical models. Due to the complexity of the subject, various methods have been proposed over the years to model and predict the melting and freezing phase change process. An overview of these methods is presented here.\nExperimental methods are more accurate to exhibit the actual behavior of the phase change phenomena than numerical studies since the behavior of the phase change phenomena is examined directly by observation with no assumptions. However, in many areas such as large-scale and unsteady environments, experimental methods cannot be used. The properties of the experimental methods can be categorized as follows [252]: i) they consume a\ngreat deal of time and expense, ii) the dimensions of the laboratory equipment should be appropriately selected according to the type of experiment. On the other hand, the space in which the equipment is located should also be selected according to these dimensions, iii) the equipment needed must be properly assembled, iv) appropriate environmental variables should be considered to simulate actual conditions, v) variation of variables must be accurately measured by calibrated devices.

Using the enthalpy method, a two-phase region called mushy region is considered, which avoids the severe discontinuity due to numerical instability. This method was reported that is consistent with the practical problems because it\ndoes not need to explicitly examine the phase change boundary [260].\nThe basic enthalpy approach can be explained as a conductioncontrolled transition in one-dimensional. The conservation energy is stated using enthalpy and total volume temperature in the phasechange procedure, through which a continuous function is obtained.

      "heading" : "11. Melting and freezing of PCMs and nano PCMs",
      "text" : "The first studies on rectangular geometry were performed in 1975 and 1976 by Shamsundar and Sparrow [264e266] through the use of FDM. Hamdan and Elwerr [267] proposed a model for studying the melting process in a cavity. The melting rate was\nlargely dependent on thermal diffusion, adhesion, thermal conductivity, specific heat, and latent heat. Using the energy balance, Lacroix [268] provided a mathematical model to investigate the\ncontact melting of PCMs in a square cavity containing free convection. The results of this numerical study showed that the melt volume at the bottom of the cavity is greater than that of the case in which pure conduction is dominant. Free convection effect has been studied by Lamberg and Siren [269] to analytically discover how the melting front behaves in a semi-infinite PCM cavity with the presence of fins. This analytical model involves the solution of the Neumann equation, in a pure conduction problem. They also estimated the location of the melting zone using the exact solution of the Newman equation. A similar study was performed by\nLamberg et al. [270] in the presence and absence of free convection and a comparison was made against experiments. The results showed that ignoring the natural convection effect doubled the time of the maximum temperature. The spatio-temporal variation of the interface during the melting process in a rectangular cavity has been obtained by Stritih [271] experimentally and compared against analytical results. The results showed that analytical results accurate just in the acute response. But, the difference between the results increases considerably with the melting time. A cylinder\nengulfed by hot water was studied by Regin et al. [272] to capture the melting front of paraffin capsules. The melting process was higher in the upper part of the cylinder than in the lower part of the cylinder. Also, free convection has a deep influence on the coincidence of the numerical and experimental results. The PCM-filled cylinder with heated-sidewall, shown in Fig. 38, was studied by Jones et al. [273]experimentally and numerically. Their results indicated that the melting layer along the vertical direction uniformly varies in the early stages. The thickness of the melting layer changes with time similar to the rectangular enclosure. This indicates the dominance of natural convection.\nMelting of paraffin in a cylinder was studied by Akgün et al. [274]. They observed that the melted PCM expanded radially outward and forms a conical shape. Bahrami [275] performed experimental studies on PCMmelting in a sphere. The dome shape of the solid-liquid intermediate plate with higher at the top persists during melting process. Also, the solid PCM moves downward due to its higher density than liquid PCM and settled down to the bottom of the spherical cavity. Akhilesh et al. [276] numerically studiedmelting in a rectangular enclosurewith a heated upper wall (Fig. 39). This analysis involved examining the number of fins per unit length, leading to a rise in heat transfer and energy storage. They found that attaching more fins could not increase thermal efficiency significantly.\nGharebaghi and Sezai [277] investigated the efficiency of rectangular cavities with the presence of horizontal and vertical fins. In both cases, the heated wall was kept at a fixed temperature above the PCM melting temperature. The heat transfer rate is raised by attaching fins horizontally for the differentially heated sidewalls. Moreover, raising the distance between fins rises the heat transfer rate. It was also found that increasing the number of fins more than a certain amount results in a slight increase in the heat transfer. Declining the buoyancy effect, leading to the dominance of the conduction heat transfer mechanism. The phase change of a finattached enclosure shown in Fig. 40 has been studied by Lacroix and Benmadda [278]. This study investigated the effect of the number and length of fins on PCM melting rate. For short fins, the melting rate depended on the number of fins. They found that the melt front passing through the fins is almost similar to the case without fins. On the flip side, melting rate constantly increased with the fins number. The results also showed that at high\ntemperature difference, raising the fins number raises the heat transfer rate. They revealed that the optimal number of fins is also affected by the temperature of the hot wall. The research has been developed by Lamberg et al. [270] and Lamberg [279] to compare three configurations of no fin, single fin, and twin fin. These studies revealed that the heat transfer rate of the twin fin configuration is higher than a single fin, followed by the no fin system.\nFin thickness was studied by Shatikian et al. [280,281]. For the same sizes of rectangular cavities, the melting rate of the thicker case is slower than the thinner ones. Also, in thicker cavities, the fluid movement becomes more with the melting process time. On the other hand, in thin cavities, the fluid moves slowly in the\nmelting process. Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage (LHTES) was proposed by Deng et al. [282] with new positioning and shape of fins. These fins were tested in the lower half of the cavity and mirror positions relative to the centerline of the tube. An unsteady 2D numerical test was performed on the Luric acid melting process as PCM. The pair fins were used in the experimental test at the angles of 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , and 180 . The results showed that at angles of 30 e120 are optimal to achieve complete melting time. Increasing the inclination angle, up to 120 , increases the heat transfer rate. In addition, it was found that by increasing the fin length, the LHTES role could be significantly improved rather than the base state. As the melting process continues, natural heat transfer dominates. This factor is such that a hole is created in the shell of the cavity. Two fins in the down hemisphere with an angle of 120 led to maximum natural heat transfer. It increases by increasing the fin length.\nBlade embedding is an effective method to enhance heat transfer between PCM and heat transfer fluid (HTF). A proper arrangement of blades can play an important role in LHTES. Deng et al. [283] defined a two-dimensional model based on finite volume method (FVM) concerning natural heat transfer and found the effective order in the arrangement of the fins used in the design for charge rate in LHTES. They compared the results with experimental data (Fig. 41). First, the heat transfer characteristics of the LHTES unit were investigated by arranging different fins. These models include non-fin pair of tubes, pair of tubes with straight fins, pair of tubes with angular fins, pair of tubes with fins in lower hemisphere, and pair of tubes with fins in upper hemisphere. Then, the effect of the number of blades (N), dimensionless fin length (L), heat transfer fluid temperature (Tw) and outer tubematerials on themelting and fusion were studied for four models. Then, the best type of fin arrangement was proposed to increase thermal efficiency. Increasing the capability of the LHTES unit by applying the position\nof the fins quantitatively based on the full melting time and heat storage capacity was described and the following results were obtained: The number of optimal fins is N 6. When angular fins are used N > 6. For N ¼ 6 only the length of the fins (L) can change the optimal value. In the case of angular fins, the optimal value of L is 0.5 and 0.95. At L ¼ 0.75, the optimal value is minimum. In the first 40 s of the melting process, it was observed that the melting process is due to the natural heat transfer. Finally, Deng et al. [283] studies the role of natural convective heat transfer in PCM melting by defining different models of the fins’ arrangement immersed in lauric acid. Based on the experimental data and simulation results, it is concluded that the area with the least volume fraction of melt can be moved and the melting time of PCM can be changed depending on the position of the fins in the enclosure. However, comparing the finned and unfinnedmodels, it is concluded that the charge rate in the unfinned model is higher than that of the finned ones due to the maximum melting time of PCM and thus trapping more heat energy due to natural convection heat transfer.\nPoran and Ahmed [284]performed a two-dimensional model of PCM melting in the enclosure using ANSYS software. Seven different shapes of cavity and heat source were tested and a well agreement was reported against experiments. The results showed that heat source shape has a deep effect on the PCM melting process than the enclosure shape. It was then observed that the circular heat source improves the PCM melting process under adiabatic boundary condition. The melting efficiency of the circular source in the circular enclosure increases from 60% to 97%. So, if the heat source is covered by the PCM with the desired melting point may be useful in the process of heat rejection in electronic machines or other devices.\nBouhal et al. [285] investigated two-dimensional numerical analysis of solid gallium melts on porosity-enthalpy formulation to optimize the mold geometry (Fig. 42). The effects of geometry on PCM melting were investigated. Two designs were proposed, simple design and the one with 4 fins, which reduced the melting time from 18.35 to 13.35 min. In other words, the fins improve heat transfer and melting time.\nPourakabar and Darzi [286] studied the melting of PCMs in enclosures with different inner tube arrangements. Nine different cavities were examined. Their temperature was assumed to be constant and their walls were adiabatic. It was found that in early times, conduction heat transfer is the dominant mechanism. Then, the natural convection increases the melting process, especially the upper part is more affected. The lowest and the highest melting rates are associated with the dual tube and the single tube configurations. Also, the fastest and the slowest freezing times are allocated with the diamond arrangement and the dual-tube configuration. Injecting copper foam into the PCM acts as a catalyzer. It was reported that the temperature of the PCM varies slower than the metal foam. In addition, injecting metal foams almost doubled the melting and freezing rates.\nWang et al. [287] used a square cube cavity and studied various\nmetal foams combined with paraffin and other materials to make composite materials to determine effective heat transfer and thermophysical properties. A WeP model was used for the simulation of melting foam at a constant temperature using a combination of 6 types of tetradecahedron and two types of irregular dodecahedron. It was reported that the thermophysical properties of the metal foam and the PCM have a profound effect on the heat transfer of PCM composites when the porosity size has no considerable effect. The effective heat transfer of the PCM composite increases with the increase in heat transfer of the metal foam, which becomesmore andmore in its lower porosity. The effective thermal conductivity of PCM composites depends on the ratio of the metal conductivity to the conductivity of PCM. The melting front is highly affected by the metal foam microstructure and most of the heat transfer occurs in the liquid phase. While the porous structure is influenced by conduction rather than convection such that the thermal conductivity and the temperature are the most effective factors. The growth of the fluid phase varies non-linearly over time. The melting rate is very high in later stages but gradually decreases with time. In other words, the natural heat transfer is suppressed and conductive heat transfer is raised by increasing the percentage of porous materials in the composite.\nBondareva and Sheremet [288] simulated this process numerically. In this study, the two opposite walls had low heat transfer and the other walls were insulated with the bottom-attached heater. The governing equations were formulated non-dimensionally. The finite difference method was used. The distribution of velocity and temperature for different values of Ra and dimensionless time led to the understanding of flow patterns and heat transfer within the enclosure. It was observed that for the average values of the Rayleigh number, single thermal plume can be considered. For high values of Rayleigh number, double thermal plume is observed. The evolution of the phase-change process is a function of the mode of thermal plume and heating not only vertically but also horizontally. At high values of the Rayleigh number, rapid asymmetric development was observed. In the two-dimensional enclosure model, the process of melting was carried out rapidly, while the cooling of the material is a characteristic of the cubic cavities.\nThe natural heat transfer of paraffin melt in a cubic and rectangular cavity with a local heat source located on its bottom was studied by Bondareva and Sheremet [289] numerically. The governing equations were formulated in non-dimensional form. The potential-vortex equations and the flow-vortex equation have been solved through the use of the FDM for three- and two-dimensional simulations, respectively. Comparison between two- and threedimensional cases showed that the occurrence of melting is difficult in the early stages in the two-dimensional model. However, it changes with time. Themelting process is more concentrated in the 3D model but in weaker heat transfer compared to the 2D model.\nDifferent boundary conditions of the heat source have been studied by Kant et al. [290] numerically. Firstly, a constant heat flux between 500 and 500 W/m2 is considered, and secondly, a\nsinusoidal function, similar to the previous one, were used for cooling and heating the PCM wall of the cavity. The results showed that the sinusoidal function performs better than the constant function in PCM melting and the melting time is less than the freezing time.\nFurther types of boundary conditions in the square TES cavity, shown in Fig. 43, has been studied by Satbhai et al. [291]. The simulations performed by solving governing equations using PISO algorithm over unstructured computational cells. This was done using the porous enthalpy model. In the bottom-heated cavity, maximum Nusselt number and little change in total entropy generation were reported compared to the other two models (left- and top-heatedmodels). The top-heatedmodel had the highest melting time compared to the other two models and the bottom-heated model had the highest Nusselt number (3.14). It was 13.47% and 36.14% for left- and upper heated surface, respectively. It was found that themelting time in the upper heatedwall model is about twice (FO ¼ 35.25) compared to other two models. A comparison of the three models in the mean entropy value showed that the bottomheated model has the highest mean entropy value. This value was 16.291 J/m3K. For up- and left-heated walls, a decrease of 0.6% and 0.08% was reported, respectively. The fastest melting with the highest Nu number is associated with the bottom-heated model and this was the best case for energy storage considering the Nusselt, Prandtl, Rayleigh numbers and entropy generation. Natural heat transfer was identified as a dominant heat transfer\nmechanism. As displayed, the natural convention at the top of the cavity is greater than that at the bottom of the enclosure. It was also observed that f and m of NEPCM are in a direct relationship, which is one of the negative effects of natural heat transfer. It was also found from diagram I that the PCM full melting time decreases by 29% and 34% by reducing the porosity from 1 to 0.95 and 0.9, respectively. However, from diagram II it can be seen that the complete melting time of the PCM with the porosity of 0.95 is delayed in comparison to the pure PCM, which is originated from the weakness of vortices in the porous PCM.\nZhao et al. [292] carried out a three-dimensional numerical study of PCM melting in a cubic enclosure. An enthalpy-based incompressible Thermal Lattice Boltzmann method (iTLBM) was applied for different heater positions. The results showed that the melting rate is profoundly affected by the heater size and its heat flux strength. Moving the heat flux from the two sides toward the center increases the heat flux rate and thus the melting rate. The change of the location of the heat source from the top to the bottom of the enclosure was found that has an increasing impact on thermal performance.\nTheir low heat transfer rates lead many efforts to increase the capability of PCM melting processes. Meanwhile, the design of a PCM cavity has also been employed to enhance natural heat transfer. Li et al. [293] explained the two-dimensional PCMmelting process in the walls of a semi-enclosure. They found that vertical adiabatic walls facing the heated wall inversely affected the heat\nsidered in Ref. [291].\ntransfer phenomenon. Thewalls are optimum as themelting flow is in front of them. The effect of other enclosure constraints including the upper and lower walls was also studied. They found that the inclination of the top wall outward generally leads to the acceleration in the heat transfer and heat energy storage during the melting the PCM. But, bottom wall inclination has a little effect. In this study, the Prandtl of 40, Stefan number of 0.33 and Rayleigh number of zero (pure conductivity), 105 and 107 were used. The bottom wall did not affect the upper region due to the buoyancy flow where the melting zone has a large effect. Therefore, it has little effect on PCM melting. Here, it is emphasized that the design of the enclosure should be in a manner that is more in line with natural heat transfer, not vice versa.\nCao et al. [294] investigated the temperature conditions of the enclosure by the deviation of the heat source relative to the center of the horizontal enclosure experimentally and numerically. In this study, the temperature variations in different locations of heat source were measured and numerical model was investigated. By increasing the amount of source deviation from the center, the thermal performance and the melting rate increased. The ideal sample with the best thermal performance (e ¼ 30 mm) was found to have a reduction of 57% in the PCMmelting time. As the Reynolds number increases, natural heat transfer enhances, so the liquid phase front moves faster. The Reynolds number and the ratio of out-of-center heat source have a direct effect on the melting rate.\nVogel and Thess [295] investigated the melting process of octadecane attached symmetrically on both sides in TES systems experimentally and numerically. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical melting model by experimental data. The numerical method that was used to calculate the fluid flow, temperature and phase area included two approaches: the first one uses variable thermophysical properties together with the VOFmethod that is allowed to have air distance over the PCM to consider its expansion. The second one uses Boussinesq approximation and constant thermophysical properties, which are solved in two or three dimensions. Comparison of these two methods showed about 4% downward deviation in the simulation results compared to the experimental results in thermal flow rate, liquid phase fraction and the temperature, i.e. the value of the simulation results was lower than that of experimental ones.\nAttaching fins is another approach to increase the heat transfer and rate of phase change in the enclosures. The number and length of fins were studied by Lacroix and Benmadda [296]. It was showed that a few long fins result in a higher melting rate than many short ones. Gharebaghi and Sezai [277] showed that vertical protrusions increase the melting rate. Woon-Shing [297] investigated the melting of paraffin and gallium PCMs in enclosures with different boundary conditions to provide a deep understanding of the phase change and natural convection at large Rayleigh numbers were studied using the porous enthalpy method. The authors proposed relationships for the Nusselt number and the melting volume fraction in terms of the dimensionless governing numbers such as the Fourier and Stefan numbers.\nUsing FVM and porous enthalpy approach, melting of gallium around a circular cylinder was numerically investigated by Mahdaoui et al. [298]. The results of flow and temperature fields during melting time were presented along with the Nu number. Also, the volume fraction of the liquid and rate of melting were measured with the time in various surface temperature and heat flux. The results of this study highlighted the role of conductive and convection heat transfer in the melting process. Conduction mode was found that plays a central role in heat transfer near the cylinder wall and as the time increases, the convection heat transfer becomes stronger. In addition, the conduction mechanism is dominant under the cylinder.\nUsing the enthalpy-based LBM, which provides the simplified style of the algebraic velocity distribution function, phase change procedurewas simulated by Jourabian et al. [299] with emphasis on the free convection. Boltzmann’s function, f (x,c,t), denotes the probability of a random particle being positioned at x at time t, moving at the velocity c. This theory may be derived from older theories, including the theory of marker-and-cell and particle tracking. This study was carried out at Stefan number of 10, Rayleigh number of 106, and at different inclination angles relative to the horizon ( 30 to þ30 ). Raising in the Rayleigh number results in a rise in the melting rate for all inclination angles. In addition, when the enclosure rotates counterclockwise, the convection effect is higher and when it rotates clockwise, the effect of thermal conductivity on melting is higher.\nZennouhi et al. [300] investigated the influence of the enclosure angle on melting (Fig. 44). They investigated the melting of gallium at different angles of the enclosure in two-dimensional simulations. They solved the natural convection while phase changing occurs using the FVM and the porous enthalpy technique. Validation of the numerical model was performed by previous numerical results. The results indicated that the melting rate increases by declining the inclination angle from 90 to 0 .\nKarami and Kamkari [301] investigated the effect of PCM buoyancy force due to the slope deflection on charge and discharge rates of heat source (Fig. 45). One and three fins in the rectangular enclosure from one side began to heat within the PCM material under 0 to 180 . Luric acid was used as PCM material. Numerical simulations under control volume operationwere also investigated on properties such as phase field, flow field, temperature distribution, heat transfer rate, and TES for different configurations. The results showed that the melting time is declined with the natural convection by increasing the deviation of the rectangular source. The maximum melting time decreases by 72% in the three-fin enclosure and 0 compared to the no-fin enclosure. The results showed that the enclosure with one fin is less time consuming than the onewith three fins. Finally, the inclination angle was found that has a raising effect on Nu number.\nSouayfane et al. [302] used the enthalpymethod and studied the phase changes to reveal the favorable impact of natural heat transfer on the thermal performance of PCM melting. In addition, short-wave radiation is also used as a heat source to solve the defined algorithm in the two-dimensional FVM fashion. A numerical platform has been developed for the melting simulation and compared against the available experiments and numerical studies. Then a simplified model was used to melt a type of fatty acid by a combination of natural heat transfer and radiation. This hybrid model was applied by the lattice Boltzmann-discrete ordinate method (LBM-DOM). The simplified suggestedmodel is handy with a higher simulation speed than the CFD and LBM-DOM models. Also, again approved that during the PCM melting process, natural heat transfer acts as a key parameter in raising the average liquid fraction and progressive melting position. Finally, shortwave radiation increases the average liquid fraction.\nThe effect of inclination angle on melting performance was checked studied by Kamkari and Groulx [303]. The lauric acid melting was investigated at 90 , 45 and 0 in various fins number. Interface movement varies noticeably with the angle and defined the vortex strength such that it was made clear that raising the inclination angle improves either configuration with and without fins. The heat transfer enhancement in the horizontal enclosure and the vertically-finned enclosure with 3 fins was compared with the no-fin vertical enclosure, i.e. this value was 115% and 56%, respectively. This behavior showed that an increase of inclination angle can be used instead of using more fins in the PCM melting process in horizontal enclosures. The horizontal enclosure with\nthree fins was revealed that has the highest thermal conductivity and thus the lowest melting time.\nThe instantaneous ice melting within a porous horizontal enclosuremade by nickel steel alloywith two vertical cylinders was studied by Jourabian et al. [304] (Fig. 46). In this paper, the enthalpy-based LBM with dual distribution function on representative elementary volume scale was used. Using porous materials in the base PCM makes the role of conduction dominant and suppressing the vortex strength. The porous model was compared with pure or non-porous PCMmodel. It was found that reducing porosity leads to a decline in the complete melting time and thermal storage capacity of the system. The rate of thermal conductivity was developed in the samples with the highest porosity. It was demonstrated that the pure PCM slowly melted from its top with increasing thermal resistance of the melted layer, leading to a delay in the complete melting of the PCM. By using nickel steel alloy porous matrix in the ice, the conduction heat transfer was dominant and the natural heat transfer flow was stopped. Reducing porosity resulted in a reduction in thermal storage capacity. The\nhighest porosity samples can be used to achieve the highest heat transfer efficiency in this thermal storage unit. The point to note is that as porosity increases, thermal storage capacity increases but natural heat transfer decreases.\nDuring PCM heat transfer in closed enclosures, natural heat transfer and contact melting act as key factors in heat transfer improvement. An improved Nusselt model for melting PCM melts in rectangular enclosures with different inclination angles was proposed by Zhao et al. [305]. This study was conducted for a 2D experimental model. The melting process of n-octadecane was recorded for square enclosures at different angles (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90) by a digital camera. In this method, the nondimensional height, liquid fraction, and complete melting time were determined. The dimensional height was consistent with the theoretical results and the fastest operation corresponded to 60 - cavity. Natural heat transfer played an essential role in enhancing heat transfer. The fastest melting is for the inclined models than that for horizontal and vertical ones.\nA model was developed by Ji et al. [306] to reveal the impact of fin inclination angles of 0 ,þ15 ,þ30 , 15 and 30 . It was found that the angle of 15 is the most suitable configuration for increasing natural heat transfer compared to the other 3 angles. In this model, there was a 23.8% increase in PCM melting time compared to straight fins. However, this time for the models with\nthe angles of þ15 and þ30 resulted in a reduction of 45.2% and 71.4%, respectively. In other words, the fin with the angle of 15 was found as an optimum value for PCMmelting rate and saving of 62.7% in melting time.\nUsing longitudinal arrangement of two fins, Ji et al. [307] numerically studied the improvement of a PCM-made TES unit. RT42 was used as PCM in a rectangular enclosure heated at a constant temperature of 70 C to absorb thermal energy. A transient numerical model was developed and the results were validated by natural heat transfer. It was concluded that the short fin embedded on the upper wall and the long fin on the lower wall melts PCM faster. The fin lengths ratio of 0.25 resulted in an enhancement of 25% in the PCM melting time. The optimum arrangement of fins was found for the storage improvement such that, the longer length of the upper fin and the shorter length of the lower one had an unfavorable effect. To study the underlying physics of how the system performance improves by in a special configuration of the fin pairs, the liquid fraction contours showed good behavior of the liquid PCM flow. It was observed that for the length ratio of lower than 1, the free heat transfer flow through the chaotic flow appeared to be quite effective. However, the flow motions guided by natural heat transfer due to the longitudinal ratios more than 1 become weaker. The length ratio of 0.25 showed the highest length of solid-melt interface among other ratios. The average Nusselt number in three stages were compared to show which mechanism is dominant. Further optimization studies showed that when the ratio of length decreases, the full melting time decreases. The solid phase melts by 40.5% faster than the case in which the fins are the same. The time ratio was also decreased by 45% by decreasing the inlet temperature from 70 C to 50 C.\nHong et al. [308] simulated the liquid-solid phase change of the PCM in a square enclosure with isothermal walls. The idea of rotating the enclosure during the melting process was suggested as a feasible way to increase the performance of the energy storage system. The porous enthalpy model was used for this purpose and the numerical model validated with the published papers. The maximum raise in the liquid fraction occurs mostly between 24.3% and 40% standard time units, compared to when the enclosure inversion operation was not performed. The rotated enclosure is the simplest way of increasing the phase change compared to the available methods. In addition, for cases where it is not possible to fully invert, it is recommended to incline the enclosure as far as possible. Good performance by inversion is generally because of the dominancy of the convection mode.\nLi et al. [309] compared the natural heat transfer of threemodels of different materials including MPCM slurry, MPCM particle and ordinary PCM (Fig. 47). This test was evaluated by three lower, upper and lateral walls of the enclosure. MPCM slurry exhibited the best thermal control among the three materials. Excluding the effect of natural heat transfer, MPCM slurry had the lowest surface heat when having the highest heat transfer. On the contrary, without fluid convection, the lowest heat transfer and the worst interfacial heat resistance were observed for MPCM particles. The highest increase in temperature gradient was observed for MPCM slurry, especially in the vicinity of the heat source. The highest internal heat distribution was seen from lower heating. MPCM slurry with the lowest MPCM distribution showed the lowest time to reach the melting temperature. The results showed that MPCM slurry exhibits the best thermal control among the two models because of the rise in natural convection. Pure PCM and MPCM particles were placed in second and third place, respectively.\nInaba et al. [310] used a blend of fatty microparticles for their experiments: water, surfactants, and fine particles PCM. The PCM volume concentration ranges from a maximum 30% to the minimum 5% and the experiments were in three separate temperature\nphases of the PCM particles within the solid phase, two-phase, and liquid phase. The influence of rectangular enclosure size ratio and PCM concentration on natural heat transfer was examined. They revealed that the Nu value increases partially in the concentration of PCM in the solid phase. The Nusselt number was increased by increasing the concentration of PCM volume at low Ra. No significant difference was observed in PCM free convection in its low concentrations (<10mass%), while it became larger with raising the concentration. Even for low concentrations of PCM, the maximum Nusselt number was reported that has a direct relation with Ra within the phase change region. Scattering of fatty particles had an effect on enhancing natural heat transfer. The modified Stefan number introduced in this study leads to a rise in the dominancy of convection. The Nusselt number in the PCM phase change procedure has an inverse relation with the Stefan number. The Nusselt number increased with the concentration of PCM. It was found that although PCM viscosity may increase with increasing PCM concentration, it has a favorable effect on the thermal performance. The sidewalls effect on natural heat transfer and an increase in temperature on viscosity reduction were evident. Concerning the Nusselt number, it was found that the PCM in the liquid phase and phase change process was more deviated than the solid phase PCM.\nConsidering the increasing use of PCMs as TES sources, researchers are looking for methods to increase the amount of heat storage in these materials. With the development of human knowledge and the introduction of high-conductive nanomaterials, many researches were done on the phase change of thesematerials, which may be discussed in a few instances.\nUsing LBM, the melting process of ice inside the bottom-heated enclosure in presence of copper nanoparticles was studied by Feng et al. [311] (Fig. 48b). The results of this study were presented for flow and temperature fields for the three cases of base fluid and nanofluid combinations with volume fractions of 0.5 and 1% and Grashof numbers of 5 104 104 and 2.5 105. The composition of nanoparticles and PCM has higher heat transfer efficiency than pure material. As the concentration of nanoparticles increases, the melting line progresses faster. In addition, the energy stored also increases. On the other hand, it was seen that for high concentrations of nanoparticles for the Grashof number 2.5 105, an asymmetric melting front is created.\nMelting of the hybrid of paraffin-alumina nanoparticles in a square enclosure shown in Fig. 48 under cross-sectional heating and cooling was examined by Arici et al. [312]. This study was performed for different volume fractions of 1, 2 and 3%. The highest melting rate was found that happens for the volume fraction of 1% and bottom-heated enclosure. Addition of alumina nanoparticles to paraffin resulted in an increase by 6.7% and 10.6% in the thermal storage and melting rate, respectively, for the concentration of 1%. According to the investigations on nanofluids and the effect of adding nanoparticles to the base fluid, it was observed that the thermal conductivity and viscosity increase and the heat capacity decreases by increasing the volume percentage of nanoparticles [313e316]. Therefore, the results of Arici et al. [312] demonstrated that the buoyancy force cannot overcome the force due to the viscosity by increasing the volume percentage of nanoparticles and enhancing the viscosity. On the other hand, the heat capacity of PCMs is decreased. Hence, the melting rate and thermal energy storage decrease with the volume fraction of nanoparticles.\nSimilar work on paraffin-copper nanoparticles was conducted by Sebti et al. [317] through the use of enthalpy method. This study showed that the volume fraction of nanoparticles in the base fluid is effective on themelting rate by affecting the rate of conductive heat transfer. This effect results in a raise in the melting rate as the concentration rises. Phase change of water-Cu nanomaterial in an insulated enclosure was examined by Darzy et al. [318] to reveal the\nimportance of convection effects using LBM (Fig. 48C). In this study, the effect of the heater location inside the enclosure was also investigated. An increase in the concentration from zero to 4% results in a rise in the melting rate by 52.7%, 41.2%, and 30%, respectively, for the location of heat source in top, center, and bottom of the enclosure. Solidification of the same mixture was further analyzed by Kashani et al. [319] with corrugated vertical walls. The effect of wall wave, concentration of nanomaterials, and Grashof number, in wide ranges, on freezing time and natural convection were investigated. In this study, the supercooling phenomenon and the effect of nanoparticle diffusion at the freezing point were ignored. However, it is found that the supercooling occurs in reality because pure water cools to 5 C to 7 C and then begins to freeze. The porosity-enthalpy method was used for numerical study of solidification phenomenon. This method has been used for years as one of the methods of modeling the melting and freezing processes. The energy equation has been derived in terms of enthalpy. The results of this study showed that by increasing the concentration and the Gr value, the Nu value increase. Overall, this study showed that the shape of the enclosure, along with other influencing factors such as nanoparticle volume fraction and free convection rate has a positive impact on the phase change procedure.\nMelting of paraffin-aluminum oxide nanofluid was examined by Arasu et al. [323] for the 25 mm 25 mm enclosure. The enclosure was heated from its sidewalls. In this study, the effect of orientation of heat source and volume fraction of aluminum oxide particles on the melting process was investigated. Fig. 49 shows an overview of the enclosure. Navier-Stokes equations and the enthalpy method were solved as the governing equations. The equations were analyzed in FLUENT software. The results showed that the melting\nrate rises by 0.02 in the base fluid by increasing the concentration. It was demonstrated that as the concentration increases, the melting rate begins to decrease until the melting rate less than that for pure paraffin for the volume fraction of 5%. The amount of heat absorbed by the nanofluid is declined with the percentage of alumina nanoparticles. Thus, lower volume fractions of alumina nanoparticles in paraffin not only create a better melting process but also increase energy storage capacity for constant dimensions of the enclosure.\nFan and Khodadadi [324] experimentally investigated nonlinear fast freezing in cyclohexane fluid. This compound was prepared using copper oxide nanoparticles of different mass concentrations. The problem was considered one-dimensional for a wall of limited thickness and high depth. Initially, the liquid PCMwas assumed at a temperature above freezing temperature. The sidewall temperature drops suddenly to a temperature lower than the melting point. By neglecting the effects of supercooling, freezing begins rapidly in the adjacent left wall and moves to the right wall. The Fourier equation was used to mathematically describe the conduction and convection in the solid and liquid phases. Khodadadi and Fan [325] described this method in another study to show that the highest freezing rate occurs at volumetric concentration of 0.02, while the freezing rate decreases as the concentration rises by 0.04 probably due to a cross-sectional increase in thermal conductivity of the solid phase. Melting process of nanoparticle-reinforced PCM in the two-dimensional enclosure shown in Fig. 49 was numerically studied by Sebti et al. [326] using FVM over a non-uniform grid. In this study, paraffin-copper nanofluid with different volume fractions was used. The enthalpy-porosity method was used to track the melting line. In this study, the effect of nanoparticle diffusion in the base fluid and some of the governing parameters such as hot\nwall temperature and enclosure volume on the flow field, heat transfer rate and melting line motion were investigated. The incompressible steady nanofluid flow was presumed Newtonian with uniform properties, and all thermodynamic properties except the density modeled with Boussinesq approximation were assumed to be constant. The left wall temperature was higher than the melting temperature with a difference of 10 C. They reported the following results: i) at the beginning of the melting, the conduction mechanism plays a key role in thermal performance and the melt line moves parallel to the heated surface, ii) solid fraction decreases linearly with the time, but the freezing rate is initially fast and becomes slow at the end, iii) distribution of nanoparticles within the PCM hasten themelting time due to a rise in the thermal conductivity and Nu, iv) the effect of dispersing nanopowder to the base fluid on heat transfer is greater for larger enclosures, v) the higher the temperature difference, the faster the melting procedure, vi) fluid flow and melting line shape depend on the melt layer thickness and the concentration during phase-change, and vii) the amount of energy stored can be increased by proper nanoparticle dispersion within the PCM.\nHosseinizadeh et al. [327] investigated the melting of a nanoparticle-reinforced material in a cylindrical enclosure experimentally. The base fluid of paraffin and copper nanoparticles were used (Fig. 49). The fluid was precooled with the initial temperature of 23 C. The results of this study showed that adding nanoparticles to the base PCM either increases the thermal conductivity and\ndeclines the latent heat of melting lead to hastening the melting. Khodadadi and Hosseinizadeh [328] simulated the freezing procedure of water using CuO nanoparticles in a rectangular enclosure. Horizontal surfaces were assumed to be insulated and sidewalls were at 283.15 K and 273.15 K. At the freezing point, the temperature on both sides was reduced to 10 K. In this way, the freezing process begins. The simulation was performed using FLUENT software. The results were analyzed for different Grashof and Stefan numbers. In general, using nanoparticles can significantly increase thermal performance.\nThe annulus filled with nanoparticle-reinforced PCMs was numerically and experimentally studied by Dhaidan et al. [322]. The inner cylinder was kept at a constant heat flux, while the outer surface of the outer cylinder was well insulated. N-octadecane was selected as the PCMwith copper oxide nanoparticles as the thermal conductivity enhancer. The process of melting and changing temperature was observed at many points during the experiment. In this study, the FEM was used for numerical simulations of the process and the effect of volume percentages of nanoparticles and Rayleigh number on melting process was investigated. The results of this study showed that in acute response of melting, the dominant phenomenon of heat transfer is the conduction mechanism, which is characterized by concentric isothermal lines. Subsequently, free convection and the melting rate rises in the upper half of the enclosure. In other words, melting in the lower half is controlled by thermal diffusion and becomes more powerful as the\nRa rises. Altohamy et al. [329] investigated heat transfer in a spherical capsule containing water and alumina nanoparticles experimentally. The results were extracted and compared for distilled water and nanofluid concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 1.5%. A Freon 404 refrigerant with temperatures of 6, 8, 10 and 12 C and different flow rateswas used to cool and freeze the PCM. The results showed that as the volume fraction of nanoparticles increases, the percentage of energy storage increases.\nMelting of n-octadecane copper oxide nanomaterial in the horizontal cylinder shown in Fig. 49C under a fixed heat flux on the outer wall was examined experimentally and numerically by Daidan et al. [330]. The experimental apparatus was equipped with several temperature sensors located at different angles of the cylinder. So that it was possible to track the melting line in different test modes. The numerical approach was performed using the FEM. The effect of different volume fractions and Rayleigh numbers on\nvariables such as heat transfer and melting rates as well as charge time was investigated. They approved that increasing the heat flux and concentration raises the melting rate and declines the charge time. Either the conduction and convection mechanics play important roles in promoting phase change. At the early stages of melting, which most of the cavity is still solid, the conduction phenomenon is dominant. The liquid fraction inside the enclosure increases over time and convection becomes dominant. The interesting point in this study is that the positive effects of nanoparticles occur at low weight fractions. However, at higher weight fractions, the effect of solid nanoparticles was negligible compared to the influence of the viscosity and consequently natural convection heat transfer.\nUsing the porosity-enthalpy method, Kashani et al. [331] simulated the solidification process of n-hexadecane with copper nanoparticles. The results of this study revealed that the thermal properties inside the base material increase with the addition of\nnanoparticles. The researchers believed that using appropriate nanoparticles can improve the properties of the PCM as a storage material.\nZarma et al. [332] investigated photovoltaic focusing on CPVnanoparticles-PCM numerically (Fig. 50). The effect of different nanoparticles of Al2O3, CuO, SiO2 with a mass fraction of 1%e5% on the photovoltaic concentration was investigated. In this research, 2D simulations of models including photovoltaic nanoparticle layers in PCM were validated with experimental data. It was observed that by an increase in the PCM temperature and the melting rate, a reduction in the solar cell temperature and the use of nanoparticles in the PCM lead to that the temperature becomes more uniform and electrical efficiency in the CPV system increases. It was also found that using Al2O3 nanoparticles with a mass fraction of 5% in PCM leads to an electrical efficiency of 8% and a uniform temperature of 12 C, whereas pure PCM results in maximum electrical efficiency of 6.36% and uniform temperature of 20 C. In this study, n-octadecane, paraffin, and graphene were used as PCM.\nMelting of three types of CuO nano-PCM including, paraffinwax, coconut oil, and Rubitherm, in a cubic enclosure were compared by Al-Jethelah et al. [333] (Fig. 51). Their melting point respectively were 54 C, 24 C, and 18 Cwith the ambient temperature of 24 C. The left surface was kept at constant temperature and the horizontal and right surfaces were isolated. The continuum and momentum equations were solved for liquid and the energy equation was solved in solid and liquid regions using FEM. The spatiotemporal variation of the melting front was captured as well as the temperature and flow pattern for various nano-PCM\nconcentrations, Ra and Ste numbers. The rapid propagation of melting front and heat transfer rate were reported as the concentration increased. A scale analysis was first introduced to describe different melting regimes. The results presented were consistent with previous results.\nRen et al. [334] proposed adding nanoparticles and metal foam to the PCM for the purpose of thermal performance improvement. Their study was based on enthalpy and buoyant boundary in the LBM. The average PCM liquid fraction, energy stored per unit width Q, and mean temperature at LHTES were systematically studied in various porosities and sizes of metal foam, nanoparticle volume fraction, and heat pipe radius. The results were as follows: i) the melting rate of PCM with nanoparticles in LHTES can be increased by decreasing the porous metal foam or by increasing the nanoparticle volume fraction. In this paper, an optimum amount of porous metal foam mixture and nanoparticles were obtained to achieve maximum energy storage capacity f¼ 0.01 and εave ¼ 0.95, ii) it was observed that by declining the metal foam porosity at a constant volume, the melting rate of PCM increases. Both the conduction and convection heat transfer was found that have effects in the same order on the thermal performance. For high porous metal foams, the average temperature increases with the porosity size during conduction heat transfer. Reduction of porosity of metal foam can decrease the heat transfer of the LHTES due to the use of metal foam with small porosity size, iii) the heat pipe radius of the LHTES unit has a significant impact. As the diameter increases, the melting rate increases, and iv) the effect of porous metal foam on energy storage in LHTES is greater than that of\nxamined by Zarma et al. [332].\nnanoparticles. Ebadi et al. [335] studied melting, heat transfer, and TES properties of a CuO nano-PCM in a Cylindrical TES System (C-TES) in various concentrations and Ra values, then they validated the numerical results with experimental ones. The mathematical model based on nonlinear differential equations was used to study mass, momentum, and transport properties within C-TES. The bottom was insulated and it was heated from sides and up surfaces. The numerical results obtained from the solid-melt interface and the liquid fraction for PCM and nano-PCM were compared with the experiments and good agreements were shown. The flow pattern was shown that is not sensitive to the concentration. The results showed that the stored energy did not significantly vary with Ra values in early stages, while its sensitivity becomes more and more over time. Hence, a large difference is observed when the melting increases at high Rayleigh numbers.\nFinally, according to recent studies and articles, using latent heat storage units that use PCMs is an effective method to save energy that has received much attention in recent years. PCMs are used to store thermal energy and their importance has environmental and economic aspects. Due to the fact that materials release energy phase change during phase change, their use reduces energy consumption [41,122,336,337].\nAccording to studies, the use of nanoparticles in phase change materials improves the thermal conductivity of phase change materials. In fact, the use of nanoparticles in phase change materials improves the performance of energy storage systems. On the other hand, the use of phase change materials reduces energy consumption and causes temperature uniformity in different temperature fluctuations [41,121,338e341].\nRecent studies also demonstrate that when the melting and freezing behavior of PCMs and nano-PCMs are evaluated, their thermophysical properties, especially the viscosity, must also be carefully measured. Previous studies show that the wrong value of viscosity leads to the incorrect output of numerical simulation results from experimental data significantly [342e345]."

      "text" : "In this study, a detailed review of recent researches and developments in PCM technology and their natural convection were presented, focusing on the models used for the numerical\nsimulations. According to the results of previous studies about the use of PCM for heat energy storage, it can be stated that in all cases the reduction of energy consumption, in some cases up to 20% is one of their advantages (especially during peak power hours). The benefits of using these materials in buildings can be attributed to the increased thermal comfort of residents due to the reduction of temperature fluctuations. Also, the reduction of temperature fluctuations in sensitive cases such as greenhouse, solar heaters, and dryers can affect the desired quality of the finished product. Despite the advantages of using PCMs and their potential for high temperature latent heat storage, there are some technical challenges that need to be addressed in future works, such as supercooling, which is a major problem for PCMs that affects the storage performance and material stability. Therefore, further studies are suggested. The presence of salts and hydrated salts in PCMs causes corrosion and damage to warehouses and building materials, requiring further investigation to determine the compatibility between PCMs and various building materials, which will affect the life and stability of heat storage units. Since PCMmicro-capsulation is a potential solution to the corrosion problem, a standard test method must be established for leakage tests, as most enclosed PCMs are not currently tested. In addition, the micro-encapsulation can be used to increase heat transfer and prevent phase separation during the melting process, so the stability test is crucial for the final evaluation of the effects of the encapsulation process. Although the melting points of most PCMs and nano-PCMs are known, thermal conductivities, densities, specific heat capacities, and volume expansions of liquids and solids are not fully consistent across studies. Therefore, these features are sometimes unavailable for PCMs and nano-PCMs. Thus, to provide reliable results and data, a standard test method and a database should be provided. Increasing heat transfer is another subject that needs further studies, especially with the focus on their thermal conductivities. As one can see from previous researches, one of the potential advances is dispersing highly conductive nanoparticles in PCMs. However, there are a few studies to strengthen PCMs using nanoparticles.\nPrice of PCMs has been high due to demand and supply. Currently, due to limited demand, they are mainly produced with relatively high prices. However, there is a huge market potential for PCMs in a variety of applications, including building energy management. Since producers set their prices based on future market\nexpectations, prices decrease in the future. Current studies are expected to evaluate the energy performance of PCMs, thus playing an important role in shaping their vision for building applications. As a result, doing these researches and increasing their use can increase their demand and reduce their prices.\nMost researches on change phase problems were performed at temperatures ranging from 0 to 60 C that are proper for heating/ cooling of homes with casual PCMs including, stearic acid, wax, paraffin, Glauber’s salts, and n-octadecane. There are a few studies on thermal heat systems with moderate temperatures for hot side storage that can be used for air conditioners.\nNumerical methods are restricted to solve phase change problems in 2D because of the cumbersome equations. For the first time, it was assumed that the phase change problem is controlled by latent heat. However, in recent years, free convection in liquids phase has been taken into account, adding complexities to these problems. Its advantage not to study the melting front makes the enthalpy formulation as one of the common methods to solve phase change problems. Variations in the obtained models to determine the melting and strength effects of PCMs, which is characterized by different methods of analyzing and selecting, is observable. Therefore, the selection of correlations for design purposes and quantitative comparison is required. Neither international nor national standards for PCM tests were documented to date. Thus, researchers have used different methods for testing and analysis for many years. Different values of PCMs thermophysical properties were used showing a major problem of testing standards.\nAuthor statement\nSara Rostami: Writing, Review & Editing.

    "abstractText" : "Phase change materials (PCMs) are capable of storing energy as latent energy by changing the phase and provide the stored energy when they are returned to their initial phase at a desired time. Due to the varying melting temperature of these materials, their application in air conditions of buildings, as well as the provision of hygienic hot water has received much attention, recently. This paper first provides a detailed illustration of phase change materials and their working principle, different types, and properties. Then a characteristic example of PCMs in solar energy storage and the design of PCMs are reviewed and analyzed. Next, this paper focuses on the heat transfer, melting and freezing processes of PCM/nano-PCMS including different models and experimental research on the natural convection and thermal energy storage. Finally, some challenges and suggestions are presented following the conclusion of this article. It is found that these materials generally improve system efficiency. Without using mechanical equipment, these materials are naturally adapted to the temperature fluctuations of the environment, leading to a reduction in energy consumption and subsequently energy management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
