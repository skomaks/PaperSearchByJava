The side walls of the cavity are cold and the upper and lower ones are insulated. A wall with a thermal-conductivity of 100 and a thickness of 0.5 is located on the cold walls. Moreover, there is a constant temperature heat source in the center of the enclosure. The enclosure is located under the influence of an inclined magnetic field (MF). The governing equations were solved using the finite volume method (FVM) and solved using the SIMPLE algorithm. The results show that the heat transfer rate intensifies up to 3.11 times with intensifying the Rayleigh number (Ra). The maximum heat transfer occurred at weak magnetic fields. By augmenting the angle of the enclosure, the heat transfer rate on the right and left walls intensifies by 33% and declines by 55%, respectively. The heat transfer rate on the right wall intensifies by 14% by augmenting the angle of the MF. The addition of nano-additives also results in intensification in the heat transfer rate.\nKeywords: Finite volume Method; Natural-convective heat transfer; Nano-fluid; Conductive walls; Inclined enclosure;\nNomenclature Conductive wall width b )1-ms( Velocity components in x and y directions u ,v Magnetic field strength 0B Brownian motion velocity Brv ( / , / )f fU ul V vlα α= = Velocity component U,V Specific heat j/(kg.k) pC Cartesian coordinates (m) x,y Nanoadditive diameter (nm) d Coordinates (X=x/l, Y=y/l) X,Y )2Gravitational acceleration (m/s g Greek symbols .k)2w/(m Convection heat transfer coefficient h ) 1-s2Thermal diffusivity (m α Nanoadditive diameter (nm) d Solid volume fraction ϕ Hartmann number Ha Magnetic field angle (ᵒ) ω Enclosure non-dimension length (l/l) H Dynamic viscosity w/(m.K) μ Thermal-conductivity w/(m.k) k Kinematic viscosity (m2s-1) υ )f/ksHeat fin conductivity ratio (k K* Density (kgm-3) ρ Boltzmann constant [m2kg/ s−2K−1] bk Electrical conductivity ( .mΩ ) σ Enclosure length (m) l angel of cavity (ᵒ) γ Heat source length (m) ll Stream function (m2s−1) \uD835\uDF13\uD835\uDF13 Heat source non-dimension length (ll/l) L Dimensionless stream function Ψ ) fhl/kNusselt number ( Nu Local Nusselt number sNu Subscripts Average Nusselt number aveNu Jo ur na l P\nre -p\nro of\nPure fluid f Pressure (Pa) p Maximum max 2 2( / )nf fP l ρ α −Pressure P Average ave Prandtl number ( / )f fϑ α Pr Nano-fluid nf Rayleigh number 3( ( / ))f h c f fg l T Tβ α ϑ− Ra Temperature (K) T"

      "text" : "Enclosed enclosures are widely used in various industries such as aerospace, food industry, petrochemicals, solar collectors, electronic components cooling and many other engineering industries. Hence, many researchers have studied the heat transfer in closed enclosures [1-6]. Since the purpose of these enclosures is to intensify the heat transfer rate, high-conductivity fluids should be used. According to the previous studies, nano-fluids have a higher thermal-conductivity than simple fluids [7-23]. Hence, the researchers have decided to use nano-fluids in the cavities instead of using simple fluids such as water and air. They investigated the heat transfer rate by adding nanoadditives in different types of enclosures. There are many papers studied heat transfer of nano-fluids in enclosures. For example, the investigation of Selimefendigil and Oztop [24], Revnic et al. [25], Rahimi et al. [26], Izadi et al. [27], Safaei et al. [28], Cho et al. [29], and Ma et al. [30] can be reported. In all of these papers, the same results are achieved. Their results indicate that augmenting the Ra and the volume fraction of nanoadditives result in an intensification of the heat transfer rate in the enclosures.\nThe researchers studied the heat transfer rate in the enclosures by considering a MF due to the application of the MF in some industries such as defense industries, heat exchangers etc. [31-39]. They used a parameter called Hartmann number to investigate the effect of MF strength. Higher Ha means stronger MF. Pordanjani et al. [40] considered natural-convection heat transfer in an enclosure under a MF numerically. They understood that the heat transfer rate intensifies with boosting of Ra and decreasing of Ha. Benos and Sarris [41] analyzed the performance of a nano-fluid in a cavity with a heat source under MF.\nThere are many ways to enhance the heat transfer rate include the application of expanded surfaces in the enclosures. The surface of heat exchanger is enlarged by using the baffles leads to an intensification of the performance of heat exchanger. Aminossadati and Ghasemi [42] employed SIMPLE algorithm to examine the performance of a square cavity filled with several nano-fluids. The cavity was equipped with a heat source on its bottom wall. The\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nnano-fluid is assumed to be Newtonian. They assessed the effects of Ra, the location and geometry of the heat source, the nano-fluid type and the volume fraction of nanoadditives. Khorasanizadeh et al. [43] investigated heat transfer of Cu/water nano-fluid in a square cavity using the SIMPLER algorithm numerically. They understood that convective heat transfer is very low at Ra=104, but the average Nusselt number intensifies at high Ra. Pordanjani et al. [44] analyzed the cooling performance of a nano-fluid in a square enclosure with two blades. They investigated the effect of the volume fraction of nanoadditives, Ra, and Ha on the flow field, temperature, and heat transfer rate. They reported that the heat transfer rate intensifies by augmenting the Ra and volume fraction of nanoadditives and reducing the Ha.\nBy considering the ever-augmenting use of energy and the reduction of fossil fuel resources, researchers have interested in evaluating the performance of different types of devices. One of the ways of exploring the efficiency of different types of energy sources is to investigate their entropy generation. This parameter is based on the second law of thermodynamics and can be a suitable measure for the measurement of the amount of losses. According to the above mentioned, the researchers have studied the heat transfer rate and the entropy generation in the enclosures simultaneously [45-54]. Alnaqi et al. [55] studied heat transfer and entropy generation of alumina/water nano-fluid in a square cavity equipped with a blade on a hot-wall numerically. They found that the variations in the heat transfer rate and entropy generation are similar. The heat transfer rate and entropy generation intensify by augmenting the Ra and reducing the Ha. Ghasemi and Siavashi [56] performed the first-law and second-law evaluations of an enclosure with a porous blade. The cavity was saturated with a nano-fluid and it was located under the MF. They examined the impact of blade dimensions on the heat transfer rate.\nThere are various ways to intensify the heat transfer rate that addition of nanoadditives and application of blades are the most practical ones. The blades can intensification the heat transfer rate by enhancing the heat exchange surface and the nano-fluid can also intensify the heat transfer by augmenting the thermal-conductivity of the working fluid. Since the enclosures are under the MF in many industries, it is important to consider the MF. The present work aims to investigate the heat transfer of alumina/water nano-fluid in a square enclosure under an inclined MF. A heat source at temperature Th is placed in the middle of the cavity to heat the nano-fluid. The main objective of the present work is to use a conductive wall in the enclosure. In this way, there is a conductive wall on the cold walls of the enclosure. In the present work, the influences of Ra, Hartman number, MF angle, Jo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nenclosure angle, volume fraction of nanoadditives, and aspect ratio on the heat transfer rate are investigated."

      "text" : "In Fig. 3, streamlines and isothermal lines are plotted for Ha= 30, AR=0.35, 0θ = , γ= 45, φ= 0.03 and different Ra. The streamlines show that two separate vortices are formed for all Ra. These two vortices have the opposite direction. The cause for the formation of these vortices is the buoyancy force. The density of the fluid in the locality of the heat source declines due to the heating. By decreasing the density and lightening the fluid, the fluid mass moves upward in opposite direction of the gravity. The fluid flow reach the cold wall and its temperature declines leads to an intensifies in the density. Therefore, the fluid moves down. The continuity of this fluid movement causes to form a vortex in the cavity. Conversely, two vortices are formed around the heat source because of the presence of a barrier in the center of the cavity and the angle of the cavity with respect the horizontal axis. The right vortex is stronger due to its better condition for vortex generation. The streamlines show that the maximum stream function intensifies with augmenting the Ra. The density of the streamlines in the enclosure intensifies by augmenting the Ra. The intensification in the density of the streamlines means that the velocity gradient intensifies and, as a result, the fluid flow inside the compartment becomes faster. The reason is that an intensification of the Ra results in an intensification of the buoyancy force and intensification in the fluid flow. Hence, the strength of the vortex intensifies. Isotherms show that two phenomena occur by augmenting the Ra. First, the density of the isothermal lines intensifies in the lower part of the heat source and the upper right side wall. This shows an increase in temperature gradient inside these areas. Therefore, the rate of heat transfer also intensifies. This is also because of an intensification of the velocity of fluid mass displacement by augmenting the Ra, which ultimately leads to an intensification of the gradient of temperature. Second, the isothermal lines are more irregular and their curvature intensifies for high Ra compared to low ones. For the case of low curvature of the isotherms, the chief mechanism of heat transfer is conduction and for the case of high curvature, this mechanism is natural-convection. Thus, the conduction heat transfer mechanism declines and natural-convection heat transfer mechanism intensifies with augmenting the Ra. This is due to more fluid movement with augmenting the Ra. Higher heat transfer rate in the natural-convection than the conduction one results in an intensification of the heat transfer rate in the enclosure.\n6Ra=10 Ra= 31622 3Ra=10\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nIn Fig. 4, the flow and thermal fields are presented for Ra=31622, AR=0.35, 0θ = , γ= 45, φ= 0.03 and dissimilar Ha. The Hartman numeral represents the MF strength. By augmenting the strength of the MF, the Lorentz force in the cavity intensifies. This force causes the velocity of fluid to reduce in the compartment. As the Lorentz force acting against the buoyancy force and prevents the vortex motion. Hence, the velocity of the vortices declines by reducing the fluid velocity. This decrease in the fluid velocity can change the heat transfer mechanism from convection to conduction at high Ra. But at low Ra, which the fluid velocity is low, it produces small variations. Isotherms also show that a slight change occurs in the density of the streamlines by augmenting the Ha. As the Hartman number intensifies, the density of isotherms declines steadily close to the heat source. This results in a reduction in the temperature gradient which can ultimately leads to a reduction in the heat transfer rate in the enclosure.\nHa=60 Ha=30 Ha=0\n4 -18 0.7\n99 52\n3\n-1\n0.0 3\n-0. 03\n0.9 0.8\n0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4\n0.3\n0.2 0.1\n0.9 0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4\n0.1\n0.90 .80\n.7 0.6 0.\n5 0.40.30.20.1\nJo ur\nal Pr\ne-\npr\noo f\nIn Fig. 5, Nuave calculated on the cold wall is plotted for, AR=0.35, 0θ = , γ= 45, φ= 0.03 and dissimilar Ha and Ra. The Nusselt number behavior is quite different by augmenting the Hartman number for different Ra. At low Ra, Nuave intensifies and then declines by augmenting the Ha. But at high Ra, Nuave intensifies and then declines by augmenting the Ha. Different behavior of the Nu is due to the angle of the enclosure and the presence of a heat source in it. At low Ra, while the chief mechanism of heat transfer is conduction, the Lorentz force drives the fluid away from the walls with the intensification of the Ha. However, more intensification in the Ha leads to higher temperature gradient and an intensification of the Nusselt number. In general, at low Ra, the variation of the Nusselt number is not considerable with the Ha, and the variations are very small. At high Ra, the fluid in the lower part of the enclosure goes into the vortex and more fluid is rotating as the Hartman number intensifies. This leads to an intensification of the Nusselt number, but as the MF becomes stronger and Lorentz force intensifies, the velocity of the vortex declines. In this case, the Lorentz force prevents the vortex motion results in a reduction in the heat transfer. For all Ha, the heat transfer rate intensifies by augmenting the Ra, which is more considerable for weak MFs. As the Ra intensifies, the buoyancy force and vortex velocity intensification leads to an intensification of the heat transfer rate.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre\nFig. 5.

Streamlines show that two vortices are formed for all angles of the enclosure. These two vortices are symmetry for the angles of 0° and 90° and are asymmetry for the inclined enclosure. In the enclosure with a zero angle, two vortices of the same size and the opposite direction are formed that are moving in all space of the enclosure. The fluid moves upwards as its temperature intensifies in the vicinity of the heat source and then goes up and after interaction with the upper wall moves towards the side walls of the enclosure.

The fluid is cooled and then, after colliding with the bottom wall, goes up. As a result, two symmetric vortices are formed on both sides of the heat source. As the inclination angle intensifies, the velocity of the fluid declines dramatically at the bottom of the enclosure. Because the fluid is moving faster between the heat source and cold top wall and the fluid in the lower part does not move due to its high density. Hence, the upper vortex is stronger than the lower one. For the inclination angle of 90°, there is no fluid flow in the bottom of the chamber because of the heat exchange between the heat source and the top cold. So, the fluid does not move from the bottom wall to the top one. Isothermal lines also show that for inclination angles of 0° and 90°, these lines are symmetry relative to the heat source and the highest density is observed below the heat source. At this point, because the cold fluid collides with the heat source for the first time, a large temperature gradient is formed and the density of the isothermal lines is high. As the inclination angle intensifies, the density of isotherms intensifies at the right side of the enclosure. The reason is that the vortex is stronger in this area results in an intensification of the temperature gradient. For the angle of 90°, the density of isothermal lines is low in the bottom of the enclosure, which indicates that the heat transfer rate is very low in this area.\nγ=90 γ=45 γ=0\nψ\n4 - 5\n-6 2\n-44\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nr of\nIn Fig. 7, dimensionless velocity and dimensionless temperature are plotted at the line X =\n0.5 for Ra = 31622, Ha = 30, AR = 0.2, 0θ =  , φ = 0.03, and dissimilar inclination angles. As the inclination angle of the enclosure intensifies, the velocity declines sharply. In addition, the symmetry of the curves relative to the heat source is reduced, which is due to that an enclosure with inclination angle of 0 has better conditions for the formation of vortex. These conditions are weakened with augmenting the angle, so that very weak vortex is formed at the angle of 90 in the lower part of the enclosure because the cool fluid remains on the bottom of the cold wall. Isothermal line also exhibit symmetrical trend relative to the heat source. The symmetry is vanishes with augmenting the angle of the enclosure. The conditions for vortex formation on the top of the heat source are improved and the convection in the lower part is significantly weakened with the intensification in the angle of the enclosure. It can be seen that the temperature declines in the region below the heat source at the angle of 90 and intensifies above the heat source.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\noo"

It can be seen that the vortex shaped in the upper area of the cavity is strengthened by augmenting the angle of the MF. But the bottom vortex does not change. The Lorentz force due to the MF causes more fluid to move upward by augmenting the angle of the MF. As a result, the cold fluid that remains in the lower part of the cavity moves and the vortex also penetrates in these areas. Hence, the strength of the resulting vortex is intensified. The variation of isotherms is not considerable by changing the angle of the MF. By dragging the fluid flow to the top of the enclosure, the isothermal lines are pulled to that area. This also makes the isotherms to have more distant from the bottom of the enclosure results in small temperature gradient in this area.\n90θ =  45θ =  0θ = \nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro\nψ\nT\nFig. 8.

The maximum and minimum velocity reduces by augmenting the angle of the MF. This indicates a decrease in the velocity of the fluid in the cavity. By augmenting the angle of the MF, the Lorentz force causes the fluid to move towards the top region of the enclosure. Hence, the velocity of the vortex inside the enclosure declines and the maximum velocity is reduced. It can be seen from the temperature diagram that as the MF angle intensifies, the temperature in the enclosure is reduced slightly because of a decrease in vortex velocity for the reasons explained. In general, variation of the angle of the MF does not affect the temperature and velocity considerably.\n(b)(a)\n-7\n2 -6 2 2 -5\n0.9 0.8\n0. 7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4 0.3 0.2\n0.1\n0.90 .80. 7 0.\n6 0.5\n0.4 0.3\n0.2 0.1\n0.9 0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5 0.4 0.3\n0.2 0.1\nJo ur\nn l P\nre\n-p\nro of\nFig. 9.

It can be observed that the variation of the Nu has not a constant trend with the variations of the inclination angle of the enclosure and the angle of the MF. For the case of zero inclination angle, the Nusselt number intensifies by augmenting the angle of the MF. The maximum Nusselt number occurs for zero inclination angle and horizontal MF. In this case, the Lorentz force due to the MF results in an intensification of the fluid motion in the enclosure and amplifies the vortex, which ultimately results in an intensification of the heat transfer rate. However, it is seen that the Nusselt number variations with the changes in the angles of the enclosure and the MF angle are low as the maximum change is less than 25%.\nY\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n ( X\n=L /2\n)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nTeta Teta Teta\nY\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nU (X\n=L /2\n)\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nTeta Teta Teta\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro\nof\nFig. 10.

Streamlines show that the vortex strength declines by augmenting the aspect ratio. This is due to the narrowing of the space to rotate the vortex. As the heat source size intensifies, the space inside the enclosure becomes narrower and the fluid velocity in the enclosure declines. Isotherms show that the curvature of the isothermal lines declines and they become more regular by augmenting the aspect ratio. The density of isotherms intensifies with the aspect ratio leads to an intensification of the temperature gradient results in an intensification of the heat transfer rate.

The fig. 12a shows that the velocity declines rapidly as the size of the heat source intensifies. This is due to that the space for fluid motion declines leads to a decrease in the vortex velocity. In all cases, the direction of streamlines is upward in the vicinity of the heat source and is downward close to the cold wall. This shows the direction of two vortices around the heat source. It can be seen from the isothermal lines that the temperature gradient declines sharply by augmenting the size of the heat source. This is due to the reduction of the fluid velocity, which causes the fluid to move slowly results in a reduction in the temperature gradient.

Fig. 13a reveals that the heat transfer rate intensifies with the intensification of the aspect ratio and the Ra. This is more obvious for low aspect ratios. At low aspect ratios, the main mechanism of heat transfer is convection that intensifies with augmenting the Ra. At high aspect ratios, the main mechanism of heat transfer is conduction and the buoyancy force does not affect the heat transfer rate. An intensification of the buoyancy force affects the convection mechanism that is weak in this case. Hence, the heat transfer rate intensifies with the intensification of the aspect ratio and the Ra. Fig. 13b demonstrates that the variations of the Ha leads to a constant trend for the Nusselt number for different aspect ratios. As a result, maximum heat transfer rate occurs for a weak MF and a large aspect ratio, as is the case in the previous sections. It has been explained before.\n(b) (a)\nJo ur\nna l P\nre\n-p\nro"

An intensification of the volume fraction of nano-additives leads to an intensification of the thermal-conductivity of the base-fluid. A greater heat transfer happens in the fluid by augmenting the thermalconductivity of the nano-fluid, which causes the fluid to receive higher heat transfer in the locality of the walls. So, the heat transfer rate intensifies close to the side cold wall by augmenting the volume fraction of nanoadditives. It can be seen that maximum heat transfer rate takes place in the upper part of the wall. This is also due to collision of heated fluid for the first time in this section. The heated fluid moves upwards and after colliding with the upper wall goes to the side wall and then collide with the cold wall. Hence, the heat transfer rate in this region is greater than that in other areas because of higher temperature gradient.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\nro\nFig. 14.

The side walls of the cavity are cold and the upper and lower ones are insulated. A wall with a thermal-conductivity of 100 and a thickness of 0.5 is located on the cold walls. Moreover, there is a constant temperature heat source in the center of the enclosure. The enclosure is located under the influence of an inclined magnetic field (MF). The governing equations were solved using the finite volume method (FVM) and solved using the SIMPLE algorithm. The results show that the heat transfer rate intensifies up to 3.11 times with intensifying the Rayleigh number (Ra). The maximum heat transfer occurred at weak magnetic fields. By augmenting the angle of the enclosure, the heat transfer rate on the right and left walls intensifies by 33% and declines by 55%, respectively. The heat transfer rate on the right wall intensifies by 14% by augmenting the angle of the MF. The addition of nano-additives also results in intensification in the heat transfer rate.",
