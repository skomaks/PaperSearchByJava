      "text" : "Among the structural ceramic materials, silicon nitride (Si3N4) based ceramics are widely studied because of their applications at room as well as elevated temperature environments. The tailored microstructure in accordance with the properties required can be achieved easily by liquid phase sintering, and this is the main advantage of silicon nitride ceramics [1]. Silicon nitride has excellent chemical, mechanical, thermal and tribological properties. Owing to these properties, silicon nitride based ceramics are widely used in heat exchangers, gas turbine engines, turbocharger rotors, automotive engine components and microwave devices [2–6]. However, microstructural development and densification are very difficult in Si3N4 because of the strong covalent bonding between Si and N, and the low self-diffusivity of Si (DSi ≈ 0.5× 10–19 m2s−1 at 1400 °C) and N (DN ≈ 6.8×10−10 m2 s−1 at 1400 °C) in bulk and at the grain boundaries of Si3N4 [7,8]. Sintering additives are added for the fabrication of silicon nitride based ceramics, which forms the low-temperature eutectic liquid phase through the chemical reaction between the sintering additives and the nascent SiO2 present on the surface of silicon nitride particles [9,10].\nThe addition of both oxide (Al2O3, MgO and RE2O3) and non-oxide (AlN, YF, YbF3, CaF2, and FeSi2) sintering additives plays a vital role in densification and microstructure development. For example, dense silicon nitride with a fine grain is required for wear resistance, whereas matrix with elongated reinforcing grain is desirable for improved\ntoughness [11]. Satet et al. [10] examined the effect of MgO +RE2O3 (RE = La, Sm, Yb, Sc, Y, Lu) addition on the mechanical properties and grain growth anisotropy of sintered silicon nitride. It is highlighted that the increase in the ionic radius of RE3+ has resulted in enhanced fracture toughness. This is not only attributed to the increased aspect ratio of β-Si3N4 grains but also to the changed crack growth mechanism from transgranular to intergranular. MgO doped silicon nitride with Gd2O3, La2O3 and La2O3-Lu2O3 combination has exhibited higher toughness and strength when compared with MgO+ (Lu2O3 and Y2O3). This is due to low viscosity oxynitride phase generation in intergranular films (IGFs) or two-grain junctions and formation of larger aspect ratio grains [11,12]. Liu et al. [13] fabricated silicon nitride using 2 wt% MgO and 5wt% Y2O3 through hot pressing at 1800 °C and reported an increase in thermal conductivity, hardness, bending strength and fracture toughness. The enhancement in these properties are attributed to the fine microstructure with more elongated β-Si3N4 grains. Han et al. [14] employed hot pressing to fabricate silicon nitride with or without oscillatory pressure using Al2O3 and Y2O3 as sintering additives. The hardness, fracture toughness, elastic modulus and flexural strength of oscillatory pressure assisted hot pressed ceramics sintered at 1770 °C were 16.04 ± 0.21 GPa, 12.8 ± 0.4MPam1/2, 307 ± 6GPa and 1348 ± 31MPa respectively. Hardness, fracture toughness, elastic modulus and flexural strength for hot pressed (without oscillatory pressure) silicon nitride ceramics were 15.46 ± 0.39 GPa, 10.5 ± 0.1MPam1/2, 304 ± 4GPa and 1128 ± 39MPa respectively.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2019.02.020 Received 15 October 2018; Received in revised form 29 December 2018; Accepted 6 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved.\nT\nThe application of oscillatory pressure reduced the defects and enhanced the densification, and this contributed to the improvement of fracture toughness and strength. Jeong et al. [8] investigated the effect of nanocomposite particles and powder mixing technique on the spark plasma sintering of submicron sized particles of α-Si3N4. The nano-size 5 wt% Y2O3 and 2wt% MgO were added as sintering additives using mechanical treatment (MT). For the same composition, the Si3N4 ceramics sintered at 1600 °C with nanocomposite particles prepared by MT exhibited higher fracture toughness and density compared to the mixture prepared by ball milling. The higher fracture toughness and density of the mechanically treated specimens were attributed to the homogeneous mixture of starting powders and elongated β-Si3N4 grains.\nDense silicon nitride ceramics with excellent thermomechanical properties can be easily produced by commercial methods such as hot pressing (HP), spark plasma sintering (SPS), hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and gas pressure sintering (GPS). The major problems associated with these processing methods are high fabrication cost, small size and relatively simple shapes. In order to achieve low fabrication cost, large size and complex shape with improved thermomechanical properties, pressureless sintering is an ideal fabrication method for the advanced structural ceramics [4,15]. The addition of 0.2 wt% FeSi2 with 3 wt% Al2O3 and 9wt% Y2O3 in pressureless sintered silicon nitride at 1780 °C for 2 h improved the fracture toughness (KIC) and flexural strength [4]. The fracture toughness, thermal conductivity and flexural strength of pressureless sintered silicon nitride (fired at 1800 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere) specimens were 10.3MPam1/2, ~ 60W/mK and 924 ± 54MPa respectively with the addition of 25% Si and ZrO2 +Gd2O3 +MgO as sintering additives in starting powder [15]. Penas et al. [16] developed high-density Si3N4 using pressureless sintering by adding 8 wt% Y2O3 and 1.5 wt% Al2O3 as sintering additives at a sintering temperature of 1800 °C. The study highlighted that the mechanical or thermo-mechanical properties of pressureless sintered Si3N4 were better than hot pressed Si3N4 under the same sintering conditions. A finer microstructure with homogeneous and elongated β-Si3N4 grains was achieved for the pressureless sintered specimens as compared to hot pressed samples.\nThe choice of sintering additives and process parameters certainly can influence the grain growth and phase transformation, which in turn tailors the microstructure leading to varying mechanical properties [11]. The microstructure of sintered ceramics can be regulated by the addition of β-Si3N4 seeds in the starting powder. β-Si3N4 seeds in αSi3N4 powder act as nucleation sites for the growth of β-Si3N4 grains. This enhances the transformation of α- Si3N4 into β- Si3N4 grains during liquid phase sintering. Therefore, the obtained microstructure has a preponderance of high aspect ratio of β- Si3N4 grains, which improves the mechanical properties especially, fracture resistance [17–19]. When β- Si3N4 seeds were added to starting powder, the fracture toughness of gas pressure sintered (at 1850 °C for 6 h under 0.9MPa N2 pressure) Si3N4 was improved from 6.3 to 8.7MPam1/2 [20]. Silicon nitride ceramics sintered with 5 wt% of β -Si3N4 seeds significantly improved α → β phase transformation (from 42% to 84% β -Si3N4) and fracture toughness as compared to silicon nitride sintered without seeds [21]. The effect of micron sized sintering additives (commonly used Al2O3, MgO, and Y2O3) on the mechanical properties and microstructure have been extensively studied for both pressureless and pressure assisted sintering methods [1,3,8,11,15,20,21]. Till date, only a few studies have focused on the mechanical properties and microstructure of micron sized α-Si3N4 and β-Si3N4 containing nanopowder based sintering additives [8,22]. In the present work, dense silicon nitride ceramics have been prepared from commercially available Si3N4 powder by compounding use of nanosized rare-earth oxides (Y2O3 and La2O3) sintering additives using pressureless sintering. The effect of nanosized sintering additives (MgO, Al2O3, Y2O3 and La2O3) on the densification, microstructure, phase transformation, mechanical properties and crack propagation mechanism of silicon nitride ceramics have been\nsystematically investigated. In the present work, the described method for fabrication of dense\nsilicon nitride ceramics using pressureless sintering would be an alternative for developing the advanced ceramics with enhanced thermomechanical properties. The addition of nanosized MgO, Al2O3, Y2O3 and La2O3 in Si3N4 produced a finer microstructure with improved mechanical properties."

The raw α-Si3N4 powder was mixed with nano sintering additives, i.e. Al2O3 (de-agglomerated, 50 nm, Allied High Tech Products, Inc. CA), MgO (99.95% pure, 50 nm), Y2O3 (99.99% pure, 30–45 nm) and La2O3 (99.99% pure, 40–60 nm). The β- Si3N4 powder (99.6% pure, d50 = 0.8 µm, 90–95% β - Si3N4, US Research Nanomaterials, Inc. USA) was mixed with the starting powder for enhancing the growth of βSi3N4. The α-Si3N4, β-Si3N4, MgO, Al2O3, Y2O3 and La2O3 powders with defined compositions were ball milled for 6 h in isopropanol (2- Propanol). The composition of Si3N4-based ceramics with different sintering additives used for fabrication is presented in Table 1.\nPolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (0.9 wt%) was added to the powder mixture as a binding agent [23]. After mixing and drying, the homogeneous powder mixture was sieved through a 100-mesh screen and uni-axially pressed at 125MPa for 2min. The dewaxing (removal of PVA) of green compacts was done at 600 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, the dewaxed compacts were embedded into powder bed of α-Si3N4 in a high-density graphite crucible. A high-temperature graphite furnace with Eurotherm 2404 controller and pyrometer (IMPAC, Germany) was used to sinter the green compacts at 1700 °C for 2 h under 0.1MPa N2 pressure. The compacts were manually heated to 800 °C, and after that, a heating rate of 10 °C/min till 1700 °C was controlled by the Eurotherm controller. After holding the specimens at 1700 °C for 2 h, a cooling rate of 10 °C/min was used till 800 °C and then furnace cooling to ambient temperature was accomplished."

The sintered specimens were ground using a resin bonded diamond wheel (SD54R75B1/3) and polished using the metal bonded diamond disc and diamond slurries (9 µm, 6 µm, 3 µm and 1 µm). The microstructure of the polished samples after etching in conc. HF for 2min, was observed in scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss, EVO MA10). X-ray elemental mapping was done using Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX, Bruker's). The phase analysis of the sintered ceramics was carried out by X-ray diffraction (Ultima IV, Rigaku) using the Cu Kα radiation. Vickers indentation (Z2.5, Zwick Roell) was used to measure the Vickers’ hardness at a load of 49 N with a dwell time of 15 s (a minimum of 8 indentations were selected for the measurement). The indentation fracture toughness (KΙC) was evaluated by Vickers indentation crack length method proposed by using Antis et al.

A 184 nm tip radius Berkovich diamond indenter was used to make an indent at 100 mN load at loading and unloading rate of 1 mN/s. The nanoindenter was calibrated on a silica sample for the measurement of Young's modulus and nanohardness. A quasi-continuous stiffness measurement (QCSM) technique was used for the indentation."

      "text" : "The nano-size sintering additives have high specific surface area and surface energy. More number of additives (due to their nonmetric size) as seen in Fig. 1 surrounds the α-Si3N4 and β-Si3N4 particles in mixing. During sintering, the joining area between the sintering additives and the Si3N4 particles got increased as compared to their micron counter parts [8,25].\nThe growth in β-Si3N4 grains along the length (c-axis) is diffusion controlled and as fast as compared to the growth of diametrical prism faces (a-axis). The β-Si3N4 grain growth and α-Si3N4 to β-Si3N4 transformation depends upon supersaturation, solubility, rate of dissolution, wetting and viscosity. All these can be varied by changing the α-Si3N4 to β-Si3N4 powder ratio in starting powder, altering sintering additives type, size and size distribution of the sintering additives because this lead to change in chemical composition and chemistry of liquid phase [26,27]. Fig. 2 reveals the microstructure of the sintered specimens after etching in concentrated HF for 2min. The addition of β-Si3N4 powder and homogeneous mixing of nano-sized sintering additives in starting powder not only enhanced the phase transformation but also the anisotropic growth of β-Si3N4 grains. This produced a specific interlocking microstructure of β-Si3N4 grains.\nThe microstructure of Si3N4 produced by the addition of MgO and Al2O3 sintering additives are characterized by small and thin β-Si3N4 grains. The addition of RE2O3 changed the chemical composition and chemistry of the oxynitride liquid, which enhanced the growth of βSi3N4 grains. The temperature required for the initiation and completion of α-Si3N4 to β-Si3N4 phase transformation is strongly influenced by the addition of rare earth (RE2O3) oxides because it changes the viscosity of oxynitride liquid. The viscosity of oxynitride liquid tends to decrease with increasing in the ionic radius of RE3+ as per Lofaj et al. [28]. The addition of Y2O3 (4Mg4Al5Y composition) produced high\nviscosity glass phase, which reduced the rate of grain growth along caxis and led to coarser grains. The La2O3 addition (4Mg4Al5La composition) generated low viscosity glass phase, which enhanced the mass transport and dissolution of small grains in liquid phase by Oswaldripening mechanism. The microstructure of 4Mg4Al5La composition is characterized by preponderance of finer β-Si3N4 grains.\nThe α → β-Si3N4 phase transformation during sintering occurs by (і) dissolution of the α phase and saturation of the oxynitride liquid phase and re-precipitation out of large Si3N4 grains (іі) Si and N ions transport through oxynitride liquid phase, and (ііі) attachment and growth onto existing β-Si3N4 grains or particles [9,11]. At high temperature (> 1400 °C), the liquid phase produced by the addition of nano-sized RE2O3 particles with nano-sized Al2O3 and MgO, increased the wettability and wrapping of α-Si3N4 particles which enhanced the dissolution rate of α-Si3N4 particles via solution–reprecipitation process. The enhanced dissolution rate and more nucleation sites by addition of βSi3N4 particles have provided additional time for β-Si3N4 grains to increase their size and number. The small RE3+ radius RE2O3 (RE3+ = Y = 0.89 Å) have higher stability of RE3+ in oxynitride glass and also promotes the attachment of Si and N to the prismatic plane surface because of high cationic field strength (CFS) of RE3+ produced larger diameter β-Si3N4 grains (coarser) compared to large RE3+ radius RE2O3 (RE3+ = La = 1.06 Å).\nThe elemental mapping of sintered Si3N4 ceramics is shown in Fig. 3(a-d). All the samples exhibit a uniform distribution of Si and N in the matrix. These elemental mappings also show some traces of\nsintering additives in the matrix which may be below the detection limit of XRD [19]."

      "text" : "The XRD patterns of the starting powder (α-Si3N4 powder with α content ≥ 95%) and the sintered Si3N4 ceramics with nano-sized sintering additives are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). XRD analysis of sintered Si3N4 with different nano-size sintering additives showed the complete transformation of α-Si3N4 into β-Si3N4 without the existence of α-Si3N4 and any other phases of sintering additives.\nAt sintering temperature, the sintering additives reacted with αSi3N4 particles and the nascent SiO2 present on α-Si3N4 particles and formed a low-temperature eutectic phase, which crystallized at grain boundaries on cooling [29]. The transformation of α-Si3N4 to β-Si3N4 takes place via dissolution-diffusion-precipitation process and this depends upon the viscosity and chemical composition of oxynitride liquid phase, which is governed by the sintering additives [3,14].\nThe addition of nano-size sintering additives has enhanced the dissolution rate of α-Si3N4 particles in the oxynitride liquid, which has, in turn, resulted in more precipitation of β-Si3N4 grains according to the following equation\n+ + + …[ Si N ] [SiO ] [M O ] [ Si N ] [M Si O N]3 4 2 x y 3 4 (2)\nWhere MxOy is metal oxide used as sintering additive. In this work,\nMxOy signifies the nano-sized MgO, Al2O3, Y2O3 and La2O3. The enhanced dissolution rate, higher atom diffusion rate and more precipitation of β-Si3N4 grains resulted in complete transformation of αSi3N4 to β-Si3N4."

      "text" : "The highest density of 3.17 g cm−3 was achieved for 4Mg4Al5Y composition, whereas a density of 3.12 g cm−3 was obtained for the 4Mg4Al composition. The density obtained in the present case is comparable to spark plasma sintered Si3N4 [30]. The addition of nanosized sintering additives (Al2O3, MgO, La2O3 and Y2O3) enhanced the densification of Si3N4 ceramics. This can be attributed to the complete wetting and wrapping of silicon nitride grains and grain boundary phases by sintering additives during sintering. The oxynitride liquid formed by the reaction of sintering additives, SiO2 and fine Si3N4 particles enhanced the densification by particle rearrangement followed by dissolution-diffusion-precipitation process. The combination of particle rearrangement and dissolution-diffusion-precipitation process resulted in densification and complete phase transformation [31].\nThe micro-hardness of Si3N4 (4Mg4Al composition) is 15.5 ( ± 0.3) GPa. The addition of 5 wt% nano-sized Y2O3 in the starting powder has achieved the highest hardness of 16.7 ( ± 0.2) GPa. Fig. 5 represents the load – displacement of the sintered ceramics with the different additive compositions. At constant load, the indentation depth varied with composition because of the hardness of the sintered sample. The Young's modulus has been measured with respect to the indentation depth (Fig. 6). Mostly researchers have used Oliver and Pharr method for calculating Young's modulus (the slope of the unloading curve) [32,33]; however, in the present work QCSM technique was employed to have the accurate measurement of Young's modulus, and nanohardness.\nThe nano-sized (MgO, Al2O3, and Y2O3) additives doped sample resulted in the highest nanohardness of 21.0 ( ± 2.2) GPa. The combination of MgO, Al2O3, and Y2O3 accelerated the densification and phase transformation, which has resulted in increased hardness and Young's modulus. Due to the less absorption of small RE3+ radius RE2O3 at the prismatic surface of Si3N4 surface and high cationic field strength (CFS) of RE3+, the viscosity of oxynitride glassy phases is higher, and bonding of oxynitride glassy phases within the intergranular films (IGFs) and neighbouring grains is strong and highly dense [10–12,34]. The small RE3+ radius RE2O3 (RE3+ = Y = 0.89 Å) composition showed highest hardness compared to other compositions because of the highest CFS of Y3+. Similar trend of hardness change with RE3+ ionic radius was observed by Tatarko et al. [34] for monolithic and nanocomposite of Si3N4 where the hardness value decreased with an increasing RE3+ ionic radius or decreasing CFS.\nFig. 7 shows the Vickers indent made on 4Mg4Al5Y bearing composition to evaluate the fracture toughness. Cracks were evident originating from the apex of the indent, and the crack length for each samples were measured. The crack length found out to be 65.47 ± 0.66 µm, 54.92 ± 0.71 µm, 52.63 ± 0.41 µm and 54.88 ± 0.44 µm respectively for 4Mg4Al, 4Mg4Al5Y, 4Mg4Al5La and 4Mg4Al2.5Y2.5La bearing compositions respectively. Using Eq. (1), the fracture toughness obtained were 5.43 ± 0.11MPam1/2,\n7.43 ± 0.15MPam1/2, 8.00 ± 0.09MPam1/2 and 7.48 ± 0.02MPa m1/2 respectively for 4Mg4Al, 4Mg4Al5Y, 4Mg4Al5La and 4Mg4Al2.5Y2.5La bearing compositions respectively. The 4Mg4Al5La composition exhibited higher fraction of crack deflection at grain boundaries and interlocking of grains, which results in high toughness.\nThe fracture toughness of silicon nitride ceramics is dependent on\nthe crack deflection at the glass|grain interface. The aspect ratio of grains and interfacial strength between grains and the surrounding phase are directly influenced by the presence of specific RE2O3, which have a substantial impact on the crack propagation mechanism. The interfacial (glass|grain interface) strength in large size RE3+ cation (La3+) is weak because of the higher coverage of the Si3N4 grains and a\nhigher tendency to bond with nitrogen on the prism plane of Si3N4 [35]. The addition of La2O3 produced the high aspect ratio grains with weaker interfacial strength, and this has increased the fracture toughness but simultaneously has decreased some of the mechanical properties [10,36]. In case of Y2O3 (4Mg4Al5Y composition) the interfacial bonding is strong because of high CFS so crack deflection should not occur at the glass|grain interface. The change of high CFS RE3+ (Y2O3) to low CFS RE3+ (La2O3) results in significant reduction in the interfacial strength and this lead to onset enhancement of frictional energy dispersion mechanism and increased fracture toughness. The large\ndebonding length and frequent pull-out events were observed by Satet al el. [35] in case of sintered ceramic with larger RE3+. The crack propagation mechanism for strong (Y2O3) and weak (La2O3) glass|grain interface is schematically shown in Fig. 8(a-b). However, the mechanical properties of the silicon nitride ceramics sintered with nano-sized sintering additives were higher than the ceramics sintered with the micron sized sintering additives [30,37].\nThe microstructure reveals the elongated grains in each composition. However, the final mechanical properties are governed by the glass|grain interface. The addition of nano-sized Y2O3 produced strong\nglass|grain interface, which leads to transgranular crack propagation mechanism (broken elongated grains and low crack deflection at the interface) as evident in Fig. 9(a). Similar mechanism for crack propagation can be proposed for 4Mg4Al bearing composition as revealed from Fig. 9(b).\nOn the other hand, the addition of nano-sized La2O3 produced weak glass|grain interface with intergranular crack propagation mechanism (high crack deflection at the interface and more grain bridges) as shown in Fig. 9(c), which results in increased energy for crack growth, and so the fracture toughness. The addition of 2.5 wt% of nano-sized Y2O3 and 2.5 wt% of nano-sized La2O3 led to an improved hardness, Young's modulus and fracture toughness because of the inter-transgranular crack propagation mechanism (Fig. 9d). The compounding use of RE2O3 with small and large RE3+ radius significantly modified the grain boundary phases by lowering down the viscosity, improved homogenization, increased diffusion, and inter-transgranular crack propagation mechanism [12,38]. The homogenous and low viscosity grain boundary phase lead to improved mechanical properties compared to singular rare earth oxide (RE2O3) doped ceramic. The density, hardness, Young's modulus, and fracture toughness for all the compositions are summarized in Table 2.\nThe effect of micron sized sintering additives (amount, and type) along with the sintering conditions on phase transformation, hardness and fracture toughness using pressureless sintering is listed in Table 3. Compared to these micron-sized additives, the nano-sized additives improved the mechanical properties substantially. Thus, the used nanosized sintering additives are perfectly suitable for improving the mechanical properties of silicon nitride ceramics."

The effects of different sintering additives and their compositions on densification, phase transformation, microstructure development and mechanical properties were studied in detail. Following conclusions are drawn from this work:\n1) The addition of nano-sized sintering additives enhanced the densification, phase transformation, and produced a specific interlocking microstructure. The nano-sized sintering additives were found to be effective in improving the density, grain growth, phase transformation and mechanical properties.\n2) XRD analysis confirmed the complete transformation of α-Si3N4 into β-Si3N4 during sintering in all the compositions tested. Si3N4 ceramic sintered with 4Mg4Al5Y exhibited high hardness, whereas high fracture toughness is attained for 4Mg4Al5La composition. The hardness of 4Mg4Al5Y composition was 16.7 ± 0.2 GPa. The weaker interfacial strength and high aspect ratio of β-Si3N4 grains in 4Mg4Al5La bearing composition Si3N4 ceramics have yielded increased fracture toughness and reduced hardness.\n3) The addition of nano-sized Y2O3 and La2O3 produced strong and weak glass|grain interface respectively. The fracture toughness of 4Mg4Al2.5Y2.5La bearing composition Si3N4 was higher than that of 4Mg4Al and 4Mg4Al5Y. The density, microhardness, nanohardness Young's modulus and fracture toughness of 4Mg4Al2.5Y2.5La was 3.16 g cm−3, 16.4 (± 0.5) GPa, 20.6 (± 1.8) GPa, 246.1 (± 14.4) GPa, and 7.48 (± 0.02) MPam1/2 respectively. 4) The compounding use of RE2O3 with small and large RE3+ radii significantly modified the grain boundary phase by lowering its viscosity, which leads to improved mechanical properties compared to singular RE2O3 doped Si3N4 ceramics."

The effects of such sintering additives on the phase transformation, mechanical properties and microstructure of silicon nitride were investigated. XRD analysis of sintered silicon nitride with these sintering additives have shown the complete transformation of α-Si3N4 into β-Si3N4. The silicon nitride ceramics sintered with nano-sized additives (4MgO-4Al2O3–5La2O3) have exhibited the highest fracture toughness. This is not only due to the weak glass|grain interface but also due to the formation of high aspect ratio grains (β-Si3N4). Superior mechanical properties of Si3N4 can be obtained by way of adding small and large RE3+ radii RE2O3 (Y2O3 and La2O3) together than the addition of single RE2O3.",
