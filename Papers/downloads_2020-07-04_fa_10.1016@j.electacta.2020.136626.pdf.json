      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The pseudocapacitive charge storage materials development requires large redox sites associated\nto larger surface area and their capability to increase ionic insertion over and above electric\ndouble layer construction. [1-3] There are numerous strategies implemented to enhance surface\narea by tuning morphology of materials at nanoscale [4-5] for example; the layered or spinel\nmorphology including porous network is highly favorable for ionic insertion.[6-9] The three-\ndirectional architecture comprising 1D and 2D nanostructures ultimately boost surface area,\nincrease wettability of electrolyte as well as increases the surface contact.[10-12]\nThe transition metal oxide nanomaterials such as RuO2, NiOH, CuO, MoO3, V2O5 etc. are\nhighly efficient electrode materials ensured pesudocapacitive storage.[13-17] Among all the\ntransition metal oxides, the MnO2 is widely studied due to its electrochemically reversible and fast surface redox reactions arises from Mn-O bond length with multiple oxidation states. It exhibits highest theoretical Specific capacity value of 1300 Fg-1.[18] Moreover, the MnO2 has crystallographically polymorphic phases which exhibits numbers of interstitial site by ordered\nstacking of edge and corner sharing of MnO6 octahedral unit. These interstitial sites can accommodate more ions via surface absorption-desorption as well as insertion and de-\ninsertion.[19-20] However α-MnO2 is highly attracting electrode materials among the different polymorphs of MnO2 for pseudocapacitive charge storage due to its largest spinel sizes (2x2) and (1x1) of 0.46 nm and 0.18nm respectively that are situated in the direction parallel to the c-axis\nof the tetragonal unit cell.[21-23] Therefore, the spinel structure would be highly beneficial for\nthe intercalation of ions into the MnO2 structure. It has advantage of persistent exceptional pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism via insertion-de-insertion of ions into the structure\neven in the absence of porous network.\n5\nAdditionally, engineering the 3D architectures composed of 1D and 2D nanostructures\nprovides limited mechanical degradation, viable volume expansion during stability and the direct\ncurrent pathway in the electrochemical energy storage devices [24-25]. Recently, Si Xu deng et al. has developed α-MnO2 nanorod/graphene exhibiting the specific capacitance of 218 Fg -1 with capacitance retention 94% up to 1000 cycle.[26] Further, the 3D α-MnO2 nanorod/graphene has demonstrated 360 Fg-1 Specific capacity with high 93% capacitance retention after 10,000\ncycle.[27] The unique approach of preparing the high surface area α-MnO2 nanorods by DC magnetron sputtering has exhibited specific capacitance of 346 Fg-1 with 86% capacitance\nretention after 1500 cycle.[28] Thus the building blocks of 3D nanostructures with the fully\nexposed active edges oriented in the preferred manner have great potential to enrich the specific\ncapacity and rate capability. Further improved performance of 3D MnO2 nanostructures is feasible through hybridization, functionalization and composite formation with carbon\nderivatives.[29-32]\nThe supercapacitor performance is highly depends on its working temperature which\ncontrols the charge storage capacity and efficiency. The external thermal energy considerably\naffects the conductivity, kinematics such as ions mobility, diffusion rate of electrolyte and\nsurface modification.[33-35] The single-walled carbon nanotube film electrodes has\ndemonstrated an influence of kinetics and the diffusion mechanism of the ions with respect to growing temperature from 25oC to 100oC.[36] Wang et al. has reported two-times rise in capacitance up to 70oC in MnO2/carbon nanofibers composite along with 10% loss in cyclic stability.[37] Likewise, ultrafine MnO2 nanobelt has exhibited the capacitance increment with temperature from 0oC to 50oC.[38] However, high thermal energy is noticeably weakening the\ncyclic stability of the device. The appropriate strategy of assembling various nanostructures is\n6\nhighly required to develop pesudocapacitive storage and sustain high stability in the variable\ntemperature regime by reversible expansion and contraction of electrode volume.[34,35]\nHerein, we report the preparation of urchin like morphology of spinel α-MnO2 nanorods\non CNO surface (MnO2NR@CNO) using simple, low-cost, ecofriendly, template free, wet chemical method. The temperature dependent supercapacitor performance of MnO2NR@CNO exhibits growth in the overall specific capacity from 202 Cg-1 to 363 Cg-1 at current density 0.3 Ag-1 from temperature 4 oC to 70 oC respectively. The two fold increment in energy density and power density from 4 oC to 70 oC with 76% cyclic stability retention after 1000 cycle at 70oC is\nrealized. The obtained results clearly determined an influence of the temperature on the\nelectrochemical performance via the kinematics reforms."

      "text" : "The α-MnO2 structure is more favorable for supercapacitor performance compared to β-\nMnO2, γ-MnO2 owings to their larger spinel sizes (2x2) and (1x1). In the absence of the porous\nnetwork, these spinel sizes provide the lodging for ions insertion. Therefore the electrochemical\ncharge storage of MnO2 intensely depends on spinel size of various phases as reported earlier. [19a] The purity and crystal structure of CNO and MnO2 NR@CNO were carried out by XRD and Raman spectra (Figure 1a-b). The two prominent diffraction peaks of CNO at 25o and 48o\nrepresent (002) and (001) planes respectively that approves the highly graphitic nature.[19b] The\nseven diffraction peaks of MnO2 NR@CNO representing planes (110), (310), (211), (301), (411), (600), and (521) are confirming the body center tetragonal crystal structure with lattice\nparameter a = 9.7875 and c = 2.8600 validate α-MnO2 (JCPDS No. 44-0141).[39] The absence of (001) and (200) planes in the XRD pattern indicates successful covering of MnO2 rods on CNO surface (SEM image Figure S1a) and subsequent formation of larger (200x2) spinel’s\nrespectively. The crystalline size of α-MnO2 rod is 12.8 nm estimated by Scherrer equation at (211) plane. The Figure S1b clearly shows Raman spectra of pristine CNO with two obvious peak at 1349 cm-1 and 1594 cm-1 corresponding to D-band for amorphous carbon and G peak assign to SP2 hybridization carbon atom in graphitic phase with intensity ratio (ID/IG) of about 0.92. However, it increases to 1.15 for MnO2@CNO because of large disordering, defects or impurities as expected from MnO2. The Raman spectra of MnO2NR@CNO (Figure 1b) exhibits six crystalline peak at 182 cm-1, 272 cm-1, 388 cm-1, 500 cm-1, 575 cm-1, 635 cm-1 corresponds to\n9\nα-MnO2.[27] The high frequency bands at 575 cm -1 and 635 cm-1 correspond to Ag mode of vibration, the displacement of oxygen atom relative to manganese atom and Mn-O vibrations\nperpendicular to the direction of the MnO6 octahedral double chains respectively.[22] It supports a tetragonal hollandite-type framework of interstitial space consisting of (2×2) spinels.[23] The low frequency Raman bands at 182 cm-1, 388 cm-1 links to the translational motion of MnO6 octahedral and MnO2 bending vibration. [40] The inset of Figure 1b shows typical spinel structure of α-MnO2.\nThe FTIR spectra (Figure 1c) reveals that the functional groups present in pristine CNO\nwere disappeared in MnO2NR@CNO and further several new peaks are detected. The band at 3384 cm-1 and 1573 cm-1 represents stretching and bending vibration of surface hydroxyl group of (Mn-OH) and adsorb moisture (H-O-H) respectively. The peaks at 452 cm-1, 512 cm-1, 557 cm-1 ascribe to Mn-O vibrations of the MnO6 octahedral framework and band appeared at 721 cm-1, 1417 cm-1 corresponds to vibration mode of Mn-O-Mn bonding in α-MnO2.[18] Furthermore, the percentage of weight loss was measured by TGA analysis in air atmosphere\n(Figure 1d). The pristine CNO TGA profile shows drastic weight loss (89%) from temperature 500 oC to 630 oC in a single step; whereas, the MnO2NR@CNO confirms less weight loss (12%) across the temperature range up to 800 oC in the three steps. The initial loss is observed up to 200 oC owing to dehydration of the physically adsorbed surface water. Further, the second weight loss is found between temperatures 300 oC to 450 oC as a result of oxygen generation through chemical and structural conversion of MnO2. At last, the weight loss at temperature from 600 oC to 700 oC is arises from combustion of CNO. The calculated weight ratio of carbon and MnO2 from TGA is about 15 confirming the 0.88 gm of MnO2 accommodated by 60 mg of CNO. The morphological and structural investigations of MnO2NR@CNO were performed by FESEM,\n10\nTEM and STEM-EDS. The low magnification FESEM image of MnO2NR@CNO (Figure 2a) clearly shows the urchin like structure. Further at high magnification (Figure 2b) exemplify\nurchin structure composed of MnO2 nanorods radially grown on CNO surface and emanate from the center. The vertically aligned nanorods are highly consistent with the diameter ranging from\n14-17 nm. Further, majority surface of carbon nano-onion is under the concealment of MnO2 nanorods. The TEM image (Figure S2a) shows the dark region at the center highlighting the\npresence of CNO and Figure S2b elucidate HRTEM image of CNO present in the\nMnO2NR@CNO. Further, TEM at high magnification (Figure 2c) noticeably distinguish the uniform rods of lengths 200-250 nm with diameters 14-17 nm along with its transparent nature.\nFurthermore, the HRTEM image of single rod (Figure 2d) elucidates the lamellar structure\nensuing unidirectional crystal growth without noticing any defect and line dislocation. The IFFT\n(Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) image (Figure 2e) of selected square region of Figure 2d\nillustrates the inter planer distance of 0.23 nm corresponding to d-spacing of (211) plane. The\nintensity profile of nanorod along the green line marked in Figure 2e is indicated in Figure 2f.\nThe SAED Pattern (Figure 2g) exhibits the α-MnO2 polycrystalline nature related to high\nsurface area with low lattice energy. Thus the maximum utilization of electrode material is\nexpected through ions insertion/exertion process.[16] The Figure 2h shows the high-angle\nannular dark-field (HAAFD) images of single nanorod. Furthermore, the elemental mapping\n(Figure 2i and 2j) of MnO2NR@CNO by STEM-(EDX) exhibits uniform distribution of Mn and O in α˗MnO2 nanorod.\nAdditionally, the chemical composition and respective oxidation states of Mn and O is\nanalyzed by XPS as shown in Figure 3. The Figure 3a shows survey scan of MnO2NR/CNO in wide range of binding energy conforming existence of C, O and Mn without any impurity. The\n11\nthree characteristic peaks are observed at 284.7 eV, 529.6 eV and 642.2 eV corresponds to C 1s,\nO 1s and Mn 2p respectively. The spin energy separation of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 is found to be ∼11.53 eV. The Figure 3b shows high resolution Mn 2p spectra and deconvoluted it into four peaks at 642.2 eV, 643.9 eV, 653.5 eV, 654.99 eV assigning Mn3+ (2p3/2), Mn 4+ (2p3/2) and Mn 3+ (2p1/2), and Mn 4+ (2p1/2) respectively. It is clearly seen that Mn 3+ contribution of both 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 is larger than Mn 4+ suggesting that the faster reaction rate results more Mn3+ content in MnO2. A higher content of Mn 3+ in MnO2 can lead to a better electrochemical performance, due to the single electron occupation in the σ*-orbital (eg) of Mn 3+.[41-42] The deconvoluted C-1s spectra shows contribution of three peaks at 284.7 eV, 286.2eV and 288.6 eV corresponding to\nC-C, C-OH and COOH group as shown in Figure 3c. Additionally, the O 1s spectra (Figure 3d)\nis fitted to the three peaks centered at 529.6 eV, 531.7 eV and 533.6 eV signifying the Mn-O,\nMn-O-Mn and –OH respectively. The oxygen functional groups in MnO2NR@CNO plays significant role in wettability of electrolyte, enhance redox activity and hence increase in\nSpecific capacity.[43]\nThe temperature dependent cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at scan rate 10 mVs-1\nin 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte is shown in Figure 4a. The area under the curve and its current response signifies the total charge contribution from three component: (i) faradic contribution of diffusion controlled Na+ (0.095nm) insertion, (ii) faradic contribution originated from the charge\ntransfer process with surface atom and (iii) non-faradic contribution by electric double layer.[44] The CV curve at 4oC exhibits ideal pseudocapacitive nature in absence of any redox peak as\nreported by lee and goodenough [45] (eq-1). Further, the distinct behavior is observed by changing temperature from 4oC to 70oC. The anodic and cathodic current response is increased\nwith the corresponding redox peaks at potential between 0.4 to 0.5V and 0.8 to 0.9V\n12\nrespectively. The redox peak clearly indicates the fast electrochemical reactivity of Na+ ions on the active surface of MnO2 rods. [46-47] Moreover, it is possible to intercalate/de-intercalate Na + ions into larger spinel of MnO2 structures due to their smaller ionic radius (0.095 nm) (eq.2). However, the asymmetry between anodic and cathodic peaks point-out the quasi-reversible\ncharge storage mechanism.\n2 2( ) ( )surface surfaceMnO Na e MnO Na + − − ++ + ←→ …………..…(1)\n2MnO Na e MnOONa + −+ + ←→ ………………………(2)\nMoreover, the minor polarization can be observed by small over-potential redox peaks gap at all temperatures. The CV curves at high temperatures 50oC and 70oC (Figure S3) clearly display faradic process up to high scan rate (200 mVs-1) than low temperatures 4oC and 27oC owing to\nfast ionic mobility and conductivity. As a result, large accessibility of active surface region along\nwith improved ionic diffusion into the larger spinel’s of α-MnO2 nanorods. The specific capacity of 349 Cg-1 (Figure 4b) at high temperature 70oC is achieved at lower scan rate 2 mVs-1, which is almost 45% larger than the value (211 Cg-1) at 4oC. The charge discharge (CD) curve at current density 300 mAg-1 is shown in Figure 4c. The kinetics properties were examined by\nusing CD curve i.e. the slop and plateau region by adsorption-insertion model at different.[48]\nThe plateau capacity increasing more rapidly from 4% to 73% and the sloping capacity drastically decreases from 85% to 24% at 4oC to 70oC respectively. It clearly demonstrates\nhigher surface adsorption and desorption at low temperatures, however improved ionic insertion\nat higher temperatures.\nFurthermore, the temperature dependent CD curve at various current densities 0.5 to\n30 Ag-1 (Figure S4) shows plateau region decreases linearly with the current density due to fast\nionic mobility as well as rapid process hindering adsorption/desorption and insertion/de-\n13\ninsertion. The temperature dependent Specific capacity with respect to various current densities\nis shown in Figure 4d. The obtained capacitance is enhanced by almost 55% at temperature 70oC (363 Cg-1) than 4oC (202 Cg-1), close to the values calculated from CV curve.\nThe better insight of CD kinetics can be evaluated from the CD test in Figure\n4e.[49] In general, total capacitance (C) has contribution of both pseudocapacitive i.e. the rate\nindependent component (k1) and diffusion control component (k2) as shown in eq-3.\nC = k1 + k2 t 1/2 ………….(3)\nwhere t is discharge time.\nThe component k1 can be obtained by the extrapolating the linear part of CD kinetics to intersect the vertical axis. The Figure 4e shows the temperature dependent plot of total capacitance vs square root discharge time (t). The k1 are found to be 72 Cg -1, 96 Cg-1, 122 Cg-1 and 141 Cg-1 and the k2 are 122 Cg -1, 146 Cg-1, 187 Cg-1, 221 Cg-1 at different temperatures as shown in the Figure 4e.\nIn addition, the total charge and surface charge (qs) stored in electrode material are\nestimated by trasatti method.[50-52] It is determined from the intercept of linear plot ‘q’ vs (scan rate)-1/2 at various temperatures (Figure 5a). Analogy of this, the total charge (qt) including outer and inner surface of MnO2NR@CNO can be obtained from the intercept of linear plot ‘1/q’ vs (scan rate)1/2 (Figure 5b). The linear region in Figure 5a represents a limited diffusion process.\nThe obtain qs and qt (Figure 4f) are linearly increased with growing temperature, the values are listed in the Table-1. The charge stored in inner surface including spinel in MnO2NR@CNO is the difference between qt and qs.\nThe external conditions have major impact on the electrochemical energy storage system,\nespecially the temperature of system effectively modify the rate of kinetics, the ions mobility,\n14\ncharge transfer resistance and conductivity of electrode.[53] The electrochemical impedance (EI)\nmeasurements were carried out in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 1MHz (Figure S5),\nwhich is a power full tool to analyze ionic and electron transport kinematics into the electrode\nmaterials. The EI spectra can be divided into three distinct regions i.e. low, mid and high\nfrequency region. The low frequency region clearly shows decreasing slope of line with respect\nto growing temperature. This indicates transfer of electric double layer storage to\npseudocapacitive storage due to fast access of electrode materials by electrolytes. The intercept\nof semi-circle on real axis at high frequency (Figure 6a) represents the equivalent series\nresistance (Rs) (values are listed in table 1), which is decreasing by dropping the ionic resistance of electrolyte and intrinsic or contact resistance of electrode material with raising temperature.\nThe Nyquist plot noticeably shows a semi-circle around the mid-frequency region at temperature 70oC corresponds to low charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the respective values of Rct with temperatures are listed in Table 1. The bode plot (Figure 6b) illustrates the phase angels 71o, 68 o, 65 o and 62 o at low frequency representing capacitive behavior. The knee frequency (fo) at 45 o phase angle holds equal capacitive and the resistive impedance. Although, higher the knee\nfrequency represent the higher rate capability and lesser the relaxation time as listed in table 1.\nTheir corresponding relaxation times (τ=1/fo) linearly increase so as the power density with\nelevated temperature. Moreover, the Warburg diffusive resistance observed from the broad peak at 4oC, which is completely, disappears at 70oC. This directs lowering the diffusive resistance\nwith improved temperature that effectively enhances the electrochemical accessibility of electrolytic ions as well as the performance of the device. Furthermore, it is found that at 4oC the impedance is 379 Ω, which is 3 times higher than 123 Ω at 70 oC at low frequency region,\nindicated improved conductivity.\n15\nThe fast reaction kinetics as indicated by small diffusive resistance (σ) according to\nequation (4) is estimated at various temperatures.[54]\n1 2(1 )wZ jσω −= − (4)\nThe electrolyte ion diffusion resistance (σ) was calculated by slop of real part of impedance (Z’) versus the reciprocal of the square root of frequency (ω−1/2) at various temperatures as shown in Figure 6c. The obtained σ values are decreased from 39 Ωs-1/2 to 11 Ωs-1/2 at 4oC to 70oC\nrespectively. In the continuation, the diffusion coefficient can be calculated using equation (5).\n12 2 *2\n1\n2\nRT\nn F A D C σ\n  =  \n  (5)\nwhere, R is universal gas constant, T is temperature, n is charge transfer number, F is faraday\nconstant, A is area of electrode, D is diffusion coefficient and C* is concentration of electrolyte.\nFurthermore, the ionic mobility is related to diffusion coefficient and can be calculated according\nto Nerst-Einstein equation (6) [55].\nµ=eD/KbT (6)\nwhere, Kb is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, D is diffusion coefficient and e is charge on electron. It is found that diffusion coefficient and mobility of ions continuously\nincreases with the temperature as shown in Figure 6d and listed in table-1. It is related to more\nhighly ionic constructiveness of electrolyte that tremendously boosts the ions accessibility in\nMnO2NR@CNP surface.\nMoreover, the stability of supercapacitor is a major concern at various temperatures due\nto continue heating and cooling environment. The electrochemical stability of MnO2NR@CNP was carried out at high current density 5 Ag-1 (Figure 7). Remarkably, the 93% and 95% capacitance retention were found after 1000 cycle at 4oC and 27oC respectively. Moreover the\n16\ncapacitance retention at 50oC and 70oC were obtained 85% and 78%. The inset of figure 6 shows\nthe coulombic efficiency above 100% signifies fast kinematics. The growing temperature\nreduces the stability due to increasing kinematics and improves diffusion process results\nelectrode materials degradation."

      "text" : "In summary, we report the simple strategy to develop urchin like structure comprising α-MnO2\nnanorod on the CNO surface for temperature dependence pseudocapacitor application. The\nMnO2NR@CNO exhibits excellence electrochemical charge storage performance at various temperatures. The 1.5 fold increment of Specific capacity is realized from 202 Cg-1 to 362 Cg-1 from 4oC to 70oC respectively. However relatively cyclic stability of about 78% after 1000 cycles is observed at 70oC, which is just 17% less than at 4oC. This state-of-the-art three-\ndimensional urchin architecture of α-MnO2 nanomaterials has great potential to develop\nsustainable pseudocapacitors."
