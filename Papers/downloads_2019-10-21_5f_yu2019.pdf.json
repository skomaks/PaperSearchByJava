      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Human activity, especially consumption of fossil fuels, is altering the planet [1]. In October 2018, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is 406.9 ppm, showing an increasing trend at a current annual rate of 2.1 ppm per year [2]. High level of CO2 causes concerns about global warming and other ecological problems [3], which has prompted research on converting abundant CO2 into value-added chemicals such as ether, alcohol and acid [4–7]. However, the high chemical inertness of CO2 challenges its conversion. Catalytic hydrogenation and catalytic reforming of CO2 are two typical approaches, but the requirements for high temperature and high pressure limit their practical application [8].\nElectrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) can proceed at room temperature and under ambient conditions, and achieve target products selectively by applying various electrocatalysts [9]. ECR exhibits significant advantages [10], such as environmental compatibility and mild operating conditions, and therefore has attracted intensive research interest since the first report around 30 years ago [11]. Despite notable improvement, more efforts need to be invested for low overpotential, high efficiency, selectivity and stability.\nECR takes place at the interface of electrolyte and electrode, and\nElectroanalytical Chemistry nese Academy of Science,\nChen), lmguo@ciac.ac.cn\n9\nion and hosting by Elsevier B.V. o\nmainly goes through the following three steps [12,13]:\n(1) chemical adsorption of CO2 onto the surface of an electrocatalyst; (2) break of C¼O bonds and/or formation of C–H bonds by electron\nand proton transfer; (3) desorption of product species from catalyst surface [14].\nThe half electrochemical reaction of CO2 reduction and corresponding standard electrode potentials (vs. SHE) are listed below [15]. It should be noted that these electrode potentials are calculated based on the standard Gibbs energies of the reactants, so they merely reflect the thermodynamics rather than the kinetics of the reactions.\nCO2 þ 2Hþþ 2e → HCOOH E0¼ 0.250 V (1) CO2 þ 2Hþþ 2e → CO þ H2O E0¼ 0.106 V (2) 2CO2 þ 2Hþþ 2e →H2C2O4 E0¼ 0.500 V (3) CO2 þ 4Hþþ 4e → HCHO þ H2O E0¼ 0.070 V (4) CO2 þ 6Hþþ 6e → CH3OHþ 2H2O E0¼ 0.016 V (5) CO2 þ 8Hþþ 8e → CH4þ 2H2O E0¼ 0.169 V (6) 2CO2 þ 12Hþþ 12e → CH2CH2þ 4H2O E0¼ 0.064 V (7) 2CO2 þ 12Hþþ 12e → C2H5OHþ 3H2O E0¼ 0.084 V (8)\nAs can be seen, CO2 undergo different types of electrochemical reduction, either a 2-e reduction into HCOOH, CO or H2C2O4 (Eqs. (1)–(3)), a 4-e reduction into HCHO (Eq. (4)), or a multiple electron\nn behalf of KeAi. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license\nprocess into CH3OH, CH4, CH2CH2 or C2H5OH (Eqs. (5)–(8)). In most cases, ECR generates mixed products containing several species. The pathways of CO2 reduction are strongly dependent on the electrocatalysts applied. Besides, electrolyte acts as a medium to transfer electrons and protons, and can greatly influence the performance of electrocatalysts. In aqueous solution for instance, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs as a competitive side reaction, which impedes the Faradaic efficiency of desired products. Another challenge comes from the low solubility of CO2 in water.\nIn the following sections, we first introduce the apparatus setups for ECR and metrics commonly used to evaluate catalysts. Then we summarize the possible reaction pathways and current understanding, as well as methods applied for mechanism study. Furthermore, the size and structural factors that influence ECR catalysts, mainly onmetal and metal oxide nanoparticles, are discussed from the aspects of both experimental and computational progress of recent research. Thereafter, we review the advances of non-metal and single-atom catalysts in ECR. Finally, the challenges and outlook of CO2 reduction are proposed to offer a perspective for the CO2 conversion. Compared with other published ECR reviews, we summarize previous research works and recent advances in this review, from the perspective of fundamental principle in electrochemical process rather than material itself. We aim to provide insights for catalyst design at atomic and nano scale based on the underlying rules such as interface and structural effect."

      "text" : "H-type electrolysis cell commonly used for ECR consists of two compartments separated by anion exchange membrane, illustrated in Fig. 1a. Working electrode and reference electrode are located in the cathode chamber, and the counter electrode in the anode chamber. The ion exchange membrane prevents the transport of reduced products onto counter electrode, in which way further oxidization may occur. Ar gas is first purged into the electrolyte to remove dissolved oxygen, then CO2 is purged until saturated. The gaseous products such as CO and CH4 can be analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is usually applied to analyze liquid product, but the existence of water may interfere the results [16]. Liquid product can also be examined by GC, but water damages the column and the salt from electrolyte may block the capillary."

      "text" : "Flow cells can overcome the barrier of mass-transport in H-type cells, and are recently applied in ECR studies [17]. Membrane-based flow-cells, as shown in Fig. 1b, are more widely used. The setup contains polymer electrolyte membrane that separates cathode and anode, with porous gas\ndiffusion electrodes (GDE) on both sides of the membrane for prolonged contact between catalysts and CO2. Another approach is a microfluidic cell as demonstrated in Fig. 1c, which was first reported by Kennis group in 2010 [18]. In this configuration, electrolyte stream passes through a very thin channel. CO2 purged from the cathode side diffuses through the GDE and reduction takes place at the interface of electrolyte. The separation of reduction and oxidation products in this setup relies on the diffusion of the gas products instead of membranes. Investigation of ECR within flow-cells are of great importance for ECR scale-up and commercialization, therefore worthy more attention. Additionally, the electrolyte flow provides fresh electrolyte to the electrode surface and might affect the reaction pathways and product selectivity."

The ECR process also involves kinetics, leading to a more negative onset potential than the theoretical reduction potential of CO2. The difference in potential between them is known as the overpotential.\n(2) Current density. It is obtained by dividing the total current by the surface area of the working electrode. Current density reflects the rate of CO2 reaction. (3) Faradaic efficiency (FE), can be calculated by\nεFaradaic ¼ αnFQ :\nwhere α is the number of transferred electrons, n is the number of moles of the target product, F is the Faraday's constant of 96 485 C/mol and Q is the charge passed through in the process. Faradaic efficiency describes the product selectivity in the reduction reaction.\n(4) Tafel slope, derived from the plot of overpotential against logarithm of partial current density, indicates the reaction pathway and rate-determining step."

(9)), which takes place at a potential 1.90 V versus SHE [19]. Therefore, the formation of CO2 ⋅- is regarded as the rate-determining step of CO2 reduction.\nCO2 þ e → CO2 ⋅- (9) CO2 ⋅- radical is highly unstable in aqueous solution and very likely to react with protons.

Aylmer-Kelly et al. identified CO2 ⋅- radical as the intermediate using modulated specular reflectance spectroscopy, during the reduction of CO2 on a lead electrode [21]. Pacansky and coworkers performed computation for CO2 ⋅-, which geometry has a bond angle of 135.3 and the unpaired electron mainly resides on the carbon atom [22]. The subsequent conversion of CO2 ⋅- is complicated and we will discuss different pathways classified by corresponding reaction products."

      "text" : "When CO2 ⋅- radical captures two protons and one electron, HCOOH is produced. The pH values of most electrolytes applied, mostly bicarbonate salt electrolyte, are near-neutral, as a result HCOO is a more common product. One pathway for formate or formic acid formation is that CO2 ⋅- radical binds to the catalyst via carbon atom and reacts with protons or water, as illustrated in Fig. 2a [23]. Electrodes made of p-block metal including In, Sn, Hg, and Pb [24,25] have high selectivity for HCOOH or HCOO . An alternative assumption is that CO2 inserts into the metal-H bond to yield formate (Fig. 2b) [14,23,24]. In this way, CO2 intermediate binds to the metal surface via oxygen atoms, in the form of either monodentate or bidentate. This is supported by computational calculation that H atoms bound to the surface of Pt electrode can reduce CO2 under the catalysis of pyridinium [26]."

If a proton attacks CO2 ⋅- radical via oxygen atom, a carboxyl intermediate *COOH is generated and can further form CO and H2O after subsequent attack of Hþ and e to\nthe oxygen atom of hydroxyl (same as the first three steps in Fig. 3). It is reported that the formation of CO or HCOOH depends on whether carbon or oxygen atoms of CO2 ⋅- radical are attacked by protons. Hori and coworkers compared the products of ECR on different metal electrodes [27], and found that the stability of absorbed CO2 ⋅- radical species on the metal surface influence the selectivity of electrode. That is to say, CO is more likely to form on metal electrodes that CO2 ⋅- radicals are strongly absorbed on, such as Cu, Au, Zn, Pd and Ni. While CO2 ⋅- radicals are weakly or freely absorbed on Pb, Hg, In, Sn, therefore HCOOH/HCOO is the main product."

Nakata et al. used boron-doped diamond electrode for CO2 reduction into HCHO and yield a Faradaic efficiency of 74% in MeOH electrolyte and 62% in NaCl solution, respectively [28]. They proposed that HCHO is from the reduction of HCOOH, which was initially reported by Inoue et al. in a photocatalytic system [29]."

      "text" : "Based on thermodynamics calculation (Eqs. (1)–(8)), multiple-\nelectron reduction of CO2 has a more positive potential. Though it seems alcohols and alkanes are easier to obtain than HCOOH and CO, the processes involved are complicated with many steps and containing both chemical and electrochemical pathways, thus are difficult in terms of kinetics. Only Cu-based electrodes are reported for converting CO2 into C2 or more advanced products [30–32], and the mechanisms are still under debate. Nørskov group simulated and calculated the CH4 pathway, shown in Fig. 3a [33]. CO2 is initially reduced into *CO (1) bound to the Cu surface via carbon atom, then *CO (1) goes through several steps of hydrogenation to generate *CHO (2), *CH2O (3) and *CH3O (4)\nation pathways of ECR [23,24].\nsubsequently. If the next proton takes off the methyl group from *CH3O (4), CH4 is produced. If the proton reacts with the oxygen end of *CH3O (4), CH3OH is produced. Calculations by Nie et al. showed an alternative pathway displayed in Fig. 3b:34 *CO (1) goes through an intermediate *COH (5) and is further reduced to *C (6), following by subsequent hydrogenation into *CH→ *CH2 → *CH3 and eventually CH4. In this route, the activation barrier of *COH (5) is 0.21 eV, which is 0.18 eV lower than that of *CHO (2).\nThe formation mechanisms of ethylene, acetaldehyde and ethanol are even more complex and some determining steps are still unclear. The formation of ethylene may go through either the coupling of CH2 species or combination of CH2 and CO in a FischerTropsch like step, which is also speculated to be the pathway for acetaldehyde and ethanol formation [35]."

      "text" : "As discussed above, various reaction mechanisms for ECR have been proposed and some of them are still the focus of debate. More efforts are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism of ECR and the following are some of the most commonly utilized experimental techniques for mechanism study.\nOnline electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) is an in-situ electrochemical technique combining electrochemistry and mass spectrometry, which enables online analysis of volatile reaction products in\nsolution. The amount of each product varied with electrode potential or time can be monitored. Recently, OLEMS has been exploited in the study of CO2 reduction. For example, Koper group investigated the process of CO2 reduction into methane and ethylene, by identifying the intermediates species and following their consumption with OLEMS [36]. They found that *CHO is the key intermediate, and the breakage of C–O bond leads to the formation of methane. Yet the formation of ethylene goes through a different path that CO dimer forms at the first step, followed by transformation into enediol or enediolate on the metal surface.\nIn-situ electrochemical spectroscopy is another practical method to study interface reactions, and has been applied in the research of ECR. Gold, silver and copper electrodes have been extensive studied because they are SERS-active substrate. It is very sensitive to the CO* and COOH* species. However, for most electrode materials which are not SERSactive, in-situ Raman has to be applied. Compared with SERS, the sensitivity of in-situ Raman is approx. 4–6 order lower than SERS. Rosen et al. [37] applied sum frequency generation spectroscopy apparatus to study the mechanism of improved selectivity to CO in ECR. Cuesta group combined ECR process with surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflection mode (ATR-SEIRAS), and studied the adsorption of CO on Au electrode [38].\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculation is a widely used method in ECR mechanism research, which also provides perspectives for the design of new catalysts. As presented in the discussion of methane and methanol pathways, the mechanisms are proposed based on DFT\ncalculations. In another DFT calculation work of Nørskov group, they established a model showing the relationship between ECR into CO and adsorption energy of key intermediates on metal surfaces [39]. The result indicates a good ECR catalyst needs to stabilize COOH but not CO."

      "heading" : "5.1. Size effect",
      "text" : "The size of nanoparticles (NPs) influences the distribution of atoms on surface, especially corners and edges where sites are considered as more active due to the low coordination number and high surface energy. Therefore, the sizes of metal nanocrystals play an important role in the catalytic performances of ECR, but the optimal size varies with different metals.\nIn the case of Cu NPs, the relationship between catalytic activity and NP size ranging from 1.9 nm to 15 nm was studied by Strasser and coworkers [40]. Bulk Cu and Cu NPs larger than 5 nm exhibit comparable catalytic activities. But when NPs sizes are below 5 nm, their catalytic activities increase significantly with decreasing sizes, and selectivity for hydrocarbon (methane and ethylene) is suppressed. It is further verified by DFT calculations that the improvement of performance and selectivity are attributed to the low-coordinated atoms, which are not only catalytic active but also have stronger chemisorption of CO2, CO and H.\nThe situation for Ag NPs is different from Cu. Masel and coworkers studied the reduction of CO2 to CO in ionic liquids with commercial Ag NPs catalysts, which sizes are 1 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70 nm as well as bulk Ag [41]. The catalytic activity shows a volcano behavior, and the optimal size of Ag NPs for ECR is 5 nm. But the variation of work function with the particle size didn't accord with that of current density (Fig. 4a), so it cannot explain why 1 nm Ag shows decreased catalytic activity. The authors proposed the reason was that intermediates bond more strongly with decreasing particle size, and OH intermediates linger on the metal surface thus inhibiting the reduction of CO2 (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, Kim et al. [42] found that the optimal particle size is also 5 nm for carbon supported Ag in KHCO3 electrolyte. Compared to 3 nm and 10 nm NPs, 5 nm Ag/C has smallest overpotential and highest Faradaic efficiency of\n2015 American Chemical Society.\n84.4% for converting CO2 to CO, as well as highest specific activity before limitation of mass transport (Fig. 4c and d). The DFT results indicate that the use of cysteamine as an anchor agent to prepare Ag/C NPs introduces the Ag–S interaction, which can stabilize *COOH intermediates and reduce overpotential of ECR.\nInvestigation of Au NPs by Kauffman et al. revealed that Au25 clusters can reduce the overpotential of ECR, which is 200mV–300mV smaller than that of 2 nm, 5 nm and bulk Au [43]. Sun group fabricated Au NPs of 4 nm, 6 nm, 8 nm and 10 nm sizes and applied them in the ECR to produce CO [44]. 8 nm Au NPs has the highest FE of 90% at 0.67 V vs. RHE., which is attributed to the optimal population of edge sites that are active in the reduction of CO2 based on DFT calculations.\nThe size effect in Pd NPs in ECR was studied by Gao et al. [45] Carbon supported Pd NPs ranging from 2.4 nm to 10.3 nm were tested. Pd NPs of 2.4 nm and 3.7 nm sizes exhibited FEs all over 80% at different potentials, and 3.7 nm Pd had higher mass activity. DFT calculations indicated that Pd sites on the edges and corners are more active than terrace towards CO2 reduction, but towards HER all three sites are similar."

      "heading" : "5.2. Alloying effect",
      "text" : "Alloys can show enhanced catalytic properties compared to their monometallic counterparts. Factors considered for alloying effect includes but not limited to: d-band center, surface strain and mixing patterns.\nThe d-band center affects the interaction between metal and reaction intermediates [30]. When d-band position is high, the adsorption of intermediates is strong. The d-band center position usually varies with different composition and their ratios [46,47]. The d-band center of Pt atoms in AuPt alloy, for instance, increases with the increasing Au concentration [48]. Yang group fabricated self-assembled Au3Cu, AuCu, AuCu3 nanoalloys, pure Au, and Cu NPs of uniform sizes [49]. They found the d-band center increases with Cu concentration, while pure Au has the most appropriate binding strength to intermediates in the conversion of CO2 to CO according to the experimental CO turnover rates and previous calculations [39] by Nørskov group. Au3Cu, however, presented the peak activity towards CO, which indicated that d-band is\nifferent sizes, showing adsorption and desorption of hydroxide [41]. Copyright ntials and (d) overpotentials at fixed CO partial current densities [42]. Copyright\nnot the sole reason and the arrangement of atoms in alloys also plays a role.\nSurface strains, including compressive and tensile, are mostly caused by the lattice mismatch between shell and sub-surface layers in alloys [50,51], which also affect the adsorption of reactive intermediate [52–54]. Bell and coworkers reported a Cu–Ag bimetallic electrodes with surface alloys that had enhanced selectivity to multi-carbon products over pure copper [55]. They demonstrated that incorporating Ag into Cu causes compressive strain in the Cu atoms, which leads to the shift of valence band structure and decreased oxophilicity of copper, thus altering the adsorptions of intermediate species. Following this strategy, Gewirth group used electrodeposition method to obtain CuAg alloy [56]. Alloy with 6% Ag content showed the best ECR performance, and FE for ethylene and ethanol respectively reaches up to 60% and 25%. Zeng [50] group designed an ideal model based on octahedral and icosahedral Pd to study the tensile strain in ECR. FE for CO of icosahedra Pd catalyst is 1.7-fold higher than that of octahedral Pd. According to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and DFT calculations, tensile strain induces the shift of d-band center and stronger adsorption of key intermediate *COOH. The dependence of catalytic activity on shell thickness for ECR were also studied in various alloy system such as AuPd core-shell nanoparticles [57], Cu overlayers deposited on Pt electrode [58] and so on. The trends vary with different systems. For AuPd alloy, decreased Pd shell thickness results in higher FE of CO2 reduction. The case of Pt-supported Cu overlayers is more complicated. Increased Cu overlayers generated better selectivity to methane, but the relative selectivity for ethylene increased sharply with decreasing Cu thickness.\nOther than approaches of altering intrinsic electronic structure, mixing patterns of metal components in nanoalloys can also affect the catalytic activity in ECR by geometric effect [59]. Ordered, disordered and phase-separated structures are three main mixing patterns as displayed in Fig. 5. Ma et al. [60] prepared different types of CuPd nanoalloys and among them ordered CuPd had the maximum FE of 75% towards CO, whereas phase-separated CuPd and Cu3Pd exhibited higher FE for C2 products ethylene and ethanol. The phase-separated CuPd, however, has the lowest position of d-band center thus weakest binding ability to CO based on surface valence band photoemission spectra. This work indicates that geometric arrangements in Cu–Pd alloy overweigh the electronic structure in terms of determining catalytic selectivity. Yang et al. [61] tested AuCu NPs and found disordered ones are more active towards HER. Ordered AuCu NPs achieve high CO FE of 80%, as well as 3-fold higher turnover and 200mV reduction of overpotential compared to disordered NPs. Phase-blended and phase-separated Ag–Cu2O catalysts were analyzed by Lee group, and the phase-blended sample demonstrated higher ethanol FE due to the favorable distances between Ag and Cu atoms for efficient CO-insertion [62]. Sun group prepared Pd nanocrystals doped by a small amount of Te that bound preferentially at the terrace sites of Pd according to DFT calculation, which significantly increase the CO FE to 90% [63]."

Bao group constructed Au/CeOx interfaces and enhanced ECR activity and selectivity towards CO, as displayed in Fig. 6a–c [68]. They analyzed the CeOx islands on Au(111) under scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and found the interfaces plays a main role for adsorbing and activating CO2 Fig. 6d. Further DFT calculations verified that the formation energy cost of intermediate *COOH on Ce3O7H7/Au (111) interfaces is lower compared\nto that on Au (111), which means reduced Ce sites can stabilize the key reaction intermediates to facilitate the ECR. Sun and coworkers found Pd and CeOx interfaces can reduce overpotential in ECR by stabilizing intermediate *COOH and destablizing *CO [69].\nCu–Cu2O is another example that has been reported for improved ECR performances. Kanan group annealed Cu foil at different temperature in air to obtain Cu2O layers with various thickness, followed by electrochemical reduction [71]. The modified electrode achieved current densities over 1mA/cm2 at overpotentials smaller than 0.4 V, and showed better stability than pure Cu. Kas et al. [72] used electrodeposition method to prepare Cu2O film with different crystalline orientations on Cu plate. The selectivity of ECR depended on the initial thickness of Cu2O film regardless of crystalline orientations. To explain the synergic effect of Cu–Cu2O, Xiao et al. [70] established three models: metallic Cu, oxidized Cu2O and Cu embedded in Cu2Omatrix and conducted quantum mechanics calculations. The free energy barrier for CO2 activation as well as CO dimerization on the Cu-embedded Cu2Omatrix are both the lowest among three models, as shown in Fig. 6e to f, which promotes the formation of C2-products. The fully oxidized Cu2O, however, is unstable during ECR process according to their calculations.\nRecently, interfaces between metal or metal-containing compounds and carbon materials have drawn attention due to their unique performance in ECR. For example, FeOOH supported on nitrogen-doped carbon was examined by Arrigo and coworkers and showed a high acetic acid FE of 97.4% at low applied potential [73]. The high selectivity derived from the synergistic effect at the interfaces between FeOOH and nitrogen-doped carbon, based on both calculations and experimental evidences. Fe species is responsible for the production reactivity of acetic acid and C–C coupling is attributed to the existence of N dopants."

It is reported that bulk defects can stabilize active surfaces of catalysts and generate high-energy surfaces [74].\nGrain boundary is one of the most common defects in polycrystalline nanomaterials, which locates at the joints between different crystalline domains [75]. Kanan group correlated the grain boundaries (GBs) density and ECR activity on flat Au electrodes, and found GB surface terminations are more active than grain ones in converting CO2 into CO but not for competitive HER [74]. They also investigated the quantitative correlation between surface density of GBs on Au NPs and the specific activity for ECR, and a linear relationship was revealed [76]. The Au NPs mentioned above were vapor deposited on carbon nanotubes and the density of GBs can be tuned by annealing at different temperatures. With increasing surface density of GBs, increased specific current density for CO was produced.\nIntroduction of vacancies on metal or metal oxide surface can be another approach to improve ECR performance. For instance, Chen et al. reduced Au oxide films to obtain oxide-derived Au, during which process vacancies and other defects were introduced [77]. The oxide-derived Au needed lower overpotential in the conversion of CO2 into CO compared to polycrystalline Au electrode. Oxygen vacancies in metal oxide result in spare electrons and can act as electron donor, and have been proved to enable CO2 activation [78–80]. Zeng et al. [81] used plasma method and fabricated ZnO nanosheets rich in oxygen vacancies that showed a CO FE of 83%. The oxygen vacancies of ZnO increases the charge density around the valence band maximum, and thus enhance the CO2 activation on account of the abundant electrons transferred to anti-bonding orbitals of CO2 molecules. Xie et al. [82] constructed Co3O4 single unit-cell layers and established the correlation between oxygen vacancy(Vo) concentration and ECR activity. The existence of oxygen vacancies facilitate not only the adsorption of CO2 molecules but also the spontaneous desorption of HCOO . The Vo-rich Co3O4 outperformed the Vo-poor sample in the reduction of CO2 into formate with higher current density, lower\nonset potential and smaller Tafel slope."

[87] carried out DFT computations on N-doped graphene in ECR to find out the potential catalysts. Pyrrolic N was calculated to be the most active with the lowest overpotential and HCOOH would be the exclusive product.\nCatalysts with metals in atomic scale distributed on support are defined as single-atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit enhanced activity on account of the electronic structure and high specific surface area [88]. After Zhang and coworkers’ pioneeringwork of SACs in 2011 [89], lots of efforts have been devoted in this field [90].\nSACs have been applied in ECR and present enhanced performances, and Ni SACs are the most studied. Li et al. reported a Ni SACs supported on N-doped carbon that prepared by an ionic exchange method between Zn and Ni ions in the metal–organic frameworks. The Ni SACs exhibited a higher CO FE of 71.9% at 0.9 V and current density of 10.48mA/cm2 at 1.0 V, which are both 3 times larger compared with Ni nanoparticles on the same support [91]. Xie and coworkers prepared Ni SACs on N-doped C with Ni–N4 sites (Ni–N4–C)by a topo-chemical transformation strategy, as shown in Fig. 7a–c [92]. The Ni–N4–C showed superiority with a CO FE of 99% at 0.81 V and FE above 90% in a wide potential range from 0.5 V to 0.9 V by successfully suppressing HER, d. DFT calculations demonstrate that the formation energy of key intermediate *COOH is lower on Ni–N4 sites than N–C sample without Ni (Fig. 7e and f). Liu et al. [93] reported Ni atoms dispersed on N-doped graphene with a high CO FE of 97% and stability after continuous ECR test for 100 h. The monovalent Ni center of the Ni–N4 structure presents unique electronic configuration and acts as the active site, which was identified by X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy(XANES) and electron paramagnetic resonance(EPR) analysis.\nIn addition to Ni SACs, Fe and Co SACs are effective catalysts for CO2 conversion into CO. For example, Pan et al. [94] developed atomically dispersed M N4 (M¼ Fe or Co) sites derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Fe–N–C sample exhibited larger current density and higher CO FE of 93% than that of Co–N–C (FE 45%). However, Li et al. [95] designed single atom Co–N5 sites which achieve a high CO FE over 90% in a potential range from 0.57 V to 0.88 V. They conducted DFT calculations to reveal the underlying reactivity and the Co–N5 sites are proved to facilitate CO desorption and *COOH intermediate formation.\nDifferent to the OER/HER reactions, ECR is a more complicated process, which typically evolves multiple electron/proton transfer and requires multiple active sites of the intermediate adsorption. Although SACs have shown promising performance for ECR, the pathway how a single atom catalyzes the ECR reaction is still unclear, particularly for some pathways involve multiple sites. Very recently, Xu et al. [90] demonstrated that the carbon atoms around single atom center are activated and behave as catalysts. This might be a possibility to the questions, however, more effort is required to understand the underpinned science.\nSummary and outlook\nWe have summarized the latest research progress in electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in this review. Different reaction pathways are discussed, size and structural effects for the metallic nanoparticles are highlighted and recent advances on single-atom catalysts and doped carbon materials are reviewed. From both experimental and computational points of view, current studies provide various approaches and practical guidelines for catalyst design.\nDespite fruitful advances, we face several challenges and ECR is far from fully understood. More efforts are required for understanding of the fundamental science of ECR. Key intermediates of different pathways vary with catalysts and most of the pathways are not well identified. Although CO production has achieved very high FE, the production of methane and C2 products is still at very early stage. Metal-free materials are low in cost compared to metal catalysts, but the long-term stability needs to be improved.\nUtilization of CO2 demands development of efficient and stable catalysts with high selectivity. Future energy and carbon recycling hinge on the exploration of CO2 transformation. Among current CO2 reduction techniques of intense research such as photocatalytic reduction and\nthermocatalytic reduction, electrocatalytic technology is closest to scale up and commercialization [4]. But for industrial applications of ECR, overpotential, efficiency and stability in electrocatalysis need further improvement. Apparently, a static H-type cell can not meet the requirement for the industrial application due to its restricted current. A flow cell without membrane that provides a large current might be the way. Large-scale production of catalysts is essential for real-world ECR. Exploration of efficient yet low-cost material will still be the focus. Materials with reduced dimensions, for instance, nanosheets and nanowires show special catalytic properties and offer new opportunities. With continuous work, efficient CO2 conversion will be realized when the barriers are overcome.Moreover, we are excited to see if C3 or evenmore complicated products can be achieved selectively when ECR is well mastered in the near future."

In this review we introduce the general methods and metrics that are commonly applied in ECR, followed by a discussion of current reaction mechanisms and different pathways. We highlight how size and structure of electrocatalysts affect ECR performance and review recent advances in metalfree and single-atom catalysts. The challenges of ECR are also discussed and optimistic perspectives are made for",
