With the development of several crafts, many types of pollutants were abandoned in the environment [1–5]. Organic compound dyes considered as chemical contaminants are deeply venomous and a menace to human health. Hence, eliminating them from water is significant. Hitherward, several methods have been applied to decompose this type of contaminant, such as filtration, Fenton process, ozone reaction, adsorption, etc. Recently, applying of semiconductors nano-powders as a nano-\nphotocatalyst to obviate energy and environmental acmes have possessed an excellent deal of attention due to the free and unique usage of the light energy to decompose contaminants [6–20]. Among the semiconductors, TiO2, SnS2 and ZnO have been investigated widely due to its low cost, non-toxic and chemical and optical stability. Despite, this catalyst due to its excellent energy band gap, can only weak work in the light irradiation [21–25]. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) has significant attention due to high chemical stability, low costs, nil toxicity and effective as photocatalysts.

From Fig. 1A, the morphological of prepared SiO2 samples are spheres with the high size of particles. The SEM image of MnS2-SiO2 nanocomposites demonstrates the agglomerated nanoparticles, which confirms the MnS2 nanoparticles coated on SiO2 nanoparticles surfaces (Fig. 1B). The Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) was analyzed for evaluation the presence of all elements in the MnS2-SiO2 nanocomposites framework. EDS analysis shows the Silicon (Si, 32%), Manganese (Mn, 32%), Oxygen (O, 17%), and sulfur (S, 19%). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a study in physics that can be used to specify the size values of nanoparticles. The DLS curve of the SiO2 and MnSi-1 are revealed in Fig. 1C. The particle size of the SiO2, and MnSi-1 nanocomposites were 100.0, and 65.0 nm, respectively. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2 shows the crystalline phases of the SiO2, and MnSi-1 nanocomposites, respectively. As can be seen, the diffraction curve of SiO2 indicates the amorphous crystallinity (Fig. 2A) [21]. The MnSi-1 nanocomposites has four distinct diffraction peaks, at 2θ of 30.5°, 34.8°, 42.9°, 54.0°, 55.9°, and 63.0° are ascribed to the (210), (211), (220), and (221) planes, which that shows the crystalline phases of cubic structure of MnS2 (JCPDS card No. 25–0549) [55]. The crystallite size [55] was distinguished to be 52.21 nm for MnSi-1 nanocomposites.\nIn order to further specify the chemical states of elements in the MnSi-1 nanocomposites, their XPS spectra were indicated in Fig. 3. In the status of the Si 2p spectrum (Fig. 4a), the peak at 106.6 eV binding energy well shows Si 2p1/2, and the peaks of Si 2p3/2 identified at 102.2 eV binding energies are corresponding to a spin-orbit splitting specification, respectively [56]. The peaks of Mn 2p clear at a binding energy of 640.2 (Mn 2p3/2) and 652.9 eV (Mn 2p1/2), demonstrating Mn state exists in the MnSi-1 nanocomposites [45]. The O 1 s peaks at 530.41 eV, are certain to lattice oxygen-binding SieO and the water molecules surface hydroxyl group [56]. The S 2p peak appears at 161.4 eV and reports binding energies of Sulfur in MnS2 [45].\nFor the comparative investigation, the optical properties of SiO2, MnSi-0, MnSi-1, and MnSi-2 are shown in Fig. 4. Spectra in Fig. 4A indicates that the pure SiO2 possess UV–vis absorption spectra, while\nthat of the MnS2-SiO2 nanocomposites has strong UV region spectra. With enhances doping MnS2, the absorption intensity of composite was increased due to charge transfer transition was enhanced [57,58].

Combinations of different levels of pH\nand reaction time were analyzed to study the performance of the photocatalyst on dye removal. The Dye adsorption was carried out in a dark medium by SiO2, MnSi-0, MnSi-1, and MnSi-2 nanocomposites in 30min to achieve the adsorption-desorption balance. The results showed, among of prepared samples, the MnSi-2 nanocomposites have significant adsorption of dye about 17.5%, due to the catalyst structure and surface area modified for the removal capacity.\nThe photocatalytic capacity of SiO2, MnSi-0, MnSi-1, and MnSi-2 nanocomposites was done by using MB molecule. From Fig. 5A, the photocatalytic degradation values of methylene blue over SiO2, MnSi-0, MnSi-1, and MnSi-2 nanocomposites are about 53.1, 63.1, 83.1, and 96.1% within the 60min under UV light illumination, respectively. This enhanced photo-degradation performance of MnSi-2 nanocomposites is generally due to the forming of p-n nanoheterojunction structural\nwhich modifies the separation of the e−/h+ pairs and decrease the recombination of the e−/h+ pairs excited, and the low band gap of MnSi-2 was found from UV–vis DRS [59–61].\nTo identify the influence of pH solution on the photo-degradation of methylene blue over SiO2, MnSi-0, MnSi-1, and MnSi-2 nanocomposites, experiments were done at the pH=5, 7 and 9 that are indicated in Fig. 5B. As can be obvious, the photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples were high values in basic region. Therefore, the pH influence can be described using pHpzc. The charge zero points of SiO2, and MnS2–SiO2 were determined to be about 4.0, and 6.7, respectively. At pH solution values higher than pHpzc; the surface charge of prepared nano-photocatalyst is negative due to the absorption of OH−. Moreover, methylene blue is a cationic surface charge dye. Herewith, the formation of the electrostatic force between the negative surface charges of the nano-catalyst and the MB positive surface charge, makes the great photo-degradation of MB from water [62]."

Prepared nano-catalyst were investigated in the photo-degradation of methylene blue under UV light illumination. Structural and optical attributes of as-prepared nano-catalysts were evaluated by X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphological were studied by scanning electron microscopy-EDS, and dynamic light scattering. The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was applied to examine the band gap energy. The Eg values of SiO2, MnS2-SiO2–0, MnS2-SiO2–1, and MnS2-SiO2–2 nanocomposites are 6.51, 3.85, 3.17, and 2.67 eV, respectively. The particle size of the SiO2 and MnS2-SiO2–1 nanocomposites were 100.0, and 65.0 nm, respectively. The crystallite size values of MnS2-SiO2–1 were 52.21 nm, and 2.9 eV, respectively. MnS2-SiO2 nano-photocatalyst was recognized as the optimum sample by degrading 96.1% of methylene blue from water. Moreover, the influence of pH of the solution, and contact time as decisive factors on the photo-degradation activity were investigated in this project. The optimum data for pH and time were found 9 and 60min, respectively. The photo-degradation capacity of MnS2-SiO2–2 is improved (96.1%) due to the low band gap was found from UV–vis DRS. The antimicrobial data of MnS2-SiO2 were studied and demonstrated that the MnS2SiO2 has fungicidal and bactericidal attributes.",
