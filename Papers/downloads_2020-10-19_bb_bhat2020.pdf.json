      "text" : "Capacitors and supercapacitors have gained a lot of interest in recent times. They differ from batteries, the way in which they store charges. Unlike the batteries, capacitors do not suffer from cyclability issues, as they store energy electrostatically [1]. Due to the relatively low specific energy density, conventional capacitors are not so popular although they have a fast static electric charge. Recently, supercapacitors or electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) have attracted a lot of attention due to their relatively higher specific energy density and equivalent power densities compared to capacitors [2]. Supercapacitors can be also be tuned to the requirement of the applications just like batteries [3]. Supercapacitors exhibit a fast chargedischarge process with millions of cycles before the deterioration of active material sets in [3,4]. For this to happen, electrolytes involved, need to have faster access to the entire electrode surface. High surface area and porous structure contribute towards higher specific capacitance [5].\nCommercially, porous carbons are produced by petroleum residues as precursors with templates or without templates. Siliceous sources, zeolites, clays, and other inorganic sources have been used as templates [5–9]. Obtaining porous carbons with structural periodicity is hard with a decrease in pore diameters in templates along with the method being economically nonviable [7]. Compared to template-based techniques, the non-templated route offers low-cost, one-step production of hierarchical porous carbons with equivalent topological structures to those produced from template-based methods [10].\nCarbon forms, synthesized from carbonization of agricultural waste biomass, as the active electrode material, have gained significant interest in recent times for supercapacitor applications as they have the inherently high surface area and hierarchical porosity, a tailor-made requirement for efficient energy storage devices [5,11–18]. Lignocellulosic materials found richly in biomass, are inexpensive and effective as precursors for synthesizing porous carbons; which could also be used for free-standing electrode materials [19–21]. There are different activation methods though available, the non-activation\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2020.101829 Received 28 April 2020; Received in revised form 30 July 2020; Accepted 19 August 2020\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Among all agriculture wastes, Allium sativum (Garlic) peel is one of the promising materials as a lignocellulosic precursor for synthesizing porous carbons. Because of its culinary and medicinal traits, it is widely used around the world. The garlic production currently is estimated to be ~25 megatonnes with ~2.3 pounds per person [23]. Naturally, a large amount of garlic peel is expected to be discarded as waste. Garlic peel has already been used for fruits and vegetable coatings [24] and extraction of antioxidants [25]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one report on using garlic peel precursor for porous carbon synthesis which used chemical activation method to study electrochemical behaviour [10]. Herein, we have synthesized porous nano carbon from garlic peels employing a non-templating technique (without any activation method). The effect of pyrolysis temperature on specific surface area and pore volume was studied and the formation and evolution of spherical morphology were elucidated. A detailed investigation of the electrochemical properties of porous nano carbon was carried out. The electrochemical nature of the porous nano carbon depends on choices of carbon precursors and synthesis conditions as specific surface area and presence of surface functional groups can affect double-layer capacitances. The surface heteroatom-containing groups such as oxygen or nitrogen play a crucial role in enhancing capacitance performances with improved wettability between electrode and electrolyte [26]. The as-prepared nanoparticles showed abundant oxygen-containing functional groups that are conducive for electrodes and electrolyte interaction. A detailed investigation of the electrochemical properties of porous nano carbon was carried out. It is worth noting that the large underutilized garlic peels can be converted into porous carbon nano materials as electrodes for supercapacitors."

The dried skin of garlic was ground to a fine powder and was sieved (Vibratory sieve shaker, Aimil) to obtain a uniform particle size of 60µm. The sieved powder was pyrolyzed under nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate of 150 mL cm−3) at different temperatures, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000° C, from here on words will be named as GCNS4, GCNS5, GCNS6, GCNS7, GCNS8, GCNS9, and GCNS10, respectively in a quartz tube furnace (Nopo Nanotechnologies, TZ4L Temperature controller, India) at a heating rate of 10 °C per minute, followed by an isothermal plateau of 1 h at respective temperatures with a cooling rate of 2 ᴼC/min. As biomass pyrolysis is increasingly becoming a promising technology for synthesizing novel carbonaceous structures for electrochemical applications, the need of mechanistic understanding of decomposition pathways has been attempted, which are still elusive [27]. A detailed study on the synthesis of porous nano carbon materials and the role of temperatures is reported in our previous works [28–30]. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the synthesis process."

The shape of the porous nano carbon obtained after pyrolysis was understood by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (JEOL JSM-7100F) at 15kV. The elemental composition of synthesized porous nano carbon was found using Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS). Topographical and morphological features were established from High-Resolution Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) using TALOS F200S G2 instrument. The X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was done (PANanalyticalX-Ray) from 10 °C to 80 °C to phase identifications and to know the unit cell dimensions. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) was recorded (FTIR, Perkin-Elmer, spectrum 100) from 4000 to 400 cm−1 to ascertain the groups present and for knowing the purity of the compounds. To understand the degree of crystallization, The Raman spectra were acquired using HORIBA Scientific with an excitation laser of 532 nm wavelength using a 50× objective. The laser power was 0.25 mW and the acquisition time was 60 s. Further, the surface properties, such as surface area, pore size, the pore volume of the CNSs were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and tplot using N2 adsorption-desorption technique (BELSORP-max, Microtrac, Japan)."

Saturated calomel electrode was used as a reference electrode and Platinum wire was employed as a counter electrode. All the electrochemical studies of the three-electrode system were done in 4.0 M KOH electrolyte. Out of different electrolyte concentrations (KOH), only 4.0 M KOH exhibited appreciable values. Hence the electrochemical studies were performed in 4.0 M KOH. The experiments were done in AUTOLAB M204 fitted with a frequency response analyzer (FRA). Cyclic voltammetry experiments for the threeelectrode system were conducted in the potential window of -1V to 0 V at different scan rates ranging from 10mV/s to 100 mV/s. Constant current charge-discharge tests were conducted at varying current densities from 0.1 A/g to 1.0 A/g. The impedance of the system was analyzed from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, at 10mV with AC amplitude signal at open circuit potential (OCP). A practical symmetrical supercapacitor was constructed using GCNS10 coated on both the electrodes isolating them from each other by a porous Whatman® glass microfiber filter membrane which was soaked in 4.0 M KOH electrolyte solution before use. The total mass loading onto both the electrodes was found to be ~3 mg. This was sandwiched and pressed (at 1000 psi) into a coin cell (CR2032). Electrochemical studies were carried out similarly to the three-electrode setup."

      "text" : "TGA was done to understand the thermal behavior of garlic peel precursors shown in Fig. S1, depicting three-stage weight loss as the temperature was increased from 30 °C to 995 °C at the rate of 5 °C min−1. The weight loss at the first stage, below 200°C, was found to be around ~15%, is due to the removal of water content from the cellular structure of garlic peels [31]. The wider second stage from 200-750°C indicated the largest weight loss of ~74%, which can be attributed to the decomposition of carbohydrates, cellulose, and hemicellulose components of garlic peel [20]. Lignin residues generally decompose at higher temperatures than cellulose and hemicellulose residues [19]. The mass remaining after the second stage is majorly due to lignin decomposes, carbonaceous structures, and inorganic impurities [32]. Beyond 750°C, there is very minimal weight loss. The primary purpose\nof carbonization was to enrich carbon content by the removal of volatile compounds. This results in the rearrangement of carbon atoms into the graphitic-like structure. From the TGA plot, it can be expected that, with the increase in pyrolysis temperature, the carbon percentage in the residue also increases which was also confirmed by EDS."

      "text" : "The FESEM image of powdered raw garlic peels is shown in Fig S2a. Fig. 2a, shows the FESEM morphology of GCNS10. FESEM images of all the synthesized nanoparticles are shown in Fig S2.\nAs can be seen from Fig S2 and Fig. 2a-d, well defined spherical structures start to form at elevated temperatures. The pie chart (Fig. 2b) is constructed using Fig. 2a, which shows the particle size distribution in GCNS10. The majority of the particles lie with a diameter in the range of 50-75 nm. Some of these smaller sized particles get aggregated and form clusters with a size of more than 100 nm. Fig. 2c and d, show the TEM images that further confirm the spherical form of synthesized porous nano carbon. It can be seen from FE-SEM and TEM images that the obtained nanomaterials are in the form of tufts knotted together and intertwined to follow the curvature of a sphere. It is believed that the presence of calcium would aid in forming interconnections between pores [33].\nFrom Fig S3, it is clear that, as the pyrolysis temperature was increased, residue richer in carbon content and reduced oxygen content was obtained. EDS plot showing the elemental composition of GCNS10 is shown in Fig. 2e and the EDS plot of all the synthesized GCNSs is shown in Fig S4. Garlic peel, the precursor with 60.2 % carbon was pyrolyzed and converted to GCNSs, with GCNS4 having 74% C and GCNS10 having the highest carbon content of 82.8%. The nanomaterials were also found to be rich in oxygen, with 22.6% for the GCNS4 and 16.6% for GCNS10. Table S1 lists the elemental compositions of the precursor sample and synthesized GCNSs.\nFTIR results exhibited in Fig. 2f, for GCNS10 further confirmed the purity of the sample and the presence of functional groups. FTIR spectra of other GCNSs can be found in Fig S5. Peak present at 3448 cm−1 ascribed to ‒O‒H stretching vibrations, peak at 2921 cm−1 can be ascribed to ‒C‒H stretching vibrations. The shoulder peak at 1633 cm−1 can be assigned to stretching vibrations of ‒C=C‒ with decreasing intensity from GCNS4 to GCNS10. Bending vibrations ‒C‒H and ‒C=C‒ were observed at 1416 cm−1 and 873 cm−1 respectively. A peak at 1067 cm−1 could be assigned to ‒C‒O stretching [34]."

      "text" : "Particle arrangement in GCNS10 was analyzed by XRD. The formation of turbostratic carbons is indicated by XRD patterns [35]. Peak positions for GCNS10 (Fig. 2g) at 2θ = ~29° and at ~47° correspond to 002 and 100 planes of graphitized carbon respectively [30]. This reveals the infusion of some graphitic short-range order into GCNSs. As the temperature is increased from 400 to 1000°C the intensity of a sharp peak at ~29° increases. Fig S6 shows the XRD patterns obtained for other GCNSs. Higher intensity at lower angles suggests the presence of a high magnitude of micropores in GCNSs [36]. XRD of the raw precursor is shown in Fig S7. Minor peaks of CaO and CaCO3 are observed which are present along with pyrolyzed carbon as metals like Ca are also present in biomass precursor [37].\nThe Raman spectrum of GCNS10 (Fig. 2h) exhibits the D band and G band indicating defects and disorders in graphitic structures. A peak at 1357 cm−1 (D-band) is attributed to disordered and structural defects arising from the sp3- hybridized carbon because of A1g mode of vibration [29]. The peak at 1598 cm−1 (G-band) can be attributed to E2g mode of vibration from the stretching of the C=C bond in graphitic materials with sp2 carbon systems. The amorphous degree can be expressed as the peak ratio of the D-band to the G-band. This ID/IG ratio is also an indication of defect sites in the GCNSs. All the other synthesized GCNSs also exhibited similar patterns with lesser ID/IG ratio than GCNS10, which are shown in Fig S8. ID/IG ratios are tabulated in Table 1. As the synthesis temperature is increased from 400°C to 1000°C, the ID/IG ratio also increases from 0.8 for GCNS4 and 1.03 for GCNS10 indicating increased surface defects in GCNS10, which has been proven beneficial for supercapacitor applications as discussed in coming sections."

An asymmetric tailing, partially due to intrinsic asymmetry in graphite peak was observed at C1s region. Curve fitting was optimized through C1s decomposition into four peaks corresponding to graphitic like carbon (284.59 eV), C-O (285.8 eV), C=O (287.07 eV), -COOH (289.86 eV) [38]. The presence of C=C peak at 284.45 eV, indicates the temperature-based conversion of phytocomponents of garlic into a graphitic structure. The curves fitted centered on 285.2, 286.6, 289.4 eV indicates the presence of hydroxyl, ether and ketone group's inherited bonding in the graphitic planes. This\nfunctionalization can be attributed to the presence of several bioactive components in garlic [39]."

      "heading" : "3.5. Porosity",
      "text" : "The surface area of GCNSs was obtained from the N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm experiment carried out at 77 K. Fig S9 shows the N2 sorption isotherms, which are archetypal of materials having hierarchical pore structures. Most of the GCNSs exhibited Type IV sorption isotherm with a typical hysteresis loop common for porous carbon structures with a slight exception for GCNS4 and GCNS5. A large rise in\nthe amount of N2 adsorbed at low relative pressure (p/po < 0.2) indicate the existence of micropores. Hysteresis loop at 0.2 < p/po < 1.0 indicate presence of mesopores [40,41]. The specific surface area for GCNS4 was found to be 8.1 m2/g whilst it was found to be 436.2 m2/g for GCNS10 which is significantly higher, clearly demonstrates the effect of synthesis temperature on the surface area of GCNSs (Fig. 2j). The experimental observations are tabulated in Table 1. Barrett-JoynerHalenda (BJH) method, based on capillary condensation, is often employed along with the t-plot method to characterize mesopores and micropores, respectively (Fig. 2l and S9h). With an increase in pyrolysis temperature, the mean pore diameter has decreased from 15.7 nm for\nGCNS4 to 2.3 nm for GCNS10 (Fig. 2k). The pore volume measured at p/p° =0.94 increased significantly with an increase in pyrolysis temperatures for GCNSs (Fig. 2k). For GCNS4 pore volume was 0.027 cm3/ g while for GCNS10 it was found to be 0.26 cm3/g (Table 1) of which micropores contribute significantly (0.22 cm3/g). The same trend is observed at elevated temperatures which is significant as it confirms the formation of a large number of smaller pores at elevated temperatures contributing to the increase in surface area. Conversely, at lower temperatures, there is only a small number of larger pores. Such hierarchical coexistence of both mesopores and micropores in GCNSs at elevated temperatures makes them suitable for supercapacitor applications using non bulkier aqueous electrolytes such as KOH."

      "text" : "Cyclic voltammetric curves (CV) of all the GCNSs electrode materials in a three-electrode setup using 4.0 M KOH as the electrolyte are shown in Fig. 3. All exhibited quasi-rectangular shapes, which are typical of an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The electrodes were operated at negative potential 1.0 V. Scan rate was varied from 10 mVs−1 to 100 mVs−1 and plots were characterized by the absence of any redox peaks, stereotypical of an EDLC behavior.\nThe constant current galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of the three-electrode system in 4.0 M KOH are depicted in Fig. 4. The plots are triangular and symmetric which indicates the rapid electrolyte diffusion mechanism leading to a faster I-V response. Specific capacitance for the three-electrode system was calculated using the following Eq. (1) [42].\n=C I x t V x msp (1)\nwhere I is the discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), ΔV is the potential window (V) and m is the mass of the GCNS active material loaded onto the electrode. As can be seen in Fig. 4i, specific capacitance decreases with an increase in current density. At higher current densities, ions in the electrolyte, will not have sufficient time for diffusion into inner pores, resulting in lowering of capacitance. GCNS10 with more pore volume showed specific capacitance of 174 F/g and GCNS4 with lowest surface area and lower pore volume exhibited specific capacitance of 96.1 F/g at 0.1 A/g. Low capacitance can also be attributed to oxygen heteroatom, which is an electron-drawing group. Excessive O doping (>22% in Table S1), will reduce the conductivity of the carbon material, resulting in poor rate performance. However, the high-level O dopant also has a positive effect on the capacitance through enhancing the surface wettability of carbon materials, which benefits fast ion transportation into the inner pore channels and achieves satisfactory surface accessibility for electrolyte ions, boosting the electric doublelayer capacitance [26,43].\nFurthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), was used to understand the ion and electron transport behavior of GCNSs under open circuit potential [44]. Fig. 5a, shows the Nyquist impedance plots measured at a frequency range of 0.01 to 105 Hz. The plot depicts the typical features of porous carbon electrodes, with a 45° Warburg\nregion at a lower frequency and a small semicircle in the high-frequency region. The length of the 45° region is related to the diffusion resistance or Warburg impedance caused by the ion diffusion from the bulk of electrolyte into the electrode interface [45]. The intercept on the X-axis indicated by RS which represents the combined resistance of the ions in an electrolyte, intrinsic resistance of the active electrode material, and contact resistance with the current collector. RS value in the range of 1.1-0.3 Ω was obtained, with 1.1 Ω for GCNS5 and 0.3 Ω for GCNS10 indicating a very low resistance and good ion response at high-frequency region (Impedance values of GCNS4 not shown here). The charge transfer resistance (RCT) [46], also shows a significant decrease from 24.6 Ω for GCNS5 to 3.3 Ω for GCNS10 signifying the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the electrochemical behavior of the GCNSs. Key parameters obtained after fitting with the data are tabulated in Table 2. Capacitance is also derived from impedance spectroscopy as shown in Eq. (2) and (3) [47].\n=C Z Z 2 (2)\n=C Z Z 2 (3)\nwhere = +Z Z Z[( ) ( ) ]2 2 1/2 is the complex impedance, ω= 2πf, f is the frequency at which the phase angle reaches -45° or the lowest applied frequency, Z′ is the real part and Z″ is the imaginary part of the complex impedance. C′ and C″ are the real and imaginary capacitances respectively. C′, often calculated at the lowest applied frequency attributes to the energy stored in supercapacitors [47].\nDouble layer charge storage and absence of faradic charge storage are indicated by the Bode plot (Fig. 5b) wherein phase shift being 90° at the low-frequency region. Dependence of phase angle on frequency is shown in Fig. 5b. A characteristic frequency at which phase angle reaches 45° is called knee frequency, where capacitive and resistive impedances are equal. After this point, at higher frequencies, supercapacitors show resistive nature [48]. From the Bode plot, it is clear that GCNS10 in 4.0 M KOH, with phase angle -78.8° is quite comparable to an ideal capacitor (-90°) [29]. The time constant (τ) is an indicator of the responsiveness of the supercapacitors. It was calculated from preformulated equations [49]. Obtained values are tabulated in Table 2. Since GCNS4, due to only partial carbonization, exhibited very high impedance when compared with other GCNSs, the corresponding Nyquist plot is provided in Fig S10, for the same. Balancing the oxygen content and the graphitization degree would help ensure the optimal dynamics performance between the electrode and electrolyte."

(From here onwards referred to as GCNS10C). Fig. 6a, shows the CV plot of GCNS10C with a potential window of 1.0 V. The CV curves show a quasi-rectangular shape at lower scan rates. No oxidation-reduction peak was observed, indicating the capacitive behavior of the fabricated device. The absence of any characteristic redox peaks while the potential window was increased from 1.0 V to 1.4 V (Fig. 6b), indicates capacitive behavior and signifies the capability of GCNS10C for operating at higher potential windows. Charge discharge curves at different current densities from 0.1 A/g to 5.0 A/g under different potential windows (Fig. 6c) displayed triangular, linear symmetrical nature with bare minimum iR drop, confirming the EDLC behavior and good electrochemical reversibility of GCNS10C. The fabricated supercapacitor cell had a Csp of 119.9, 115.7, and 105.1 F/g of at 1.4, 1.2, and 1.0 V operating potential at 0.1 A/g, respectively. The capacitances are lower than that obtained for GCNS10 in three electrodes set up (174 F/g). In the three-electrode setup, a complete potential window is applied on the working electrode wherein\nfor symmetrical supercapacitor device/cell, the applied potential is shared between the two electrodes [50].\nAnother key performance indicator, Specific energy density, and specific power density of the carbon nanosphere, GCNS10 supercapacitor cell were calculated using the following Eqs. (4) and (5) [36]:\n=E Wh kg C x V 7.2 sp 2\n(4)\n=P W kg E x 3600 t (5)\nwhere, Csp (F/g) is the specific capacitance calculated from chargedischarge cycles, ΔV (V) is the potential window, and t (s) is the discharge time during the galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. Based on the galvanostatic charge-discharge curves of GCNS10C, at 1.4 V, the specific energy at various specific power is calculated to be 32.6 Whkg−1 at specific power of 108 Wkg−1 respectively. The specific energy density and specific power density being inversely related, as specific power increases, specific energy decreases. Ragone plot depicting the variation of specific energy with specific power at different potential window is plotted in Fig. 8a. Table 3, lists the specific energy and specific power values for the device, calculated at different operating potentials.\nThe energy performances of GCNS10C is superior to some of the previously published works based on carbons derived from biomass [51–55]. Table 4, exhibits a performance comparison of this work with previously published works. As can be seen from some of the published works in Table 4, despite having larger capacitances reported than this work (GCNS10C), they lack in the key parameter of specific energy density when compared with GCNS10 symmetric supercapacitor.\nThe Nyquist impedance plot with low RS value of 1.1 Ω with high electrical conductivity is exhibited by the device as suggested by the EIS results Fig. 7a). Ionic diffusion is represented by a vertical line at lower frequencies characterized by Warburg impedance at -45° phase angle. The Bode plot (Fig. 7b) shows the phase angle of -75.1° which is close to the ideal capacitor phase angle (-90°). Most importantly, the time constant (τ) calculated was found to be 1.6 s which is very much lesser than some of the earlier reported works including asymmetric supercapacitors [46,61,62]. The correlation between capacitance and frequency indicates the complex model of capacitance as shown in Fig. 7c. The real and imaginary parts of the capacitances were calculated from Eqs. (2) and ((3) respectively. The equivalent RC circuit for the device is shown in Fig S11.\nThe cycling stability is a quintessential factor for supercapacitor electrodes. To affirm GCNS10C for use in practical supercapacitors, stability studies were made using galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling at a current density of 1.0 A/g for 25,000 cycles as shown in\nFig. 8b-c. The GCNS10C exhibited excellent capacitance retention with more than 93% retention at 10,000th cycle and 76.5 % by the end of 25,000th charge/discharge cycling indicating very good cycling ability. GCNS10C also exhibited seamless coulombic efficiency of 97.8 % even after 25,000 cycles owing to the porous nature of GCNS10 facilitating effective accessibility of electrolyte ions, demonstrating excellent cycle stability and efficiency.\nThe electrochemical performance of the device after 25,000 chargedischarge cycles showed minimal devaluation signifying excellent tenacity of GCNS10. The magnitude of attenuation of the I-V response is depicted by the CV plot in Fig. 9a, before and after stability studies, which shows a minimal decrease of current in response to the applied potential. The RS value is increased from 1.1 to 1.4 Ω as shown in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 9b and Table 2). The Bode plot represented in Fig. 9c,\ndepicts the phase angle of -71.2°, a marginal decrease from the earlier phase angle of -75.5°.\nTo see the morphological changes of the material after 25,000 cycles, the device was decrimped and the SEM image of the material is taken and is shown in Fig S12. It suggests that material is stable even after 25,000 cycles and minimal noticeable difference in morphology is observed. Fine-tuning in terms of functionalizing the GCNSs along with different activating agents might enhance the performance of energy storage devices. More studies concerning these parameters are in progress and will be reported elsewhere."

      "text" : "An oxygen self-doped porous carbon electrode is prepared through a green and low-cost waste to wealth carbonization method without adding any catalysts. Porous nano carbon with large surface area (436.2\na Impedance measurement taken before starting 25,000 charge discharge cycles.\nb Impedance measurements recorded after the end of 25,000 charge discharge cycles.\nm2/g) was synthesized from agriculture waste peels at different temperatures were experimented as active electrode material for an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). Pyrolysis temperature significantly affected the nature and electrochemical properties. GCNS10,\nsynthesized at 1000°C exhibited higher surface area with hierarchical porous structures, contributed to higher specific capacitance. The symmetric device, CR2032 coin cell, fabricated exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 119.2 F/g at 0.1 A/g under 1.4V with a specific\nenergy of 32.6 Wh/kg. The device displayed excellent stability for 25,000 galvanostatic constant current charge-discharge cycles, retaining coulombic efficiency of 97.8%. The device exhibited 93.65% capacity retention at the 10,000th cycle, eventually decreased to 76.57% at the end of the 25,000th cycle. The present work demonstrated the utilization of waste biomass as a precursor for conversion into facile electrochemical energy storage devices by an economically viable one-step process without the use of any templates and catalysts. However specific capacitance will need to be improved upon lowering of impedance by functionalizing and activation of the materials. GCNS10C supercapacitor based on garlic peels can be used in hybrid energy storage systems with cell stacks.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nVinay S.

Porous nature was determined from N2 sorption experiments. The electrochemical studies were done in three and two electrode setups. The maximum specific capacitance obtained was 174 F/g at 0.1 A/g in 4.0 M KOH electrolyte. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 119.2 F/g at 0.1 A/g and a specific energy of 32.6 Wh/kg. The device exhibited impeccable stability for 25,000 charge-discharge cycles, with 97.8% coulombic efficiency. Capacitance retention of 93% was observed even at the end of 10000th cycles, suggesting the huge capacity of biomass-derived non-activated carbon nanomaterials for efficient, stable high-performance electrodes in electrochemical energy storage ap-",
