A novel hybrid material of pristine PPTA/MWNTs nano-composite was designed to produce uniform nanofibers with diameters range over 17–29 nm for electercal conductivity application. A series of PPTA based nano-composite materials were prepared using an ultrasonic bath with various ratios of pristine multi-wall carbon nanotubes and COOH- Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). The dispersion of multi-wall carbon nanotubes has been inspected by several analyses, Raman’s spectroscopy, which indicated the presence of different peaks characteristic.

      "text" : "In the last few decades, carbon-based materials have an elicited extensive interest as promising materials for various sectors of our daily life, including catalysis, energy, environment and biology [1–5]. Poly aramids materials are highly regarded as one of the commercial significance polymers. The poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) is an aromatic polyamide which has commercially known as Kevlar [1,6]. The PPTA is considered as one of the liquid-crystal polymer, and it has brilliant performances in tensile properties, strength and modulus, thermal and dimensional stability. Therefore, it has been broadly applied in composite reinforcement, including aviation and aerospace, ropes and cables, military, automobile, ballistic fabrics, and asbestos replacement [6–12]. Generally, The PPTA can be produced through the poly-condensation process of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and terephthalic acid (TPA) and this process providing open face and well organized molecules [13]. Kevlar-49 was systematically prepared from\nPET waste bottles with unique properties similar to a commercial product [14]. The PPTA is strongly connected according to hydrogen bonding as well as amide coupling nature and usually insoluble in organic solvents. On the contrary, the PPTA is soluble in strong acidic solutions and makes in the shape of lyotropic mesophase to exhibit extreme mechanical and thermal stabilities. Therefore, many efforts for modification were done through copolymerization [15,16]. Burch et al., [17] reported that PPTA as an example of aromatic polyamides are able to connect with diversity of basic solutions such as dimethyl sulfoxide for producing polyanion phase. In addition, similar technique was applied to synthesis functionalized nano-aramid structures [18]. Moreover, the mixture of two ultra-strong materials was accumulated to produce a symbiotic effect for supporting several of polymeric substances. The 2 and 5wt% silicate nanotubes of the mineral halloysite was mixed with polyamide-6 (PA 6) for reinforcement through melt extrusion and an adjacent injection molding process [19].\nNanomaterials are gaining considerable attention over the last\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2019.103002 Received 20 January 2019; Received in revised form 21 February 2019; Accepted 2 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Regarding the amazing physical and electrical properties of different carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [26], they are assumed to be the vital reinforcing and effective conducting filler for polymers [27,28]. As is known, CNTs have an even distribution of the charge on the surface and therefore, there is difficulty in achieving any interaction on the surface. The interfacial binding is considered as the principle necessity to progress on loading and modification of the CNT with polymer matrix. Chemical modification is one of the methods used to enhance interfacial binding of CNT, and in the absence of this modification, the CNT adjustment depends on van der Waals forces. Many reports have shown remarkable progress in hybrid materials nanocomposite due to their extreme advantages and applications that far exceed traditional materials and methods. Both SWCNTs and MWCNTs have exhibited the smooth inner surfaces which could offer an ideal method for improvement. The CNTs presented mechanical strengthening with diversity of polymers such as PVA [29], epoxy, PMMA, and polyamide [30–32]. A considerable improvement in the mechanical properties of Kevlar fibers was achieved by incorporating CNTs [33]. The improvements of the composites electrical properties are depending on the preparation method, polymer matrix, and the dispersion of the CNTs [34,35]. Moreover, the percolation verge differs according to the existing ratio; therefore, the apparent physical property variations and high ratio adjustment are required. Based on this accurate percolation verge of CNTs are variable even though the electrical percolation verge is around 0.1–3.0 wt % of CNTs [36–38]. Take into account, both of CNTs and PPTA as aramid nanostructures are 1D nanostructured materials as well as the specific high pore volumes, π–π interactions and van der Waals’s forces are predictable and forming stronger interfacial interaction [39–43]. In this context, PPTA is utilized in polymeric composite materials as a novel shape in nano-scale nature with desirable highly mechanical and electrical conductive materials [44]. Aramid nanofibers coated MWNTs were synthesized and used as additives to for the reinforcement of polymers [45,46].\nIn the current work, a novel hybrid material of pristine MWNTs and poly (p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) was designed through the functionalization of MWNTs using PPTA to produce nanotubes surface functionalized with repeat units of the PPTA (Scheme 1). The results confirmed the dispersions of uniform nanofibers of the hybrid materials with diameters range over 17˜29 nm were successfully achieved. The consequence of MWCNTs through the thermal and electrical conductivity was evaluated. We believed that the proposed nano-composite MWCNTs could be opened universal additives for enhancement the electrical conductivity of PPTA."

      "text" : "The nanofibers structures fabricated using polymer materials are predicted to provide marvelous mechanical, electrical, and optical properties, which may have a similarity with many metals or semiconductor nanostructure and are different from their bulk materials. The covalent functionalization of MWCNTs was achieved using inorganic acids for MWCNTs treatment to introduce surface bound functional groups MWCNTs-COOH Scheme 1 [45–47]. This oxidative process of MWNTs can provide promising results for MWNTs surface functionalization for further applications. Indeed, the synthesis of functionalized MWCNTs with PPTA nano-composite samples were succeeded through the mixing of PPTA and MWCNTs in DMF in an ultrasonic bath (Scheme 1C). The presence of small molecules on the surface of the nanotubes facilitates interaction with the polymer matrix and π−π interactions. Increasing of the polymers affinity to adsorbed on CNTs based on the surface charge of the polymer, where the conjugated π-polymer growth over a considerable number of repeated monomer units leading to producing of electronic structure like a band.\nThe HR-TEM images display the structural morphology of pristine and functionalized MWCNTs as shown in Fig. 1. The mesoporous materials are exhibited high ordered morphology [48–50]. The HR-TEM results provided clear difference in the nanotube diameter in the middle of pristine and composite MWCNTs, where the composite MWCNTs diameters have been noticeably larger than pristine ones Fig. 1 (Ba-Bb). Fig. 1A, B showed the morphology of pristine MWCNTs; it can be seen that the MWCNTs surfaces are clean and smooth after oxidation treatment with strong acid, and almost all impurities were removed. The pristine MWCNTs diameters were found around 15 nm. Fig. 1C shows the morphology of MWCNTs after functionalization with PPTA. Fig. 1D indicated that there is increasing in the MWCNTs-COOH diameters after functionalization, this increase in the MWCNTs diameter can be attributed to the coverage of the MWCNTs surface with PPTA. The width of PPTA-MWCNTs-COOH nanofibers was found around 17–25 nm.\nOverall; the analysis of the TEM images investigated that we accomplish good functionalization and coating of MWCNTs using PPTA polymer. In addition the good coating resulting in the disappearance of MWCNTs peaks in the Raman spectra Fig. 2, but in the case of MWCNTs-COOH the coating was more complete than MWCNTs because the carboxylic group was attached to the polymer matrix Fig. 1D.\nRaman spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can be used to emphasize the structure of functionalized MWCNTs during different steps of preparation, including pristine MWCNTs, MWCNTs–COOH, PPTA matrix and PPTA /MWCNTs nano-composite (Fig. 2). The Raman spectrum results indicated the presence of the different peaks characteristic of the MWCNTs and MWNTs-COOH (Fig. 2A). For the MWCNTs, Raman spectrum shows D hoop at 1333 cm−1 nominated through the disordered graphite structure, and the G-band was found around 1565 cm−1, which were clarified to the C]C bond through the graphite plane as well as indicating the existence of crystalline graphitic carbon (Fig. 2A). In addition, the Raman spectrum of MWNTs-COOH presents a characteristic peak associated with D band and G band with little change in the position and intensity, where D band and G band were found at 1346 and 1578 cm−1, respectively [47]. The D and G band of MWCNTs and MWNTs-COOH indicating that MWCNTs were oxidized to MWNTs-COOH without change of their sidewall structure which in good agreement with the HR-TEM results (Fig. 1).\nIt was also well known that the degree of graphitization of MWCNTs was measured based on the excitement amount of D and G bands. The results of the ID/IG ratio can be used to reveal the feature defects of the carbon nanotubes; it was found that the excitement nature of D-band was increased according to the decreasing of G-band. Thus, the largest ID/IG ratio of oxidized-MWCNTs, MWCNTs–COOH, compared with pristine MWCNTs was increased, which indicating the presence of carbon atoms in composite MWCNTs exhibited in amorphous than the pristine MWCNT. Moreover, an acidic using method evolves the carboxylic acid sites in surface area resulting in noteworthy morphological deterioration of MWCNTs [51,52]. The results of PPTA-MWCNTs-\nScheme 1. Schematic of illustration of nano-composite materials of MWCNTs with PPTA, (A) acid treatment of MWCNTs, (B) polymerization of PPTA via polycondenzation process of p-phenylenediamine and terephthalic acid, and (C) functionalization of MWCNTs with PPTA producing nanotubes surface functionalized with repeat units of the PPTA.\nCOOH nanofibers show obvious shifts in the G and D bands compared with MWCNTs-COOH, whereas the G band of PPTA-MWCNTs-COOH and MWCNTs-COOH were detected in 1565 and 1615 cm−1, respectively, and the D bands of PPTA-MWCNTs-COOH and MWCNTs-COOH were detected at 1333 and 1443 cm−1, respectively. The data clearly referred to the strong π–π interaction between MWCNT and the benzene unit in the PPTA [53].\nFor more investigation, the FT-IR analysis was employed to\ncharacterize the structures of MWCNTs, MWCNTs–COOH, PPTA matrix and PPTA /MWCNTs hybrid nano-composite (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A represented the hoop of pristine MWCNTs which defined the C]C stretching aromatic ring at the wave number of around 1634 and CeH bonding of 1346 cm−1, respectively. In case of MWCNTs–COOH that was obtained after the oxidation of MWCNTs where functional groups were introduced to the framework of MWCNTs such as hydroxyl, and carboxylic acid groups, a strong peak associated with the vibration of\nthe OeH group was appearing at 3435 cm−1. Moreover, C]O bonding was found at 1134 cm−1. The carbonyl group (C]O) stretching fluctuations was proved based on the certain peak at 1633 cm−1, and the peak of 1217 cm-1 was obviously of CeO stretching of composite MWCNTs. As seen from Fig. 3A, the existence of C]O, OeH, and CeO groups bands can be attributed to the arrangement of COOH groups decorated to nanotubes after the oxidation process [54]. The data also revealed that both stretching bands in C]O and C]C in PPTA were appearing around at 3430 and 1633 cm−1, respectively. It is observed that he peaks belong to the C]O at 3430cm−1of MWCNTs–COOH was disappeared when dispersed in the polymer which indicated that the COOH was attached to NH of polymer. These results indicate that it is successful introduce the carboxyl group on the surface of MWCNTs.\nWA-XRD analyses of the MWCNTs, PPTA and PPTA-MWCNTs hybrid nano-composites were tested Fig. 4. The diffraction pattern showed a robust characteristic at 2θ= 25·9°, and this was attributed to the graphite based morphology of MWCNTs as judged in Fig. 4A. In addition, the results show several peaks, which represented the high crystallinity of the synthesized polymer nano-composite samples long range ordering [55]. In case of PPTA coating the MWCNTs, the peak of CNTs was disappeared, which was indicating that crystal formation in the PPTA surface. Moreover, the presence of MWCNTs in the nano-composite form was not any changes of PPTA lattice morphology as shown in Fig. 4B. This is also evident that cluster morphology can be achieved after exceeding the weight fraction in the carbon nanotubes [56], and this result was confirmed by TEM.\nIt is well known that high temperature resisted materials is very important for some polymers such as PPTA, accordingly to the nature of high thermal stability of PPTA/MWCNTs nano-composites from the standpoint of real uses. The TGA was used to inspect the thermal stability of PPTA/MWCNTs hybrid nano-composite as the data are depicted in Fig. 5. From this aspect, the MWCNTs were highly stable even in high temperatures. On the other hand, polymeric materials break down when the temperature was 500 0C. TGA can be used as a tool to provide quantitative information about carbon nanotube functionalization. TGA analyses were performed for PPTA, PPTA/MWCNTs and PPTA/MWCNTs-COOH with different ratio 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% at N2 atmosphere in Fig. 5.\nThe results of TGA curves demonstrated the initial mass loss until 250 0C were attributed due to the moisture evaporation, volatilization of reagent. As shown in Fig. 5, the pure PPTA starts to decay (> 10%) around 248 0C and 50% of weight decay were obtained ca. 320 °C. The temperature of 10% and 50% mass loss increased, as well as the char residue wt% at 700 0C after addition of various amounts of weight onto the MWCNTs and MWCNTs-COOH. Moreover, the Table 1 represented\nthe temperature of 10% weight loss, 50% mass loss, and the char residue wt% at 700 °C of all samples. The thermal stability was observed in the ratio (1.5%) of PPTA/MWCNTs and PPTA/MWCNTs-COOH, respectively, due to the decomposition of amorphous carbon and free carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on the side wall of the MWCNTs at elevated temperatures. Due to the Vander Waals force, the MWCNTs can be agglomerated resulting in highly troublesome for dispersing of polymeric groups. Therefore, the nano-composite MWCNT is the best\nway to avoid carbon nanotube gathering, which supports for stabilization nano-composite MWCNTs in the polymeric states [57]. No doubt, the high porosity is desired for anchoring of the molecules in various purposes [58,59]. Generally, the presence of MWCNTs and MWCNTs-COOH chain morphology possesses extreme thermal conductivity, and circulated it to the nano-composite functionalized samples. It is clear from the results that the temperature of the degradation increases with increasing the concentration from 0.5% to 1.5% of MWCNTs and MWCNTs-COOH.\nTo investigate the electrical conductivity both of MWCNTs and MWCNTs-COOH containing PPTA nano-composites, the conductivity of the pure PPTA, PPTA/MWCNTs, and PPTA/MWCNTs-COOH were tested by four probe conductivity measurements at the different temperatures as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6A represented the DC conductivity measurements of PPTA/MWCNTs nano-composite at the different temperatures in the range 25˜130 0C using different contents of MWCNTs. The results ware clarified that the electrical conductivity was very low in the case of pure PPTA and dramatically higher with existing of MWCNT [60,61]. The synthesized polymer was considered as semiconductors in nature in the range of 10−9 (Ω-1/cm-1). Based on the Percolation theory, a certain amount can reflect the composites materials have been highly electrically conductive. Then the electrical conductivity was increased at certain content of MWCNTS (0.5%) at 130 0C, but with increasing the content the conductivity was decreased. The reason is that the PPTA produced circulation over the aggregation of MWCNTs due to its excessive and subsequent electrical conductive channel formation in the presence of functionalized nano-composite MWCNTs. This avoided the conveying the charges through a conductive network [62] and electric conductivity of PPTA/MWCNTs nano-composites are committed by PPTA [63].\nThe electrical conductivity in MWCNTs nano-composites using a percolation threshold was depended by the dispersion and nature of surface modification of MWCNTs, types of polymeric and nano-composite fabrication approaches, the electrical conductivity of the PPTA/ MWCNTs–COOH was achieved more than PPTA/MWCNTs at (0.5%) at 130 0C as clarified in Fig. 6B. The increments of heating afford the enhancement both in free volume and segmental mobility. Because of these two existing and transform the charges from one site to another and enhanced the electrical conductivity performances. Due to the increasing the electrical conductivity, the temperature indicates the high kinetic energy accumulation through the charge carriers in the middle of trapped sites, and this is the evidence of temperature dependency [64]."

The TGA analysis showed an enhancement of thermal stability of the fabricated nano-composite compared with the pure PPTA. Moreover, the electrical conductivity (DC) was extremely high at the certain content of MWCNTs (0.5%) at 130 0C due to the interaction between PPTA and MWCNTs and MWCNTs-COOH that enhances electron delocalization. The results were also indicated that thermal stability and electrical conductivity of PPTA were significantly enhanced after addition of a certain weight of MWCNTs compared with the pure PPTA polymeric samples. Therefore, the PPTA/MWCNTs nano-composites could be used as highly electrically conductive materials as novel nano-composite materials for energy and advanced applications."

In this study, we have reported the specific and sequential functionalization approach for the systematic modification of multi-walled carbon nanotubes with poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) that was prepared via polycondensation method. A novel hybrid material of pristine PPTA/MWNTs nano-composite was designed to produce uniform nanofibers with diameters range over 17–29 nm for electercal conductivity application. A series of PPTA based nano-composite materials were prepared using an ultrasonic bath with various ratios of pristine multi-wall carbon nanotubes and COOHMulti-wall carbon nanotubes (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). The dispersion of multi-wall carbon nanotubes has been inspected by several analyses, Raman’s spectroscopy, which indicated the presence of different peaks characteristic. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the nano-composites were existed in the materials morphology as desired. In addition, the thermal stability of nano-composites was upgraded after with the successful addition multi-wall carbon nanotubes (0.5%), the electrical conductivity was enhanced in the range of 10−8 because of the coupling of PPTA compared with original materials. Based on our finding, we believe that PPTA/multi-wall carbon nanotubes nano-composite materials can act as widespread fillers to enhance the electrical conductivity of novel nano-composite materials for energy and advanced applications.",
