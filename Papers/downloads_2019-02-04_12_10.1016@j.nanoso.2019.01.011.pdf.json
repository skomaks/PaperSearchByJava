Micro-supercapacitors have potential to support tiny micro-electronic devices by replacing or complimenting batteries and electrolytic capacitors. Nanoporous gold (NPG)–Nitrogen doped carbon nano-onions (NCNO) based micro-supercapacitor is an attempt to develop an energy storage unit that is compatible with microelectronic devices. A simple two-step process of thermal evaporation followed by dealloying and electrophoretic deposition were used for NPG growth and NPG–NCNO electrode preparation. The process is economical and easily scalable Nanoporous gold (NPG) is an attractivematerial for current collector due to its three-dimensional interconnected pores with high electrical conductivity and high surface area for NCNO loading. NPG– NCNO micro-supercapacitor device shows an areal capacitance 1.16 mF cm−2. The maximum energy density and power density obtained from NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor were 0.16 µWh cm−2 and 24.87 µW cm−2 at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1 and 200 mVs−1 respectively.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

      "text" : "The reductions in the size and cost of on-chip electronics devices have increased the use of portable electronic devices and wireless sensors network [1]. The development of microelectronics towards small and portable electronic devices has increased the need for micropower sources and small-scale energy storage units [2]. Presently most of the portable microelectronic devices mainly depend on the batteries to get the required power. The\n∗ Corresponding author. E-mail address: paridasm@iitb.ac.in (S. Parida).\nperformance of batteries is limited due to its longer charging duration, lower power density and bigger size compare to microscale devices [3]. The disadvantage of batteries can be surpassed by the use of micro-batteries, but their limited lifetime, low power density and costly maintenance make them unsuitable for application in biosensors and implantable biomedical devices [4]. High power density, long cyclic stability, and fast charge–discharge of supercapacitor make it as an alternative of batteries, but its design is not compatible with microelectronic devices. To solve the design related issues of a supercapacitor, planer interdigital electrode pattern has been developed and called as microsupercapacitor. The interdigital pattern is a planar configuration,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoso.2019.01.011 2352-507X/© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\nand its footprint area is so small that several of them can be packed on a chip. In comparison to the three-dimensional configuration of the conventional supercapacitors, micro-supercapacitors can thus help reduce the size of the device (provided performance is optimized) [5]. In micro-supercapacitors with planar interdigital electrodes, the diffusion length is highly dependent on the gapbetween the electrodes and thickness of active materials, which can be optimized for enhanced performance [6,7]. Micro-supercapacitors are small-scale electrochemical energy storage units, which can be directly integrated into microelectronic devices to provide microscale peak power. Evolution of electronic fabrication technology permits us to incorporate on-chip micro-supercapacitor for high energy and high power support to microelectronic devices [5].\nDifferent types of materials such as various nanocarbon materials, transitionmetal oxides, conducting polymers or combination of them have used as an active electrode for supercapacitor or micro-supercapacitor [8–18]. The charge storagemechanismof the supercapacitor is dependent on the type of material being used as an active electrode material. All carbon-based material show EDLC behavior in which electrostatic charge is stored at the interface between electrolyte and carbon material [19,20]. Transition metal oxides and conducting polymers show pseudocapacitive behavior, where the charge is stored due to faradic reactions [21,22]. Natural abundance and facile accessibility of carbonaceous nanomaterials along with large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and chemical stability make them one of the best candidates for supercapacitor electrodematerials [23]. However low capacitance or energy density of these pure carbon-based materials is an obstacle in the commercialization of supercapacitors [24]. Hence there is a need for chemical modification of the pristine carbonaceous nanomaterials which leads to significantly enhanced electrochemical properties [23]. Introduction of heteroatoms such as B, N, O, S, F, and P into the carbon matrix is one of the ways to modify plain carbonaceous materials and enhance their chemical and electrical properties by providing the pseudocapacitance and improving the wettability of electrodematerials [25–27]. Many studies have been performed which utilize heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials in energy storage applications [25,28–33]. However, nitrogen is the most abundantly investigated heteroatom because of the ease of incorporation of nitrogen into the carbon matrix [23]. Nitrogen dopant has different chemical forms in carbon matrix out of which pyrrolic and pyridinic N sites give rise to pseudocapacitance, while quaternaryN andN-oxide improves the electrical conductivity and facilitates redox reactions involving nitrogen as an active site and hence improves supercapacitive performance [25]. High electronegativity of nitrogen atoms induces high positive charge density on the neighboring carbon atoms causing an increase in the number of binding sites for the electrolyte ions and hence improving its wettability [34–36].\nIn the present work, we are fabricating micro-supercapacitor using three-dimensionally interconnected NPG as a current collector and electrophoretically deposited NCNO as an active material. Electrophoretic deposition occurs due to the motion of charged particles in a solution under the applied electric field. The electrophoretic deposition is a simple, low cost, and promising technique for uniform deposition of thin and thick films [37,38]. NPG– NCNO micro-supercapacitor device shows the maximum areal capacitance, energy density, and power density of 1.16mF cm−2, 0.16 µWh cm−2 and 24.87 µW cm−2 respectively."

The\nflame temperature reaches up to the range of 800−1000 ◦C during the combustion of acetonitrile [39]. Due to its molecular structure, acetonitrile is a source of nitrogen and carbon.

      "text" : "NPG interdigital pattern on Si wafer was prepared by using the previous method reported by our group with slight modification in the thickness of gold and silver layer [40]. Four target e-beam evaporation technique was used to deposit chromium (20 nm), gold (200 nm) and silver (150 nm) layers sequentially. The evaporation was carried out at the chamber pressure of 3.5 * 10−6 mbarmaintaining the distance between source and substrate at 18.5 cm. Diamond cutter was used to separate individual asdeposited micro-supercapacitor. After deposition, annealing was carried out at 150 ◦C for 15 min to get the desired AgAu alloy composition. After formation of Ag83Au17 alloy, NPG interdigital electrode was prepared by dealloying 3.5 M nitric acid solutions for half an hour. On the surface of NPG interdigital electrode, a thin uniform layer of nickel hydroxide was electrodeposited at a constant current of −5 mA. The electrolytic bath used for electrodeposition of nickel contains 0.063M NiSO46H2O, 0.09M NiCl26H2O, 0.03M H3BO3, and 0.02M KNO3. The pH of the bath maintained near 4.5 by adding a drop of concentrated HNO3 acid. The nickel hydroxide acts as an inorganic binder and helps in the deposition of NCNO on NPG interdigital electrode [37,41]. The hydroxyl groups from Ni(OH)2 which are present at the surface act as anchoring sites for the NCNO particles. In NCNO due to electronegativity difference between nitrogen and carbon atoms, the bond between nitrogen dopants and the carbon atom is polarized, and as a result, partial positive charge is developed on the dopant’s neighboring carbon atoms. These partially positively charged carbon atoms are attracted towards the hydroxyl groups of Ni(OH)2, which act as a binder [42]. Fig. 1 shows a process flow of NPG–NCNO microsupercapacitor.\nBefore the electrophoretic deposition, suspension of the NCNO was prepared by adding 5mg of NCNO powder and 2mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant into 25 ml of deionized water. This NCNO suspension was sonicated in a bath sonicator for one hour to achieve homogeneity. The NCNO has been deposited on NPG interdigital electrode by an electrophoretic deposition process using three electrode electrochemical cell, where platinum, NPG, and MSE were used as counter, working and a reference electrode, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 2(b). For the electrophoretic deposition, the stability of the NCNO aqueous dispersion and the presence of the negative surface charge is essential. The later was confirmed by performing zeta potential measurement. The zeta potential of NCNO is –23 mV as shown in Fig. 2(a). The negative surface charge was helpful for carrying out the electrophoretic deposition at +1V."

      "text" : "FIB-SEM cross-sectional imaging was performed on dealloyed NPGelectrode, and electrophoreticallyNCNOcoatedNPGelectrode to determine the thickness of the different layers present in the electrode, as depicted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. A protective carbon layer was deposited prior to milling of the pristine NPG layer. The interconnected porous layer of NPG is clearly visible in pristine NPG layer (Fig. 3(a)) with a thickness of ca.130 nm.\nA low ratemilling procedure was followed for the NCNO coated NPG layers, so that the deposition of any protective layer was not required (Fig. 3(b)). The thickness of NPG–NCNO layer is ca.750 nm. The EDS mapping was conducted after the electrophoretic deposition, as presented in Fig S1 (Supplementary Materials), which shows the presence of the Au, C, N and some amount of silver. The presence of small amount residual silver (∼13 at.%, Fig. S2, Supporting Materials) in the NPG prepared by the dealloying process\nis expected, due to the increase in the diffusion length in the later stage of dealloying.\nThe morphology and microstructure of pristine NCNO were studied using TEM. It can be observed (Fig. 4(a)) that, themorphology of the as-synthesized NCNOs is nearly spherical with a diameter in the range of 32 nm (±6). The quasi-spherical nanoparticles of NCNO are arranged in an interconnected network with interpenetrating graphitic layers at the boundary region. The graphitic layers are arranged in a concentric pattern (Fig. 4(b)),with graphitic interlayer spacing in the range of 0.34 nm [43].\nThe XRD pattern of nanoporous gold–nitrogen-doped carbon nano-onions is shown Fig. 5(a). In the diffractogram, both carbon nano-onion and gold’s diffraction peaks are clearly visible. The broad peak (002) at 22.46◦ corresponds to nitrogen-doped carbon nano-onions, which is similar to nitrogen-doped graphene foam [44]. The gold peaks (111), (002), (022), (113) and (222) correspond to the ICSD card no-98-005-0861. Fig. 5(b) shows selected area electron diffraction pattern ( SAED) of nanoporous gold–nitrogen-doped carbon nano-onions which is in agreement with XRD result.\nFig. 6 shows the Raman spectrum of NPG–NCNO interdigital electrode. It exhibits two main bands, the D-band at 1351 cm−1 and the G-band 1605 cm−1. The D band at 1351 cm−1 arises due to the A1g breathing mode vibration of the aromatic rings present in the graphitic sheets of the carbonnano-onions and it is activated by the presence of an edge or discontinuity (defects) in the carbonnetwork of the graphitic sheets, when the aromatic rings are bound to sp3 carbon atoms at defects sites and near edge [45,46]. The G band\nat 1605 cm−1 is the first-order Raman scattering process corresponds to the in-plane doubly degenerate zone-center phonon E2g mode attributing to the C–C stretching [47,48]. For planar graphite, the G band normally appears at the 1351 cm−1, 1605 cm−1 and 1582 cm−1, but in case of NCNO, it is shifted to 1605 cm−1 due to the tensile strain present in the graphitic plane induced by the curvature [49]. Apart from NCNO peaks, silicon peaks are also shown in Fig. 5. The peak at 521 cm−1 corresponds to the optical first-order Raman peak, the peak observed at 301 cm−1 arises due to second-order transversal acoustic phonon contribution and the broad peak observed from 930–995 cm−1 correspond to secondorder transversal optical phonons [50,51].\nXPS measurements were conducted to investigate the surface elemental composition and bonding configuration of the NCNO. XPS analysis was performed to find out the relative composition of nitrogen, carbon, oxygen and their binding states in NCNO. The presence of nitrogen in carbon-nano-onions matrix enhances the\nelectrical conductivity and improves the wettability of NCNO and electrolyte [52]. This is essential for the better electrochemical performance of micro-supercapacitor. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the survey spectrum of NCNO indicates the presence of C1s peak at 284 eV, a pronounced N1s peak at 399 eV and a weak O1s peak at 533 eV. High-resolution XPS spectrum of N1s peak is fitted into four individual peaks representing different chemical states of nitrogen positioned at 399.1, 400.8, 402.4 and 404.1 eV as illustrated in Fig. 7(b). The peak located at 399.1 eV is attributed to pyridine-type (N-1) or pyrrole-type nitrogen (N-2), which donates π-electron density into carbon network and contribute to the sp2 character of the graphitic shells of NCNO [53]. These N groups are responsible for the pseudocapacitive character [54]. The peak positioned at 400.8 eV is due to the quaternary nitrogen (N-3) attributed to central graphitic N (N-Qcenter), which arises when carbon atoms in the central position are replaced by N atoms. The peak at 402.3 eV corresponds to quaternary nitrogen (N-3)\nattributed to the valley or terminal graphitic N (N-Qvalley) which arises when terminal carbon atoms are replaced by N atoms [55– 57]. In either case, N is bonded to three sp2-hybridizedC atoms and is positively charged due to electron transfer from N to the π-electron cloud of carbon atoms. These substituted N-Qcenter and N-Qvalley groups within the NCNO shells effectively enhance the electronic conductivity [54]. The peak at 404.1 eV represents either nitrogen oxides or π-excitations [56,58]. Moreover, XPS analysis revealed a high nitrogen content for NCNO (4.02 at.%) in which N-1 and N-2 together accounted for 73 at.% and N-3 contributed 22 at.%. The high-resolution C1s peak in NCNO (Fig. 7(c)) has five components centered at 284.5, 285.3, 286.3, 288 and 289.2 eV. Peaks at 284.5, 285.3 and 286.3 correspond to graphite-like sp2 C, N-sp2 C, and N-sp3 C bonds, respectively, originating from the substitutional doping of nitrogen atoms whereas peaks at 288 and 289.2 eV correspond to C==O and O−C==O groups [54,59]. The different chemical states of nitrogen atoms in NCNO is shown in Fig. 7(d). The XPS analysis of NPG–NCNO interdigital electrode is shown in Fig. 7(e). XPS survey spectrum for NPG–NCNO shows the presence of C, N, Ni, Cr, Au, and Ag. The peak positions corresponding to 284 eV, 399 eV and 858.2 eV are C1s, N1s and Ni 2p3/2 sat respectively [60,61].\nFEG-SEM was performed to examine the surface morphology of interdigital electrodes after different steps as shown in Fig. 8. Sponge-like nanoporous gold (NPG) with three-dimensional interconnected networks resulting in a high surface area is clearly visible in Fig. 8(a). In Fig. 8(b) NPG electrode surface with electrophoretically deposited NCNO shows a uniform deposition of NCNO on NPG. The low magnification image of NPG–NCNO interdigital electrode with interspaces is shown in Fig. 8(c). The NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor with PVA-H2SO4 gel electrolyte is shown in Fig. 8(d)with awidth (W), length (L) and interspaces (I). The total area of the device is 44.66 mm2 including gaps between interspaces."

      "text" : "For electrochemical characterization of NPG–NCNO microsupercapacitor PVA-H2SO4 gel was utilized as an electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was performed at a series of a different scan rate 10–200 mV s−1 in the potential window of 1 V as shown in Fig. 9(a). The CV plot shows quasi-rectangular behavior at lower scan rates, that is similar to previous reports [62]. The charge storage mechanism of electrode materials can be characterized from cyclic voltammetry experiment by plotting a function of scan rates. When the peak current is directly proportional to scan rate,\nthen the process is surface controlled, and if the peak current is proportional to square root of scan rate, then the process is semiinfinite bulk diffusion control [40]. Fig. 9(b) shows a linear relationship between discharge current and scan rates for NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor. The linear graph suggests the process is surface controlled. The areal capacitance of micro-supercapacitor was calculated by using equations [40,63].\nCA =\n∫ V −V idV V ( dVdt )A (1)\nwhere CA is areal capacitance (F cm−2), V is a potential window (V), dVdt is scan rate (V/s) and A is the footprint area including interspaces gap (cm2) of the micro-supercapacitor. The areal capacitance at different scan rates as shown in Fig. 9(c). The areal capacitance decreases with increasing scan rates. This behavior can be explained by the fact that at lower scan rates electrolyte ions has a longer time to access the bulk of electrode surface while at higher scan rates ions have less time and its movement is limited only to the surface of electrode materials [64]. Fig. 9(d) shows galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves at different current density. The nonlinearity in GCD curves might be due to the surface functionalities present on NCNO. The maximum areal capacitance 1.16 mF cm−2 was obtained at the scan rate 10mV s−1. This areal capacitance is comparablewith other carbonbasedmicro-supercapacitor such as 0.7mF cm−2 for inkjet-printed graphene [65], 0.08 mF cm−2 for graphene [63], 1.5 mF cm−2 for carbide-derived carbon [66], 1.7 mF cm−2 for onion-like carbon [67] and 2.32 mF cm−2 for graphene [68] previously reported in the literature. The NCNO particles deposited per unit area of the electrode in the electrophoretic process is calculated to be 7.18 µgm cm−2 (Supporting Materials). Assuming contribution from only deposited NCNO (with specific surface area, SBET ∼ 842 m2 g−1, Supporting Materials, Fig S3), the calculate gravimetric capacitance of NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor was 259 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1.\nGiven the Ragone plot is used to represent the relationship between energy density and power density of energy storage devices. Ragone plot of NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor at different scan rates is depicted in Fig. 9(e). The specific energy (EA) and specific power (PA) calculated by using Eqs. (2) and (3) [40,63].\nEA ( Wh cm−2 ) =\n1 2∗3600 CAV2 (2)\nPA ( W cm−2 ) =\nEA V ( dV dt ) ∗ 3600 (3)\nwhere CA (F cm−2) is areal capacitance including interspaces gap, V is a potential window (V) and dVdt is scan rate. Themaximumenergy density and power density that can be obtained from NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor are 0.16 µWh cm−2 and 24.87 µW cm−2 at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and 200 mV s−1 respectively. A comparison of the values of the specific capacitance, energy density and power density is presented in Table S1 (Supporting materials). Capacitance retention of NPG–NCNO micro-supercapacitor was performed at 1 mA cm−2 for 10000 cycles as shown in Fig. 9(f). It shows good cyclic stability with nearly 80% capacitance retention up to 10000 cycles."

Nanoporous gold (NPG) with three-dimensional gold networks with interconnected pores is an attractive and promisingmaterial for the loading of NCNO (or any other active material) due to its high electrical conductivity andhigh surface area.
