      "text" : "The combination of biomechanical compatibility and low elastic modulus contributing to high mechanical and bioactive properties makes the -Ti alloys promising for biomedical applications [1–12]. The high bio-degradability low modulus (−40 GPa) of Mg makes it attractive for biomedical applications such as resorbable bolts, screws and biodegradable orthopaedic implants [13–23]. Currently, the most commonly applied orthopaedics biomaterials are pure titanium and the Ti6Al4V alloys which are used to manufacture components of dentistry, bone screw and bone implants. The -stabilizing elements, such as Cr, Ta, Mo and Zr, are applied as safe alloying elements to titanium which are proved to be non-allergic and nontoxic [24–29]. Moreover, alloys have better mechanical\n∗Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed.\nproperties and lower elastic modulus than or + alloys [30–32]. Recent, more and more metal nanomaterials with excel-\nlent properties are emerging constantly with the development of nanotechnology, which make great progress in biomedical materials and medical fluorescent materials [33–41]. Developments in selective laser melting (SLM) have gained considerable interest due to their ability to fabricate various shaped components [42–47]. Research is focus on the SLM fabrication parameter, microstructural features and mechanical response as well as scanning strategies process parameters on phase transformation behavior and temperatures [48, 49]. The growing interest in selective laser melting has generated a need for developing a detailed understanding of successful processing techniques to both for enhancing the material properties and reducing production costs [50, 51].\nJ.

For this study, the reason for choosing Ti–20Mg–5Ta alloys compositions is based on our previous research outputs and countless experiments. We suggest applying the cross-scan strategy and HotIsostatic Pressing (HIP) post-treatment to eliminate nonhomogeneities and discoloration. This study will focus on microstructure and texture of SLMed Ti–20Mg–5Ta alloys with considering different fabrication parameters as well as scanning strategies."

      "heading" : "4. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "In the present study, we have developed a novel Ti–20Mg– 5Ta alloys via selective laser melting for orthopaedic applications. The advantage of the new developed crossscanning strategy compared to the conventional strategies are remarkable mechanical properties and lower elastic modulus. The cross-scan strategy can refine the microstructure and induce various deformation textures in contrast to the conventional scanning strategies. In addition, the developed cross-scan strategy is possible to change alloys from phase and phase and finally into stable phase as cross-scan can completely melt the alloys powder and eliminate phase. The Ti–20Mg–5Ta alloys with stable phase exhibited lower modulus than that of conventional Ti-based alloys. We have obtained the result that the applied different scan strategies have a major influence on mechanical properties and appropriate elastic modulus. The densification level was mainly influenced by different scanning strategy. Densification 95± 0.42% was achieved using the cross-scanning strategy compared to vertical and parallel scanning strategy. It is possible that the SLM process using cross-scan strategy can completely melt the Ti–20Mg–5Ta alloys powder, contributing the highest densification. The newly developed Ti–20Mg–5Ta alloys have demonstrated themselves as promising candidate of biomedical materials with outstanding mechanical properties and lower elastic modulus.\nAcknowledgments: The work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LY17E050027).\nReferences and Notes 1.
