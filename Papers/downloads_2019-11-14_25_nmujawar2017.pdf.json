INTRODUCTION\nEnergy is considered as a fundamental and key ingredient in all sectors of all economies in order to maintain a high quality of life. The demand for energy is increasing day by day due to enhanced industrialization and increased population. Energy demand in 2050 will be approximately doubled today’s level [1]. Fossil fuel usage to supply such energy causes environmental pollution in terms of greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, energy production from renewable sources and pollution reduction will be significant factors to be considered in economic and social development. One of the solutions to the above mentioned problems due to fossil fuel usage is utilization of carbon based structural materials for energy purposes. However, the production of carbonaceous materials often has drawbacks such as it requires harsh conditions. One example is the production of activated carbon, which requires high temperature, generally greater than 800oC, followed by chemical or physical activation [2].\n*Address correspondence to these authors at the School of Engineering, RMIT University, 3001 Melbourne, Australia and Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Science, Curtin University, 98009 Sarawak, Malaysia; Tel: +60 85443939 Ext 2414; Fax: +60 85 443837; E-mails: mubarak.yaseen@gmail.com; mubarak.mujawar@curtin.edu.my (N.M Mubarak), nizamuddin248@gmail.com (Sabzoi Nizamuddin).\nNanomaterials are functional materials which comprise of at least one dimension less than 100 nm. An important property of nanomaterials is that their characteristics can be completely different from the parent bulk material; for example, silver metal does not show antimicrobial activity but silver nanoparticles do [3]. Carbon nanomaterials can be synthesized from any type of hydrocarbon or carbonaceous materials using established conditions in order to get a desired product. Different precursors including acetylene, benzene, methane, toluene and xylene have been used to synthesize carbon nanomaterials. In order to meet the growing demand of carbon nanomaterials in future, it is important to seek renewable precursors as a substitute for fossil fuel based precursors, which are likely to be depleted in future. Sharon et al. [4] have conducted an extensive research work on utilization of plant based precursors including seeds of plants (sunflower, soybean, betel nut, bitter almond, kardi, date palm) and fibres of plants (cotton, tea leaves, rice stems, coconut, jute, bagasse, corn stems, bamboo) for the synthesis of different forms of carbon nanomaterials.\nCarbon structured nanomaterials have been studied extensively over the past three decades. A detailed structural study of carbon materials were recognised as significant after Iijima et al. [5] discovered carbon nanotubes in 1991. The potential applications for nanostructures include: a catalyst support material for fuel cells; a media for gas storage; electrode materials for super-capacitors;\n1875-5348/18 $58.00+.00 © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers\nmicrowave absorbers; carbon solar cells; an adsorbent; energy storage; cellular delivery, and; adsorbents for controlled drug release [6-16].\nTo date, various methods for the production of nanostructured materials have been studied including: electron irradiation; arc discharge; chemical vapour deposition; laser pyrolysis; microwave plasma; metal-catalysed methods; hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), and; metallic reduction-pyrolysis-catalytic methods, [4, 17- 21]. The main objective of this study is to review the production of carbon nanomaterials using HTC and pyrolysis of different types of biomass. Furthermore, chemical, physical, and structural properties of HTC nanomaterial and pyrolysis nanomaterials are also compared."

Different synthesis methods and different catalysts/additives have been discovered and utilized for the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials. Among different processes available for the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials, pyrolysis and HTC are newly developed methods and are receiving much attention from researchers.

      "text" : "HTC is considered as a promising route for the production of nanomaterials [25]. HTC was first introduced by Bergius and Specht in 1913; coal like carbon products were obtained by hydrothermal transformation of cellulose with water at 250-310oC [26]. The carbon product had low oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio, which confirmed the significance of the process [27]. Further investigations, modifications and improvement in HTC were discovered by Berl and Schmidt in 1932 by converting different saccharides into solid product at 150-350oC [26]. Generally, HTC is a thermal heating of a mixture of biomass and water in a closed vessel at elevated pressures (2-10 MPa) and high temperatures (180-250oC) for a reaction time of a few hours to a few days [28]. Besides being a simple and fast process, it is an energy efficient process also. HTC can process wet feedstock so saving the energy required for drying of biomass. Additionally, the use of wet feedstock results in an effective dehydration process, ultimately improving the quality of the end product. In addition, the final carbon product can be easily filtered and separated from the slurry. Further, the carbon efficiency of HTC process approaches to 100%; practically, all carbon in the starting feedstock material/biomass stays bound within the final carbon product. The final product of HTC holds 55-90% mass and 80-90% of the energy content of the original mass of feedstock [29, 30].\nIn the last two decades, HTC has been studied for the production of carbon nanomaterials from different materials including carbohydrates and crude plant materials [21, 25]. The main advantage of this method is that it does not need any strong acid solvent or any reagent for surface passivation. Carbon materials production through hydrothermal processes is a sustainable, scalable and cost effective method [31]. The synthesis occurs in an aqueous solution and the process is considered a cheap and green process [32]. However, HTC products may contain some functional groups [33] there-\nfore subsequent steam or chemical activation needs to be carried out for certain goals [34]. The carbon materials can be produced from both direct HTC and catalysed HTC as shown in Fig. (1). Titirici et al. [25] studied direct synthesis of carbon nanomaterials by HTC of crude plant material including pine cones, pine needles, oak leaves, sugar beet chips, and orange peels. Typically, 5-20 g of feed biomass was mixed with 40 mL of distilled water together with 10 mg of citric acid. The solution was hydrothermally carbonized at 180-250oC for 16 hours. A typical carbon structured material, similar to lignite and peat chemically and spectroscopically, was successfully produced. The chemical and structural properties were dependent on reaction temperature and time. In this way, production of carbon nanomaterials is possible using low temperature HTC techniques. Low temperature processing ranging from 130 to 180°C, utilizing low pressure and operational times from a few hours to several days can produce highly symmetrical nanostructures using Teflon lined autoclave reactor. Ryu et al. [35] produced meso-porous carbon nanospheres by using fructose and xylose as a carbon source at 130 to 170°C over 12 hours of operation. Similarly another study reported the production of nitrogen-carbon nanostructures by using a low temperature hydrothermal process on glucosamine material at 140°C over a 12 hour processing time [36]. The HTC of glucose and carbohydrates is a well-known technique for the production of carbon spheres. Cui et al. [37] studied catalytic HTC of starch and rice carbohydrates. The effects of free iron ions and iron oxide nanoparticles used to catalyse the HTC reaction were studied. The study concluded that both iron ions and iron oxide nanoparticles have an effect on the kinetics of HTC of starch and rice grain. Further, it was found that hollow and massive carbon microspheres were produced in the presence of iron ions whereas very fine, rope-like carbon nanostructures were formed in the presence of iron oxide catalysts. It has been confirmed in literature that the presence of metal ions can enhance the HTC process and various forms of carbon/metal nanostructures may be formed. Carbon nanofibers, Ag/carbon nanocables, carbon nanospheres and Ag/carbon-rich composite micro-cables have been synthesized through catalytic HTC [38-42]. The production and synthesis of carbon nanofibers have been reported at high temperatures and high pressures in the presence of metal catalyst [38, 43, 44]. Table 1 lists an overview of studies conducted for the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials at different conditions using the HTC method.\nThe reaction mechanism for the formation of carbon spheres from HTC of carbohydrate includes the dehydration reaction of carbohydrates to furan-like molecules, followed by polymerization and carbonization reactions [2, 45]. Ryu et al. [35] suggested a mechanism of formation of carbon spheres from sugars and phenolic compounds: dehydration of sugars takes place into furan compounds in the first step; after that the formed furans react with phenolic compounds to form soluble polymers, then; these soluble polymers undergo aromatization through keto-enol tautomerisation, and; C=C bonds are formed as shown in Scheme 1. Finally, nucleation and subsequent growth take place. A similar reaction mechanism for the formation of carbon spheres from sugars was reported by Sevilla and Fuertes [46, 47]. According to Sun and Li [42] the growth of carbon spheres confirms the LaMer model as shown in Fig. (2). The final particle size of the end-product predominantly depends upon the reaction time for carbonization, followed by the concentration of precursor, stabilizers and additives used in the reaction [45]. According to Tang et al. [48] the reaction time, microwave power, volume of solution and concentration of source\nmaterial have a significant effect on the growth of graphene dots. Another study reports that the diameter of the final product increased from 200 nm to 500 nm, 800 nm, 1100 nm, and 1500 nm by increasing the reaction time from 2 h to 4, 6, 8, and 10 h respectively while keeping the temperature and concentration constant [42]. Carbon nanomaterials produced from HTC have various applications including biological, catalysis, energy and environmental applications as listed in Fig. (3)."

Reaction pathways for pyrolysis.\nPyrolysis of biomass residue may generate carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and gaseous effluents; for instance H2, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons [66]. Reactions pathway for pyrolysis includes cracking, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, hydrocracking, hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation (Scheme 2) [67].\nCarbon nanomaterials are potentially of great importance because of their unique thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, thus they have a wide range of applications [68-70]. A number of synthesis methods for carbon nanomaterials have been developed such as laser ablation, arc discharge, chemical vapour deposition, flame synthesis, catalytic chemical vapour deposition, and high temperature hydrothermal conversion [71, 72]. These techniques work under harsh conditions and the high cost for nanomaterials production through these techniques limit their usage [66, 71]. In order to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and limits, the pyrolysis of biomass may be more economical. Pyrolysis does not operate at harsh conditions, and the cost of feedstock material can be minimized by utilization of biomass waste as a precursor for the production of carbon nanomaterials. Further, process costs also may be minimized by burning of waste biomass to provide thermal energy for the process [66]. Both direct pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis can effectively generate carbon nanomaterials. Factors including interaction between carbon sources, process parameters, type of catalyst, and precursor material affect the formation of carbon nanomaterials. Any change in any of these factors may significantly affect the final product. A major requirement for a precursor for carbon nanomaterials production is its capacity to provide a considerable amount of gas-phase carbon [66, 70].\nAmong other factors, the catalyst is of paramount importance in the production of carbon nanomaterials. The catalyst is used with feedstock during pyrolysis as it is helpful in improving the conversion efficiency of the feedstock [73, 74]. Metal-catalysed pyrolysis\nfor carbon nanomaterials generation has attained much recognition. Cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), and nickel (Ni) are effective catalysts reported in the literature [75-78]. The reaction pathways and related products of catalytic pyrolysis of biomass are shown in Scheme 3 [67]. Compbell et al. [18] used Ni-Fe thin film as a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes. Troiani et al. [20] synthesized carbon anions using gold nanoparticles and electron irradiation. Du et al. [17] reported synthesis of carbon nanoflower in the presence of magnesium and ferrocene. Liu et al. [19] produced carbon nanotubes through thermal reduction of ethanol with magnesium. Yu et al. [79] successfully prepared carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers through catalytic pyrolysis of acetylene with iron nanoparticles. Lin and Li [80] reported the formation of carbon nanotubes through catalytic pyrolysis of poly ethylene glycol in the presence of nickel as a catalyst. An overview of carbon nanomaterials production from pyrolysis is listed in Table 2."

      "text" : "The morphology of carbon spheres is affected by various parameters employed during HTC including: temperature; time; pH; type of catalysts; additives, and; type and concentration of material to be treated [2, 16, 37, 42, 85, 86]. To engineer nanoparticles of absolute symmetrical uniformity of shape and size is still a challenge. Studies were conducted to investigate the morphological changes at the surface of nanoparticles for varying process parameters during HTC by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Cui, et al. [37] reported the use of Fe2O3 based material not only catalysed efficiently but also was capable of producing rope shape nanoparticles during HTC [37]. It was found that the diameter of nanoparticles generally increases\nScheme 3. Reaction pathways for catalytic pyrolysis.\nwith the increase in temperature, which is the most significant parameter for HTC. Sevilla et al. [46] studied the synthesis of functional carbonaceous materials using cellulose with HTC at 220, 230, 240 and 250ºC. The change in temperature resulted in interesting behaviour as shown by the SEM images of (Figs. 4(a-e)). At 210ºC, the SEM images show the cellulose had an irregular structure of pristine cellulose crystals when the temperature increases by 10ºC, these crystal structures agglomerate. With a further 10ºC increase to 230ºC, the crystals with their irregular morphologies started to take a spherical structure and a further increase in temperature resulted in getting more regular spherical shape up to 240ºC. Finally, as temperature was further raised by 10ºC to 250ºC,\nthe spherical structures grew in size. This is due to the fact that, with higher temperatures in hydrothermal processing, light particles accumulate together as polymerization takes place inside the particles [16]. Recent findings about the effects of HTC on morphology of nanoparticles have led to a new direction in research. Cakan et al. [87] studied the carbon/silicon composite formed from HTC of glucose followed by further carbonization in a N2 environment at 900ºC and successfully produced perfectly spherical particles of 200 nm which were evaluated using TEM. A clear explanation of this phenomena can be seen from the investigation by Fuertes et al. [88].

      "text" : "HTC is responsible for the production of carbonaceous products with the property of micro-porosity which enables its application as a nanomaterial in adsorption processes, catalysis and as a supercapacitor [45]. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller is a useful method to find the surface area, total pore volume, micro-pore volume and average pore width of the material. These key properties of a nanomaterial produced through HTC also depend on different processing factors. Well-ordered carbon nanospheres with a uniform structure were produced by controlled hydrothermal processing utilizing a polymer F127 phenolic resole as the main carbon material [16]. It was observed that by changing the concentration of phenol/water from 1:200 to 1:450 the diameter of nanosphere was reduced from 140 nm to 20 nm. The initial concentration of phenol was indirectly proportional to nanosize of mesoporous carbon. It is also interesting to note that the BET properties also varied with change of concentration. Analysis was reported on using different agricultural waste material including orange peel, oak leave, pine cone and pine needle for the production of mesoporous carbon [45]. The hydrothermal conditions were kept uniform including temperature and time. BET analysis for all materials measured a different average surface area and meso-porous size ranging from 0.2 to 34 m2/g with mesoporous size of 12 to 30 nm. So, different materials subjected to the same conditions for HTC can produce significantly different products. The study also reported that elimination of water from carbohydrates decreased the volume of HTC treated carbonaceous material up to 10-100 nm. The initial concentration of material also has a significant impact on the surface characteristics of the nanomaterial. An increase in surface area of carbonaceous materials has been reported from 10 m2/g to 572 m2/g at high temperature. The use of poly ionic liquids as additives in HTC reported significant increase in BET surface area of nanomaterial [89]. The use of iron particles in HTC also leads to production of much finer nanoparticles which can be useful for increasing the average surface area of carbon nanomaterial produced thus the product is suitable for application in\nadsorption of heavy metals [90]. Concentration of iron oxide also plays a significant role in increasing the porosity of carbon nanomaterial [85]. Table 3 compares the BET analysis of various HTC treated material."

      "text" : "Raman Spectroscopy is a well-known technique extensively used to examine molecular structure and is also used to find the degree of graphitization of carbon materials when using micro Raman spectrophotometer [91]. The ratio of D and G band (ID/IG) is considered an important aspect for determining the degree of graphitization. When analysed by Raman Spectroscopy, considerable modification was found in molecular structure of nanoparticles produced by materials treated by HTC. Many researchers reported that nanomaterials produced from HTC are amorphous in nature [71, 89, 91]. Zheng et al. studied HTC of sucrose, glucose and starch at 550oC for 12 h in the presence of ethanol. It was reported that D and G bands at 1330 and 1600 with ID/IG ratio of 0.63 were found and that all three materials were low amorphous materials. Another study confirmed the amorphous nature for nitrogen doped carbon structures produced through HTC and determined a D and G curve of 1350 cm-1 and 1590 cm-1 [91].\nThe carbon structure of hydrothermally treated material has also been observed by x-ray diffraction analysis. Most of the reports for the production of carbon nanomaterials from HTC claimed that the material was amorphous in nature [32, 71, 89, 91, 92]. XRD was analysed for nitrogen-doped carbon material and a single broad reflection for 2 theta was derived from the analysis. Another peak was observed at 45º degrees and therefore a similar result as of Raman was described that is amorphous carbon. For the case of iron coating with a different scenario was seen by hydrothermally processed carbonaceous material for two different methods one pot synthesis and impregnation method using pinewood sawdust [85]. Some micro-crystallinity in carbonaceous material was observed when HTC was performed on material containing iron material through impregnation. The nanomaterial was found to be 11.2 to 19.5% crystalline and this may be due to the nanomaterial containing iron oxide. One reason for this may be due to catalytic active Fe metal which tends to lower the state of graphene. An interesting difference was seen in analysis in impregnation and one pot synthesis of carbon nanocomposite that the micro-crystallinity\nTable 2.

      "text" : "As pyrolysis is a simple and effective process there has been a large number of research work performed on the production of nanomaterials through pyrolysis. Consequently, vast data is available reporting SEM and TEM of various carbon nanomaterials produced using pyrolysis. A novel nanostructured material was produced through a catalytic, reduction pyrolysis method using a mixture of magnesium powder, ferrocene and glycerine at 650ºC [17]. With the help of SEM and TEM, a flower nanostructure carbon material was produced with size ranging from 200 to 600 nm and 5 nm thickness with a hollow core. Catalyst type and temperature are the most significant factors capable of causing variation in structural morphology of carbonaceous nanomaterial. A catalyst with composition of 67% iron, 18-20% chromium and 11% nickel was used for the production of carbon nanomaterial from the residue of bioethanol production using pyrolysis followed by chemical vapour deposition [66]. A variety of highly dense structured non-uniform carbon materials were formed from pyrolysis at temperatures between 600-1000ºC in the presence of catalyst. These structures\ninclude cylindrical, twisted crook form shaped, perfect tabular form (normally carbon nanotubes) and multi walled nanostructure with size ranges of 20 to 200 nm as found in high resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Carbon nanofiber and nanotubes were successfully synthesised by catalytic pyrolysis using acetylene. The temperature was the most influential parameter on carbon structure in the process; ribbon-like carbon nanofibers of 60 to 80 nm were formed at 650ºC and also carbon nanotubes with different morphology was formed as temperature increased to 710ºC [79]. Utilization of laser pyrolysis for treating gas phase precursors toluene and acetylene with iron pentacarbonyl as an iron source resulted in two series of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles exhibited irregular shape particles less than 5 nm in size and dark, uneven structure particles ranging from 4-15 nm in size as seen from HRTEM images [94]. Similarly, using different catalysts such as Ni and Co for production of carbon nanotubes showed different morphological characteristics from pyrolysis of polyethylene precursor [95]. Recent findings regarding the relationship of iron catalyst to morphology of nanomaterial have been reported. The research utilized bagasse for microwave assisted pyrolysis with the addition of 13-50% of iron as a catalyst for the production of carbon nanomaterial at 500oC and 600 W [83]. The impact on structural morphology from various concentrations of iron catalyst can be seen from (Figs. 5(a-d)). Initially, during microwave aided pyrolysis without catalyst, no nanoparticles were observed from SEM analysis as displayed in (Fig. 5(a)). When 13% of iron was used in the experiment, nanoparticles of 30 nm were produced as shown in (Fig. 5(b)). When further increasing the concentration of catalyst, tube\nshaped nanoparticles were seen to be grown to an approximate size of 110 nm as shown in (Fig. 5(c)). Finally, when the iron concentration was further increased to 50% in the experiment, the nanoparticles sizes also increased to 160 nm as shown in (Fig. 5(d)). Therefore, a direct relationship was seen for nanoparticle size with the concentration of catalyst. The types of carbon precursors also act as an important factor that impacts the configuration of the nanostructure. Sharon et al. [4] reported the production of carbon nanomaterial using various plant resources using pyrolysis at 750°C for 2 hours. Carbon nanomaterial produced by using jute fiber, rice stem and bagasse exhibited channel-type porous morphology however tea leaves fabricated a very special type of structure."

      "text" : "Pyrolysis consists of two main stages. In the first stage, removal of moisture and volatile material takes place due to the high temperature at which the pyrolysis operates. In the second stage, high porosity is developed due to the removal of volatile components from material [96]. BET surface area is dependent on various factors. Generally, with a decrease of nanoparticle size, the surface area of the carbon nanomaterial increases. It was reported that there was significant difference in external surface and micropore areas of nanoNiO and micro-NiO material – values of 179.2 and 8.8 m2/g, and 24.5 and 4.1 m2/g respectively were reported [97]. From TEM analysis, it was found that the use of 13% iron catalyst in microwave assisted pyrolysis for the treatment of bagasse indicated presence of 30 nm nanoparticles, therefore porosity was significantly increased to 227 m2/g as micropore area [83]. When comparing carbonaceous materials produced using 13% iron catalyst and not using catalyst, comparatively lower micropore area of 129 m2/g was found in the absence of catalyst. This shows the importance of iron catalyst in the pyrolysis process as a significant factor to increase porosity of the nanocarbon. The enhancement of porosity using iron catalysts has also been confirmed by other studies [98]. However, addition of iron up to 25 to 50%, results in a significant decrease of porosity of carbonaceous material with a drop in surface area to 111 and 39 m2/g. The reason for the reduction in porosity is due to an overloading of iron which results in destruction of various sites [99]. Similar findings were found when nickel nanoparticles were used for pyrolysis of rice husk at 700ºC [100]. A maximum BET area of 218 m2/g for the nanomaterial produced was observed when using 49.13 mg of nickel/gram of rice husk. When the amount of catalyst was increased to 51.9 and 55.2 mg nickel/gram of rice husk, the BET surface area was reduced to 135 and 87 m2/g, respectively. A mixture of high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene powders was successfully utilized to produce multi-walled carbon nanotubes at 700ºC in the presence of catalyst with a micropore surface area, of 76.3 m2/g [95]. Similarly, different metallic salts were also used to increase the BET area of meso-porous carbon material. A study used a combination of MgCl2 and CuCl2 to enhance BET area of corncob material thorough pyrolysis using a 1:2 ratio of CuFe2O4:biochar [101]. The nanomaterial produced had spinal structure with a high BET area of 558 m2/g which was tested for the adsorption of acid orange II."

      "text" : "Raman spectra analysis is a useful tool to differentiate between graphitic and amorphous carbon according to the structural properties of the specific nanomaterial. Raman spectroscopy analysis of nanomaterials produced by pyrolysis was reported in various research reports – as with similar material processed with HTC, most of the material produced was found to be graphitic in nature [17,\n81, 102]. The flower like nanosphere formed by reduction pyrolysis catalysis method found two peaks at the D and G band at 1339 and 1580 cm-1 respectively which represent highly disordered carbon vibrations of Sp2 bonded nanostructure [17]. Carbon nanodots produced by rapid pyrolysis exhibited similar characteristics with D and G band at 1350 cm-1 and 1580 cm-1 indicating the amorphous nature of disordered, bonded carbon structure of Sp2 and Sp3 hybridization [81]. In most of the cases, the D and G band were found between 1300 and 1600 cm-1 for nanomaterial produced by pyrolysis. The precursor material is another key factor responsible for the production of well-ordered or disordered nanomaterial. A research report compared results of Raman spectroscopy of nanoparticles which were produced from two different feedstocks i.e. bagasse and corn-based residue at 600-1000°C using catalytic pyrolysis - refer to (Figs. 6(a-b)) [66]. The higher IG/ID ratio shows higher purity, more ordered structure and lower defects in the nanomaterial [76]. From comparative analysis, the IG/ID ratio of nanomaterial formed by bagasse at 600 and 1000oC was found to be 1.14 and 1.25, while that of corn-based residue at 600 and 1000oC was 0.83 and 0.89, respectively. Therefore it shows that the purity of nanomaterial produced using bagasse is higher compared with the nanomaterial produced using corn-based residue. Further, it is found by Raman spectroscopy that use of iron particles with different concentration in pyrolysis causes some small fraction of the nanomaterial into crystalline structure [83].\nA growing body of literature has reported structural aspects of nanomaterial produced by pyrolysis through XRD analysis. The XRD results matched results from Raman spectroscopy for nanomaterial produced by utilizing iron particles whereby some peaks indicative of crystalline structure were observed although the material was classified as amorphous carbon with a broad range from 20 to 25˚ [23]. Therefore, a slight transformation to crystalline structure was noted by using iron particles for production of nanomaterial. Similarly, results have recently been reported in which AgNO3 was impregnated on cellulose for the production of nanomaterial through pyrolysis [103]. It was observed that 20-200 nm silver part was produced which displayed crystalline structure from XRD analysis. Polymer pyrolysis was utilized with gallium as a doping material with ZnO nanoparticles [104]. The nanomaterial produced indicated that some perfect crystal lattices influenced by the deposition of gallium ion. To study the relation of process temperature and XRD peak structure, carbon nanotube were produced from pyrolysis of waste polypropylene at varying temperature from 600 to 800oC in the presence of Ni [105]. It was observed that 2 theta was found in very broad range from 20 to 85˚. The graphitic content was observed from the analysis and as the temperature increased the impurities were reduced. Minimum impurities were noted at 800oC."

      "text" : "Recent advancements in nanotechnology enabled the production of nanostructured materials with controlled and fascinating properties. There are several applications of carbon nanomaterials in the field of catalysis; biomedical engineering, fuel cells, solar cells, chemical sensors, electro-analysis, hydrogen storage and so on. Carbon nanomaterials are chemically stable and have high specific areas and electrical conductivities. These properties suggest the application of carbon nanomaterials as support for dispersion and stabilization of catalyst nanoparticles is viable. Furthermore, metallic catalysts supported by carbon nanomaterials show excep-\ntional catalytic activities for many organic reactions [106, 107]. Moreover, small metal nanocrystals may descend and become isolated due to the unavailability of micropores in the carbon nanomaterial. This property is an advantage for carbon nanomaterials as catalysts supports; the lack of micro-pores may enhance the adsorption properties and residence time of the reactants and products on the carbon nanomaterials [108]. Other than use as supporting materials, CNTs may also act as prototypes in modifying the size of metal particles, particularly for those filled in the carbon nanomaterials [109, 110]. Carbon nanomaterials can also be used for energy conversion processes such as in energy conversion devices due to its distinctive electrical and electronic properties and wide electrochemical stability. Inorganic nanomaterials often act as functional materials in energy conversion devices such as inorganic nanoparticles utilized as catalysts in fuel cells which facilitate generation of electron–hole pairs in solar cells [111]. Another development in the use of carbon nanomaterials is the increased use in fuel cells. Fuel cells has been widely used because of its high performance and low pollution generation, but the cost of electrodes is high - this is being investigated to reduce the cost of electrodes along with increasing catalytic activity [108, 112]. Carbon nanotubes can also be used in solar cells as energy conversion materials aiding in photo generation sites and charge carriers in the transport and collecting layer [113]. Semiconductor nanocrystal carbon nanotubes composites such as cadmium sulphide carbon nanotubes (CdS/CNT), cadmium selenide carbon nanotubes (CdSe/CNT), titanium dioxide carbon nanotubes (TiO2/CNT) and copper (I) sulphide nanotubes (Cu2S/CNT) have revealed superior performance in solar cells [114]. The high aspect ratio, large surface area, and high conductivity of nanotubes are helpful for alienation and charge carrier transport in composites consequently improving power conversion efficiency [111]. Chemical sensors are widely used in environmental monitoring, chemical process control as well as biomedical and agricultural fields. CNTs have demonstrated high sensitivity towards numerous gases for example, O2, NH3 and NO2. Adsorption of electron withdrawing or bestowing molecules on carbon nanotubes will cause charge exchange either from or to carbon nanotubes, which may bring about unique conductance change of the semiconducting, single walled, carbon nanotubes [115]. This modification in conductance allows the identification of some gases even in low concentration. Molecular detection requires solid assistance amongst sensors and target particles. However, numerous gases, including H2 and CO, are not sensitive to carbon nanotubes. Coating of carbon nanotubes with inorganic nanocrystals has potential for synthetically detecting more molecules [111]. The sensitivity of\na series of metal nanocrystal exaggerated coated carbon nanotubes towards detection of a randomized series of hazardous and flammable gasses such as H2, CH4, CO and H2S illustrates that the effect of the thickness of the deposited metal layer is substantial. The sensitivity of the sensor devices decreases with the increase in metal thickness [116]. Because of the extensive electrochemical coverage, electron exchange is rapid and can be adjusted with a variety of compound molecules and bio-molecules. Inorganic nanocrystals have demonstrated potential in applications for high sensitivity electro-analysis [117]. Carbon nanotubes have benefits of substantial surface, high conductivity, quick bearer exchange speed, great electrochemical movement and quick response speed. Also, carbon nanotubes have wide electrochemical windows; consequently the combination of inorganic nanocrystals and carbon nanotubes incorporates the benefits of the two materials. This provides a synergistic impact between the two materials and results in better electroanalytical execution [117]. Furthermore, nanotubes can also be used for hydrogen storage of such applications as fuel cells or laptop computers. However, experimental studies the claimed high storage volumes are contentious so it is difficult to assess application potential [118, 119]. Carbon nanotubes can also be utilized in resins to boost the mechanical properties of fiber composites [120, 121]. For example, light weight wind turbine blades and hulls for naval ships are made by carbon fibre composites utilizing carbon nanotubes Carbon nanotubes can also be used as an additive in organic originators used to form carbon fibers [122]. Recently research activity on electronic filed has gained attention for using single wall nanotubes and multiwall nanotubes as field emission electron sources [123] such as flat panel displays [124], lamps [125], gas discharge tubes [126], and x-ray and microwave generators [127]. A potential enhancement supplied by a carbon nanotube–coated surface on an anode is the delivery of higher local fields because of the smaller radius of the nanofiber tip and the length of the nanofiber. These local fields cause electrons to transfer from nanotube tip into the vacuum. The electric fields coordinate the field-discharged electrons towards the anode where a phosphor creates light for flat panel application [128].\nCarbon nanotubes can also be used as components for biosensors and medical equipment due to the dimensional and chemical similarity of carbon nanotubes with biomolecules such as DNA and proteins. In addition, carbon nanotubes may be employed for fluorescent [129] and photo-acoustic imaging [130], and for limited warming by utilizing close infrared radiation [131]. The electrical impedance and optical properties of single-walled nanotube biosensors can be varied by adsorption of an object on the carbon nano-\nFig. (6). Comparison of Raman spectroscopy nanomaterial produced (A) bagasse or (B) corn-based residue through catalytic pyrolysis at different temperature [83].\n!\n!\n\"\n#\n$#\n\"\n#\n$#\n%&& '&&& %&& '&&&\n( # ' ( # '\n&%)')&* ) +,- -+% %,+ , % )%-'.++'--,'+..'')')),,&& &%)')&* ) +,- -+% %,+ , % )%-'.++'--,'+..'')')),,&&\ntube surface thus altering the shape of the nanotube [130, 131]. To fulfil the condition of high sensitivity and selectivity requires building the carbon nanotube surface (with, for example, functional groups and coatings) [132] and suitable sensor design [133]. Products under progress incorporate ink-jet–printed test strips for estrogenic and progesterone recognition; microarrays for DNA and protein discovery, and; sensors for NO2 and cardiovascular troponin [134]. Comparative carbon nanotubes sensors have been utilized for gas and poison recognition in the food industry, military, and ecological applications as well [133]."

      "heading" : "5. CRITICAL DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "The thermochemical methods of pyrolysis and HTC are highly efficient that can use a broad range of organic precursors to produce well-ordered carbon nanomaterials. Both pyrolysis and HTC target the carbonization of the organic material by utilising different mechanisms to bring about the disintegration of the organic molecules in either at high temperature, low pressure, inert dry environment, or at a low temperature, high pressure subcritical wet atmosphere thus producing various carbon nanostructures. The pyrolysis method has higher energy requirement in which the thermal disintegration takes place without oxidation reactions. For the case of HTC, this is a more energy efficient process in which the precursor material undergoes a complicated set of reactions such as decarbonylation, decarboxylation, demethoxylation, condensation, dehydration and aromatization that are responsible for breakage of hydrocarbon bonds [135]. Because of these distinct operational conditions the carbon nanostructures synthesised have different physiochemical properties, shapes, sizes and structural composition.\nCarbon nanostructures from pyrolysis at higher temperature were found to be hollow compared to those produced by HTC. However, for HTC hollow nanostructures were formed with higher processing time (greater than 48 hours) as reported by Jia et al. [136]. It was reported that it was only under extreme conditions that the structure became hollow. Another method to produce hollow structures by HTC is by using metal oxides in the treatment. Iron oxides were found to increase the intensity of disintegration of the organic material in HTC that lead to the formation of hollow nanostructures. However in pyrolysis at excess temperature, the use of iron oxide causes the agglomeration of carbon nanostructures which reduces the overall BET area of the produced material. One of the main differences that is found in carbon nanostructures produced by HTC is the higher amount of OFG (oxygenated functional groups) which allows the use of these products in very broad areas compared with products produced by pyrolysis [137]. Pyrolysis is considered to be an efficient method to produce higher BET specific surface areas than HTC however the materials produced by HTC are enriched in OFG therefore higher adsorption capacities were found even with a lower surface area compared to nanomaterials produced by pyrolysis. Also, nanomaterials produced by HTC may exhibit a more efficient adsorption mechanism due to ion exchange as opposed to physical adsorption of pyrolysis products [138]. Catalytic activities play an important role in the production of ultra-fine nanostructures in pyrolysis and HTC techniques. Unique morphologies of less than 10 nm nano-size were reported by the use of both techniques with the assistance of different additives. Low temperature, single-pot HTC processes have shown great potential to form carbon nanomaterial of symmetrical structure using phenolic derivatives as additives.\nCONCLUSION\nNanomaterials are the functional materials which comprise at least one dimension less than 100 nm. Carbon nanomaterials are of great importance because of their extraordinary thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, thus they have a wide range of applications in catalysis, adsorption, stationary phase in liquid chromatography, electrode material, etc. Carbon nanomaterials can be synthesized by any type of hydrocarbon or carbonaceous materials by adopting appropriate conditions. Both pyrolysis and HTC are widely accepted methods for the synthesis of nanostructured materials from biomass resources. For pyrolysis, parameters that affect the formation of carbon nanomaterials include: interaction between carbon sources; process parameters, catalyst type, and precursor. Synthesis of carbon nanomaterials from HTC is more favourable compared to pyrolysis as HTC does not need a strong acid solvent or any reagent for surface passivation. Thus, it is a sustainable, scalable and very cost effective method. The conversion of waste biomass into useful material via pyrolysis and HTC is a breakthrough for the future production of nanocarbon materials.\nCONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\nNot applicable.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest, financial or otherwise."
