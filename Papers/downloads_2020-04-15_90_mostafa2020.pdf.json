Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) doped Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) film has been synthesized via one-potential pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) technique. The structural, optical, and morphological studies of the synthesized PVA/AgNPs nanocomposite film have been characterized by different techniques such as; XRD, FT-IR, UVeVis, PL, FE-SEM, and EDAX. From X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), it is approved that the synthesized PVA/AgNPs film is polycrystalline with cubic structure form. From UVeVisible spectroscopy, the energy band gap was determined by using tauc relation, which was found to be 3.7eV for direct transition. From morphological study, FE-SEM photos of the synthesized PVA/AgNPs film show the homogeneous distributed spherical-like shape of silver nanoparticles in PVA. The qualitative and semi-quantitative elemental analysis of the prepared samples via EDAX technique confirmed the embedding of the silver nanoparticles in the PVA structure. The amazing performance of the prepared PVA/AgNPs film in catalytic degradation activity for 4-nitrophenol reduction has been investigated, which lead to degrade 93% of 4-nitrrophenol in 25 min.\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

      "text" : "The massive release of dangerous substances into the atmosphere is rising with the development of industrialization. Dangerous contaminants comprising industrial nitro-compounds are noteworthy for their harmful and cancerous nature. Among these, organic nitrophenols, in particular, are the main contaminants of agricultural and industrial wastewater owing to their stability and solubility water. This makes water purification one of the most important aspects of the modern international trend for environmental health [1e4].\nSeveral investigators are therefore assigned to establish environmentally sound and efficient strategies for extracting these toxins from industrial wastewater. Several processes have been regulated to extracting nitroaromatics such as; hydrogenation reactions, photo-catalytic degradation, electrochemical techniques, and catalytic moist air oxidation [5e9].\nPhysics Division, National\n@nrc.sci.eg (A.A. Menazea).\nResearch indicates that the size of metal nanoparticles depends on characteristics that make them suitable for catalytic, antibacterial and optical usage. The catalytic activity of nanoparticles is heavily dependent on the surface area. Smaller nanoparticles exhibit predominant catalytic activities due to the higher surfaceto-volume ratio they possess. Moreover, the use of nanoparticles for catalytic degradation has serious consequences because they are very difficult to extract.\nAs a result, thin films, fibers, and sheets are presently being tested for catalytic pollutant degradation. Especially, silver nanoparticles are considered one of the high important nanoparticles that have received huge attention related to their interesting chemical, physical, electrical, biochemical, optical, magnetic and catalytic properties. It is proved to have colossal applications in the fields of catalysis, antimicrobial, electronics, non-linear optics, and biomaterial applications [10,11].\nPolymers have drawn tremendous interest in the manufacture of devices according to their extraordinary internal characteristics such as ease of manufacturing, durability and high mechanical efficiency [1,12e15]. Micro-polymers from nanomaterials have been greatly appreciated by the expanded application target provided by these hybrid materials. Thus, various studies were discussed in the\nrecent literature study focused on the synthesis of different metal nanoparticles doped polymers, with exhaustive capability in their optical and morphological structure to be applied in many fields owing to the implementation from both metal nanoparticles and inorganic polymer matrix [15e17].\nThe use of PVA as a great host polymer for metal nanoparticles is advantageous because of its amazing chemical resistance water solubility, and biodegradability with outstanding chemical and physical characteristics. There are many methods that can be used to handle nanocomposite metal oxides/PVA as a chemical process [18,19]. There is also another strategy that has arisen and expanded exponentially since the end during the last century because of green properties. The production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by pulsed laser ablation of solids in air and liquids was regarded as an efficient route with substantial strengths over other routes [20,21].\nOn the other hand, pulsed laser ablation in liquid media technique (PLAL) is considering a modern approach in the field of nanofabrication; it has currently attracted a lot of attention due to the ability to synthesize nanomaterials as an eco-friendly, fast, lowcost, and simple method used extensively to manufacture silver nanoparticles [6,18,22e26]. This technique involves ablating the metal target plate that immersed in solution by Nd:YAG nanosecond laser pulses to disperse the metal nanoparticles into the solution [27e31].\nHenceforth, in this perspective, the novelty of this study appeared on present fabrication a smart material from PVA/AgNPs in the form of the nanostructured composite film prepared via a one-step nanosecond laser ablation process as an eco-friendly nano-catalyst sheet for 4-nitrophenol degradation. The structural and optical studies of the synthesized PVA/AgNPs nanocomposite film have been characterized by different techniques such as; XRD, FT-IR, UVeVis, PL, FE-SEM, and EDAX. Also, this study discusses the amazing performance of the prepared PVA/AgNPs film in catalytic degradation activity in 4-nitrophenol reduction."

From this figure, in the case of preparation film fromPVAwithout embedding, it cleared that there are three main diffraction peaks at 2q equaled 19.55о, 23.19о, and 42.22о, whichwas corresponded to the following\nindices planes (110), (200), and (220), respectively, based on the lattice values in the previous literature work (JCPDS card No. 65e2870) [36,37]. According to these diffraction peaks and JCPDS card No., the prepared PVA without embedding was crystallinity hexagonal phase structure and did not have any other impurities, while in the case of embedding with Ag NPs, there were a new diffraction peaks were appeared with the diffraction peak of the PVA structure. That was confirmed that the crystallinity structure of the PVA chain matrix did not affected by using pulsed laser ablation process, but the area under the curve of the diffraction peaks related to PVA chain matrix was decreased due the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bond between PVA chain matrix and Ag metal, which affected on the area under the curve of the PVA characteristic peak, followed by decreasing their intensity [38]. By looking on the diffraction angle values of the new peaks which appeared after embedding with Ag metal via pulsed laser ablation process, there were four diffraction peaks appeared at 2q equaled 38.02 , 44 , 65 , and 78 , which was corresponded to the following indices planes (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively, based on the lattice values in the previous literature work (JCPDS card No. 53e1847) [39e41]. According to these diffraction peaks and JCPDS card No., the prepared PVA matrix chain was embedded with Ag nanostructured materials with the cubic (FCC) phase structure. According to this finding and the information of the numbers of JCPD cards, it was concluded that pulsed laser ablation process of Ag metal immersed in PVA solution leads to formation PVA/Ag nanocomposite structure from PVA as a chain matrix and embedding materials from Ag nanostructured material. Furthermore, based on the information that could be used from Scherer’s formula [42,43], which could be applied in the most intense peak corresponding to the plane of (111). The average crystallinity size could be determined by using the following equation, Dzl=b cos q, where l is the wavelength of the Cu Ka X-ray, b is diffraction broadening line in radian [44e47]. The calculated crystallite size is 17 nm for the strongest peak corresponding to the plane of (1 1 1). XRD patterns clearly exemplify the nano-crystalline existence of synthesized silver thin films."

      "text" : "The effect of pulsed laser ablation of silver metal immersed in PVA solution could be primarily detected by naked eyes. Fig. 3a shows the UVeVisible absorption spectra of pure PVA with and without embedding AgNPs produced via pulsed laser ablation of silver in the PVA solution. For pure PVA film without embedding with AgNPs, there are no absorption peak could be detected, while pure PVA embedding with Ag NPs, there was an obvious significant absorption peak at 430 nm assigned to the SPR effect, confirming the presence of AgNPs in PVA chainmatrix. The optical energy band gap ðEgÞ for the prepared PVA chain matrix film with and without embedding AgNPs could be calculated by using the Tauc’s relation [48,49], which expressed by using this formula, ahy ¼ Aðhy EgÞn, Where a is the absorbance coefficient, A is the film constant based on its thickness, hy is the photon energy, and Eg is the optical energy band gap. From this equation, by drawing the relation between ðahnÞ1 =\n2verses (hn) the direct energy band gap can be measured by clouted the slope of the intercept line as mentioned in Fig. 3b, which was found that the energy band gap decreased from 4 eV in case of pure PVA film to 3.7 eV in case of PVA/Ag nanocomposite. The narrow energy bandgap in the case of presence of AgNPs was related to effect of the chemical bond which formed between PVA chain matrix and AgNPs generated the localization states phenomena between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital’s, which effect on increase the number of Ag\natoms, followed by decreasing the energy band gap in the case of embedding with Ag NPs [50].\nPhotoluminescence analysis was conducted to obtain more details about the energy band gap for the PVA and PVA/AgNPs nanocomposites films as shown in Fig. 3b. From this figure, it cleared that the PVA chain matrix film with and without embedding had an emission peak at 408 nm, but in the different value of intensity [51]. That decreasing in the value of intensity was related to the self-absorption that happened in the chain matrix film between PVA structure and AgNPs. Based onMooradianet et al., When the photo was as absorbed by AgNPs, it is absorbed by the outer levels, which was in case of Ag is d-orbital’s. So, the upper level in the d-orbital started to make inter-band transition to the upper electronic state in the conduction band. At this time, the number of holes and electrons was created in the valence band and conduction band, which was relaxed via scattering with phonon and recombined again to produce luminescence [52,53], but in our case Ag element is a nanoscale form. So, the number of atoms produced in the cluster between high occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital’s was increased, followed by the space between these molecular orbital’s became very small. So, the photoluminescence intensity decreases in the case of embedding with Ag NPs [54,55].\nThe FT-IR spectroscopic technique was used to inform the vibration motion caused by the functional groups that consisting the molecular structure of the synthesized PVA structure with and\nwithout embedding by AgNPs by pulsed laser ablation of Ag plate immersed in the PVA solution as obtained in Fig. 3c. For pure PVA film without embedding with AgNPs, the spectrum obtained that there was a broad vibration peak appeared at the region between 2990 cm 1 and 3588 cm 1 related to the hydroxyl functional group (OeH stretching) [56]. Moreover, there is a vibration appeared at 1095 cm 1 are related to CeO the stretching vibration in PVA chain [57,58]. Besides, there is out-of-planes vibration mode of the OeH appeared at 638 cm 1 [59]. Furthermore, there is an important vibration peak was appeared at 1657 cm 1 related to the functional group of (C]O stretching vibration) [60e64], while in the case of embedding of PVA chain matrix with Ag NPs. There are shift of the stretching carbonyl group to 1668 cm 1 [65]."

From this figure, it cleared that the collected images of the PVA chain matrix embedding with AgNPs showed bright depicting spherical-like shape of silver nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface PVA chain matrix, which was completely different when compare with collected image of the\npure PVA chain matrix structure. The semi-qualitative and semiquantitative elemental analysis could be carried by EDX technique as shown in Fig. 5. The EDX was used to know the elemental composition andmake sure the quality of purity of the sample [66]. From these spectra, it cleared that the pure PVA film without embedding by AgNPs showed signals for C and O (38.12% &61.88% in weight %) which are due to the presence of just PVA structure, while the PVA chain with embedding by Ag NPs showed signals for C, O, and Ag (29.11%, 43.75, and 27.14% in weight %)."

By looking on the UVevisible spectrum of 4- nitrophenol, there is a significant absorption peak appeared at 317 nm, which was disappeared completely and appeared a new peak at 400 nm, when add NaBH4 due to formation of 4- nitrophenolate ions. The main target in this step is overcome the 4-nitrophenolate ions by diminishing gradually the absorption peak characterized 4-nitrophenol and convert to 4-aminophenol by appearing the absorption peak characterized 4-aminohpenol as soon as possible, which was characterized at 300 nm. As this process takes a lot of time, the performance of PVA/Ag nanocomposite\nfilm as a catalytic degradation material was studied by inserting in 4-nitrophenol solution to complete the following journey, once the nanostructured materials is presence, 4-nitrophenol was adsorbed on the nanostructured materials’ surface based on their high surface to volume surface. After that, BH4 donated the electrons towards the nano-structured materials [5,7,67e70]. At this time 4- nitrophenol attracted these electrons and it was ready to be desorbed by nanostructured materials, followed by completing reduction process to form 4-aminophenol. Fig. 5a showed the timedependent of reduction 4-nitrophenolate ion to 4-aminophenol after adding PVA/AgNPs nanocomposite film. This study showed that the efficiency of PVA/AgNPs nanocomposite film for doing this target (as mentioned in Fig. 5b) reached 93% in 25 min based on study Ct=C verses reaction time, where Ct is the concentration of 4- nitrophenolate at any time and at initial reaction time, respectively. Furthermore, based on the concentration of NaBH4 is higher than that of 4-nitrophenol, this reaction of reduction process could be considered as pseudo 1st order reaction with respect to 4- nitrphenol. This type of reaction was expressed as lnCt= C ¼ kt, where k is the rate constant of the pseudo 1st order of reaction and t is the reaction of time. By studying this relation, the average rate constant of the pseudo 1st order of reaction exceeded 0.102 min 1."

    "abstractText" : "This work attempts to introduce an eco-friendly nano-catalyst PVA/AgNPs portable film for 4nitrophenol degradation. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) doped Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) film has been synthesized via one-potential pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) technique. The structural, optical, and morphological studies of the synthesized PVA/AgNPs nanocomposite film have been characterized by different techniques such as; XRD, FT-IR, UVeVis, PL, FE-SEM, and EDAX. From X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), it is approved that the synthesized PVA/AgNPs film is polycrystalline with cubic structure form. From UVeVisible spectroscopy, the energy band gap was determined by using tauc relation, which was found to be 3.7eV for direct transition. From morphological study, FE-SEM photos of the synthesized PVA/AgNPs film show the homogeneous distributed spherical-like shape of silver nanoparticles in PVA. The qualitative and semi-quantitative elemental analysis of the prepared samples via EDAX technique confirmed the embedding of the silver nanoparticles in the PVA structure. The amazing performance of the prepared PVA/AgNPs film in catalytic degradation activity for 4-nitrophenol reduction has been investigated, which lead to degrade 93% of 4-nitrrophenol in 25 min. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
