      "text" : "Hazardous organic materials (carbon based compounds: e.g. methyl orange, rhodamine B, phenol, bisphenol, methylene blue, etc.) are important sources of wastewater contamination. They can be removed in wastewater contamination by the photocatalytic method of semiconductor hybrid nanophotocatalysts (e.g. CuWO4/NiO, SmVO4,\nTiO2–graphene–ZnFe2−xTbxO4, SrTiO3, NiTiO3, CdTiO3, CeVO4, Nd2TiO5, Yb2(MoO4)3/YbMoO4, BaFe12O19/ Sm2Ti2O7/Ag, Pr3+ ions in cobalt–nickel ferrite, etc.) [1–10]. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in the photocatalytic degradation of hazardous organic materials under UV-light (λ < 387 nm). Thus, effective utilization of UV-light is a common way for photocatalytic degradation of hazardous organic pollutants [11–13].\n* Ali Sobhani-Nasab Ali.sobhaninasab@gmail.com\n* Mehdi Rahimi-Nasrabadi Rahiminasrabadi@gmail.com\n1 Students’ Scientific Research Center (SSRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran\n2 Molecular Biology Research Center, Systems Biology and Poisoning Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n3 Faculty of Pharmacy, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n4 Young Researchers and Elite Club, Islamic Azad University, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran\n5 Social Determinants of Health (SDH) Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran\n6 Core Research Lab, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran\n7 Department of Physics, University of Kashan, Kashan, Iran 8 Center of Excellence in Electrochemistry, School\nof Chemistry, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran\n9 Biosensor Research Centre, Endocrinology & Metabolism Molecular and Cellular Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n1 3\nSpinel-phase nanocrystalline Li0.5−0.5xMxFe2.5−0.5xO4 (e.g. M = Mg2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, etc.) magnetic ferrites constitute a key family of nanomaterials which are suitable for a range of applications like nanoferro fluids, nano-biomedical, nano-photocatalysts, magnetic, microwave, and gas sensing devices [14, 15].\nBecause Li0.5Fe2.5O4 enjoys qualities such as having low dielectric loss, high saturation magnetization, square hysteresis loop, low cost and environmental friendliness, and being non-toxicity, it could be considered as a potential magnetic material for hybrid nanophotocatalysts [16]. The varied qualities of spinel lithium ferrites can be attributed to their ability to host the cations for a range of transition metals in their lattice. Therefore, their structural, optical, magnetic and electrical characteristics can change. New approaches, like radiofrequency inductively coupled plasma (RF-ICP), chemical hydrothermal, electrochemical, microwave or sonochemical processing, inert gas condensation, sol–gel auto-combustion, and mechanical milling have been introduced for preparing spinel ferrite nanoparticles [17–20]. A very common choice from this list has been the sol–gel auto-combustion (SGAC) approach which has been used in the synthesis of materials with different metastable structures, even at rather low temperatures, because this method yields products with great chemical homogeneity. Such method offers the possibility to manipulate physical characteristics such as particle size and shape, and pore structure in the product by varying the preparation conditions [21, 22].\nOn the other hand, the contemporary state of exposure to nanomaterials has attracted a great deal of attention to the evaluation of their antibacterial and nanotoxicology, and the incremental trends in the application of nanoparticles [23–25]. They increase the need for more techniques for their evaluation and analysis. It is also important to pinpoint and describe the physicochemical properties of the particles which affect their toxicity and use this information for obtaining desirable products. Herein, we report the synthesis of the Ni or Mg-doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4 nano-crystalline magnetic ferrites using the sol–gel auto-combustion process for in vitro cytotoxicity assay and catalytic photo degradation of aqueous solution of MO under ultraviolet light irradiation."

LiNO3, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O were used as precursors to prepare Li0.5Fe2.5O4, LiMg0.5Fe2O4 and LiNi0.5Fe2O4 magnetic nanophotocatalysts. The metal nitrate/citric acid monohydrate molar ratio was kept at 1:3 at room temperature. Typical preparation procedures involved dissolving LiNO3, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, citric acid and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O or Mg(NO3)2·6H2O in 100 mL of DI, with stirring 3000 rpm for 3 h to form a stable solution at normal temperature. Next liquid ammonium hydroxide was added to the solution in a drop wise manner to pH of 7 while the solution was heated at 80 °C for 60 min, to yield a transparent sol. This was heated for another 60 min at 110 °C to evaporate the water. Further increase in the temperature turned the sol to a viscous brown gel, and eventually dried gel at 100 °C for 60 min. When a certain temperature was reached, the sample ignited and the dried gel burnt to form the magnesium or nickel-substituted lithium ferrite powder. This powder was next dried and sintered for 120 min at 900 °C in a muffle furnace."

All samples showed the near-band-edge (NBE) bands characteristic of Li0.5Fe2.5O4 and magnesium- or nickel doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4 at about 565, 533 and 545 nm. Moreover, a wider emission was observed in all cases. This was attributed to the recombination of photogenerated holes with electrons\nwhich were deeply trapped in oxygen vacancies [42]. Doping was found to decrease the overall intensity of the peaks of both samples, due to the emergence of electronic levels with energies between those of the conduction and valence bands as a result of increased defects [43]. Hence the charge separation efficiency and photocatalytic activity are expected to have an inverse relationship of LiMg0.5Fe2O4 > LiNi0.5Fe2O4 > Li0.5Fe2.5O4 [44]."

The removal of MO dye by Mg or Ni-doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4, were higher as opposed to Li0.5Fe2.5O4. The p–d spin exchange interaction between the localized f electrons of\nNi or Mg doped into Li0.5Fe2.5O4 surrounding and the band electrons leads to narrowing. Meanwhile, pedex-change and the sed interactions give rise to a positive and a negative correction to the valence band energies and the conduction band, respectively. They happen due to reduce in band gap energy. Therefore different parameters such as strain, lattice distortion and impurity change its band gap value.\nEffect of irradiation time and kinetic studies on the photodegradation MO dye in the presence of the Li0.5Fe2.5O4, LiMg0.5Fe2O4 and LiNi0.5Fe2O4 magnetic nanophotocatalyst samples are illustrated in Fig. 8. Photocatalytic reactions involving the application of magnetic nano-photocatalysts fit the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model [46]. In the present case the reaction involving the magnetic nanophotocatalyst samples and UV irradiation is a pseudo 1st order reaction. The kinetics of such reactions are expressed by:\nIntegrating this equation from C = C0 at t = 0 (C0 is the initial bulk concentration of MO and t: reaction time) yields:\nk is the apparent rate constant, C0 is the bulk concentration of MO before the reaction, and C is the MO concentration at any instant t after the onset of the irradiation.\nToday, considering the excellent performance of different nanomaterials in photocatalyst, many scientists have focused on this field [35, 47–53]. Figure 9a, b shows the performance of magnetic nanophotocatalyst samples towards MO degradation under UV irradiation. In comparison with un doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4, Mg or Ni-doping improves the photoactivity of Li0.5Fe2.5O4, principally because Mg2+ and Ni2+ can act as both electron–hole (e−–h+) traps to enhance lifetimes of e−–h+ pairs [44]. The magnetic Mg-doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4 nanophotocatalysts had outstanding photocatalytic activity for the UV induced degradation of MO at λ < 387 nm. The first event after the irradiation of the reaction dispersion containing Ni or Mg-doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4 includes the formation of e−–h+ pairs, which oxidizes MO. MO may also be oxidized by reactive oxygen species active sites such as OH· and O2·− radicals formed on the illuminated Ni or Mg-doped Li0.5Fe2.5O4 surface [54].\n(3)r = dc∕dt = −kC\n(4)ln ( C∕C0 ) = −kt\nTable 2 Optical and crystal size parameters of the nanophotocatalysts samples Sample no.

The products were studied by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and vibrating sample magnetometery (VSM). XRD results showed that the nano-photocatalytic samples lithium ferrite (Li0.5Fe2.5O4), lithium-magnesium ferrite (LiMg0.5Fe2O4) and lithium-nickel ferrite (LiNi0.5Fe2O4) are nano-photocatalytic samples, which are in good crystalline form. The LiMg0.5Fe2O4 nano-photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic performance for removal of methyl orange (MO) and removed 99.9% of pollutant within 25 min under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. Magnetic characterization revealed that the Mr and Ms of LiNi0.5Fe2O4 nano-photocatalyst decreases with doping Ni or Mg. Finally, in vitro cytotoxic effect of synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated on Hela cell line.",
