    "abstractText" : "Point defects can have signi cant impact on the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of materials. The development of robust, multidimensional, high-throughput, and large-scale characterization techniques of defects is thus crucial for the establishment of integrated nanophotonic technologies and material growth optimization. Here, we demonstrate the potential of wideeld spectral single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) for the determination of ensemble spectral properties as well as the characterization of spatial, spectral, and temporal dynamics of single defects in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown and irradiated exfoliated hexagonal boron-nitride materials. We characterize the heterogeneous spectral response of our samples and identify at least two types of defects in CVD-grown materials, while irradiated exfoliated akes show predominantly only one type of defects. We analyze the blinking kinetics and spectral emission for each type of defects and discuss their implications with respect to the observed spectral heterogeneity of our samples. Our study shows the potential of wideeld spectral SMLM techniques in material science and paves the way toward the quantitative multidimensional mapping of defect properties.",
