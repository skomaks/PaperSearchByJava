Current clinical cancer treatments are unsatisfactory in terms of both antitumor efficacy and biocompatibility. Meanwhile, nanomaterials attract much attention as potential treatment strategies with improved antitumor efficacy and reduced side effects. Selenium-containing nanomaterials are considered to be a promising biomaterial candidate among many different approaches during the last decade. Selenium-containing nanomaterials exhibit good biocompatibility since selenium is an essential trace element in human body. With rational design, selenium-containing nanomaterials show high sensitivity to redox stimuli and anticancer activity. Here, we discuss the development of selenium-containing nanomaterials as drug delivery carriers and anticancer drugs for cancer treatment.

      "heading" : "INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Cancer remains one of the major public health problems and the second leading cause of death worldwide. There have been an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.6 million cancer deaths every year globally. In 2020, the global cancer market is poised to reach $150 billion.1–3 Over 100 types of cancers have been identified throughout the whole human body, severely threatening the health of people. Therefore, efficient cancer treatments are always in great demand to alleviate the global cancer burden.4–6\nCurrent cancer treatments mainly include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, these treatments often lack selectivity and cause toxicity to healthy tissues,7–11 and call for the development of nanomaterials to reduce side effects and boost anticancer activities. Nanomaterials are nanosized materials with diameters up to hundreds of nanometers, including liposomes,12–14 polymeric micelles,15–19 and organic or inorganic nanoparticles (NPs).20–23 They can either carry multiple drugs or act as anticancer drugs on their own. Compared with traditional small molecular chemotherapeutic drugs, nanomaterials have better solubility and stability. They can also target tumor tissues via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect or through the modification of targeting ligands.24 These advantages endow nanomaterials with higher therapeutic efficacy as well as lower side effects.\nAmong nanomaterials, selenium-containing nanomaterials have emerged as a rising star for cancer treatment based on the unique properties of selenium. Selenium was first discovered by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1817.25 It is a semimetallic element in the same group of the periodic table as oxygen and sulfur. However, it shows specific physical and chemical properties owing to its atomic radius and electronegativity.\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 ª 2020 The Authors. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\n1\nCompared with sulfur, the selenium atom is larger and has lower electronegativity, which makes it easier for selenium in a low valence to be oxidized. The bond energies of C–Se and Se–Se are 244 and 172 kJ/mol, respectively, which are even lower than those of C–S and S–S (272 and 240 kJ/mol), endowing selenium-containing compounds with high sensitivity to environmental changes.26 In addition, selenium was recognized in 1957 as a necessary element of the human body. It was revealed later that selenium is incorporated into various enzymes and acts as the active center of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO).27 In this way, selenium possesses the ability to regulate the redox balance in the human body. Some selenium-containing compounds have already been reported to show a therapeutic effect on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.28 However, there is still no selenium-containing anticancer drug in clinical applications. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in selenium-containing nanomaterials for cancer treatment. The roles of selenium are discussed as drug carriers for controlled release and active centers for anticancer drugs. It is expected that selenium-containing nanomaterials with good in vitro and in vivo performances can be pushed forward to clinical applications."

      "text" : "As drug carriers for cancer treatment, materials need to have high biocompatibility and stability in physiological conditions. Selenium-containing nanomaterials were previously excluded from consideration because they were regarded as toxic and unstable. In 2010, when Ma et al.29 reported a method to synthesize stable selenium-containing polymers with low toxicity, selenium-containing nanomaterials started to be considered potential biomaterials for drug delivery. Although some selenium-containing compounds are considered toxic to the human body, their toxicities are dose dependent. The recommended daily intake of selenium is 50 mg for adults. Selenium intake below this level is generally nontoxic. Since selenium-containing nanomaterials normally contain a low mass ratio of selenium, and the enhanced stability and bioavailability of nanomaterials improve their targeting efficiency, the amounts of selenium intake are always below the limit. In this regard, selenium-containing nanomaterials can exhibit promising biosafety for cancer treatment. In the past decade, various selenium-containing nanomaterials were developed and applied as drug carriers for cancer treatment. Taking advantage of the high sensitivity to stimuli such as redox, light, and radiation, selenium-containing nanomaterials play important roles in the development of smart drug carriers with controlled release features."

      "heading" : "DISELENIDE-CONTAINING NANOMATERIALS",
      "text" : "The diselenide bond is a dynamic covalent bond with a low bond energy of 172 kJ/ mol. It was reported to be highly sensitive to both oxidative and reductive stimuli. Upon oxidation, the diselenide bond can be oxidized to seleninic acid or selenonic acid. Upon reduction, it can be reduced to selenol. Both stimuli result in the cleavage of the diselenide bond, making diselenide nanomaterials promising candidates for redox-responsive drug carriers. Ma et al.29 first reported the synthesis of a dual responsive diselenide-containing block copolymer in 2010 (Figure 1). Their study proposed a strategy to incorporate selenium into nanomaterials with high stability and biocompatibility, which opened a new avenue for selenium-containing nanomaterials as drug carriers. The diselenide-containing polymer called PEG-PUSeSe-PEG had amphiphilicity and could self-assemble into spherical micelles with an average diameter of 76 nm. Under mild redox stimuli of 0.01% H2O2 (v/v) or 0.03 mM\n2 Cell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020\nFigure reprinted with permission from Ma et al.29 Copyright 2010 the American Chemical Society.\nGSH, the polymer disassembled due to the cleavage of the diselenide bonds. Small molecular anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded into the micelles and released into cancer cells under redox stimuli. Since the redox conditions are different between intracellular and extracellular environments and also notably different between cancer cells and normal cells, the diselenide nanomaterials with dual redox responsiveness are expected to be promising biomaterials for anticancer drug delivery.\nMore diselenide nanomaterials were developed recently, such as micelles, hydrogels, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Making use of their high sensitivity to oxidative,30 reductive,31–34 or both conditions,35–40 smart drug carriers were successfully designed with controlled release properties. Diselenide bridged mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs) with dual responsiveness were also reported (Figure 2).41 Diselenide-bond-containing organosilica moieties were incorporated into the silica framework to fabricate the dual responsive MSNs. Cytotoxic RNase A was then encapsulated into the internal pores of MSNs through electrostatic interactions. Upon exposure to oxidative or reductive conditions, the MSN frameworks degraded owing to the cleavage of diselenide bonds, and the RNase A was consequently released. The surface of the MSNs was further cloaked with cancer cell-derived membrane fragments for increasing blood circulation time and enhancing tumor accumulation efficiency. This study41 provided a new strategy to fabricate redox responsive drug delivery systems for biomacromolecule therapeutics.\nDynamic covalent property of diselenide bonds was also used to fabricate drug carriers with dual responsiveness. Diselenide bonds are dynamic covalent bonds with low bond energy. They were reported to undergo dynamic exchange reaction under visible light.42 Making use of the light-induced dynamic exchange reaction of diselenide bonds, Zhai et al.43 developed diselenide-rich polymeric NPs from PEG-bPBSe diblock copolymers (Figure 3). DOX and camptothecin (CPT) were encapsulated into amphiphilic PEG-b-PBSe diblock copolymers with diselenide bonds in the side chains. Upon exposure to visible light, the metathesis of diselenide bonds\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 3\nFigure reprinted with permission from Shao et al.41 Copyright 2018 Wiley-VCH.\nresulted in the crosslinking among different polymer chains, which significantly improved the stability of drug carriers. The NPs exhibited extended blood circulation time and minimal drug leakage. Meanwhile, they could undergo fast disassembly at tumor tissues under redox stimuli, leading to the targeted release of DOX and CPT.\nMaking use of the oxidation-responsive properties of diselenides, light-responsive drug delivery systems can also be developed based on the diselenide bond. Chromophores such as porphyrin derivatives can produce singlet oxygen upon exposure to red light. Based on this concept, porphyrin was combined into the diselenide micelles PEG-PUSeSe-PEG to form a red light-responsive drug carrier.44,45 In addition, near-infrared light (NIR)-responsive diselenide nanocarriers were fabricated by combining them with upconversion NPs (UCNPs) and the photosensitizer rose bengal (RB).46 Under irradiation at 808 nm, UCNPs generated emissions of 540 nm, which activated RB to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the cleavage of diselenide bonds and the collapse of the whole NP.\ng-Radiation is an ionizing radiation that has been widely applied as radiotherapy in clinical cancer treatment. Exposure to g-radiation also leads to ROS generation, which can cleave diselenide bonds. A g-radiation-responsive hydrogel was developed by complexation between a positively charged diselenide polymer and a negatively charged peptide amphiphile.47 Exposed to 0.5 kGy g-radiation, the diselenide bonds on the backbone of the hydrogel were cleaved, resulting in the disruption of long fibers into short fragments. Encapsulated anticancer drugs would consequently be released. However, the dosage of g-radiation in clinical applications is lower than 0.5 kGy. More sensitive nanomaterials were developed with\n4 Cell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020\nFigure reprinted with permission from Zhai et al.43 Copyright 2017 Elsevier.\ndiselenide-containing amphiphilic triblock copolymer PEG-PUSeSe-PEG.48 PEGPUSeSe-PEG could self-assemble into spherical micelles and encapsulate DOX. Under exposure to mild g-radiation of 5 Gy, the micelles disassembled and DOX was released. Compared with the hydrogels, the micelles showed higher sensitivity to g-radiation. The dense networks of hydrogels restrict the diffusion of ROS, which is necessary for g-radiation-induced diselenide bond cleavage."

      "text" : "Monoselenide is not sensitive to reductive conditions, but it is still sensitive to oxidative conditions. It can be oxidized to selenoxide or selenone with higher hydrophilicity. Therefore, the self-assembly behaviors of monoselenide-containing nanomaterials can be tuned by oxidation stimuli. Monoselenide-containing polymer PEG-PUSe-PEG was synthesized with high sensitivity to oxidation stimuli.49,50 PEGPUSe-PEG is an amphiphilic triblock copolymer with hydrophobic monoselenide\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 5\nFigure reprinted with permission from Wang et al.51 Copyright 2017 the American Chemical Society.\npolyurethane blocks and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) blocks. Anticancer drugs such as DOX can be loaded into the polymer and form spherical micelles. Upon exposure to 0.1% H2O2 (v/v), the monoselenide was oxidized to selenoxide and selenone with higher hydrophilicity, which led to the disassembly of the micelles and the release of encapsulated DOX. NIR light-responsive monoselenide-containing polymers were also reported for the highly efficient cytoplasmic delivery of anticancer drugs (Figure 4).51 To achieve NIR light responsiveness, the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was co-loaded with DOX into monoselenide polymers. Under NIR light irradiation, ICG produced large amounts of ROS, which oxidizedmonoselenide and led to the disassembly of the NPs. Based on the oxidation responsiveness of monoselenide, different types of NPs were fabricated as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery.52–54\nDifferent from that of diselenide, the oxidation of monoselenide does not lead to bond cleavage of the Se–C bond. The oxidizing product selenoxide or selenone can be reduced back to monoselenide under reductive conditions, which endows\n6 Cell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020\nmonoselenide nanomaterials with reversible responsiveness to oxidation and reduction stimuli. Monoselenide-containing poly(ethylene oxide-b-acrylic acid) was developed with reversible responsiveness.55 The polymeric micelles can disassemble under oxidative conditions and re-assemble under reductive conditions. The transition can be repeated >7 times. Monoselenide-containing peptides were designed with the propensity to self-assemble.56 In reductive conditions, the peptides self-assembled into nanofibers and formed hydrogels. Upon exposure to oxidation stimuli, the hydrogel would collapse into spherical micelles. Histidine that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetate was attached to the peptide. The catalytic activity was controlled by the sol-gel transition process, which can be carried out >10 times. The reversible redox-responsive monoselenide nanomaterials can be useful for the controlled release of anticancer drugs in ROS-rich cancer cells.\nIn addition, coordinatedmonoselenide-containing nanomaterials can be responsive to some biomolecules with competitive coordination ability in cancer cells, such as GSH and spermine. Selenium can form a coordination bond with different metals. Cao et al.57 reported a coordination-responsive drug delivery system based on coordination between selenium and platinum. DOX was encapsulated into the selenium-platinum coordination polymers. The resulting polymers can self-assemble into micelles with good solubility and stability. However, GSH can competitively coordinate with platinum by replacing the position of selenium-containing ligands. In the presence of GSH, platinum ions were released from the polymers, which led to the disassembly of the micelles. The encapsulated DOX was consequently released. Considering that the concentration of GSH in cytoplasm is much higher than that outside cancer cells, the GSH-responsive drug delivery system exhibits great potential for cancer treatment."

      "text" : "In the past decade, selenium-containing nanomaterials attracted much more attention in the area of cancer therapy. Besides their use as anticancer drug carriers, they also showed anticancer activities based on the unique biological properties of selenium. In the form of selenocysteine, selenium incorporates into many selenoproteins and exerts the ability to regulate the redox balance of the human body. Selenium shows antioxidant properties at low nutritional levels. However, it will turn into a pro-oxidant at elevated doses, which induces the production of ROS. Compared with healthy cells, cancer cells are generally characterized by higher levels of both ROS and reducing agents, due to the accelerated glycolysis and pentose phosphate cycle.58 The high innate ROS concentration makes them more vulnerable to additional ROS production. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that cancer cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress. Therefore, selenium-containing nanomaterials with ROS induction properties can be raised as promising anticancer agents."

      "text" : "The anticancer activity of a diselenide-containing hyperbranched polymer was reported by Liu et al.59 and Li et al.60 The hyperbranched polymer contained diselenide bonds and phosphate ester bonds in the backbone. It could act as a redoxresponsive drug carrier that encapsulated hydrophobic anticancer drugs. In addition to its redox responsiveness, the diselenide-containing polymer exhibited antiproliferation properties against different kinds of cancer cells. Similar to the diselenidecontaining hyperbranched polymer, a monoselenide-containing hyperbranched\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 7\nFigure reprinted with permission from Zeng et al.65 Copyright 2014 Wiley-VCH.\npolymer showed anticancer activity without encapsulating any anticancer drug.61 It inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis.\nCombined with their roles of drug carriers, a selenium-based platform of combination therapy can be developed for cancer treatment. Recently, more diselenide-containing nanomaterials were developed with both drug carrier properties and anticancer activity. Zhang et al.62 reported a diselenide-containing small molecule that self-assembled into spherical assemblies together with paclitaxel. The diselenide-containing assemblies induced cell apoptosis by ROS generation. They also acted as redox-responsive drug carriers for paclitaxel delivery. Fu et al.63 developed diselenide-containing ultrathin polymeric nanocapsules composed of lateral crosslinked pillararenes, which exhibited combined the anticancer effects of selenium and DOX. In addition, the anticancer activity of selenadiazole-containing polyethyleneimines was reported, which induced the apoptosis of bladder cancer cells via ROS production.64\nSelenium-containing coordination complexes were also reported to show anticancer activities. A monoselenide-containing amphiphilic molecule, EGSe, was developed, which could self-assemble into nano-assemblies. After coordinating with platinum, the resultant selenium-platinum coordination assemblies exhibited selective anticancer activity (Figure 5).65,66 The coordination assemblies demonstrated high toxicity to cancer cells but low toxicity to normal cells. In contrast, clinically applied anticancer drugs such as cisplatin are indiscriminately toxic to both cancer cells and normal cells. Therefore, the selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells comes from selenium. Mechanistic studies suggest that the coordination assemblies induce a high level of ROS by consuming GSH in cancer cells.67 Because cancer cells are more vulnerable to additional ROS production, the coordination assemblies demonstrate higher toxicity in cancer cells than in normal cells. The high antitumor efficacy and low side effects were also demonstrated in the in vivo experiments, which revealed the great potential of the selenium-platinum coordination assemblies in clinical cancer treatment. Selenium-containing polylysine dendrimers were also reported to coordinate with platinum. The coordination dendrimers with selenium-platinum cores exhibited high antitumor efficacy and low side effects via a ROS-involved mechanism similar to platinum coordinated EGSe.68 To develop nanomedicine with promising biosafety, Li et al.69 designed selenomethionine-based self-assemblies with anticancer activity. Selenomethionine\n8 Cell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020\nis a selenium-containing natural amino acid that acts as the main source of human selenium intake. Selenomethionine esters were synthesized and coordinated with cisplatin to attain selenium-platinum coordination complexes. A series of selenomethionine esters were synthesized with different hydrophilicity, which led to different self-assembly behaviors. The anticancer activity of the coordination complexes could be regulated by their self-assembly behaviors. These studies opened a new avenue for designing selenium-containing anticancer therapeutic agents.\nSelenium can interact with metals other than platinum. The interaction between selenium and gold was studied. Selenium was demonstrated to simultaneously reduce and stabilize chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) to prepare gold NPs (AuNPs) with diameters of 2 nm.70 The selenium-prepared AuNPs exhibited anticancer activity, while AuNPs are commonly considered nontoxic to cancer cells. The anticancer mechanism involved elevating the intracellular ROS levels and inducing cell apoptosis, which was similar to that of selenium-platinum coordination complexes. Extended research has suggested that selenium could also coordinate with nickel, copper, and zinc. The coordination complexes also showed anticancer activities via ROSinvolved mechanisms.67 Inspired by these results, a platform for designing anticancer nanomedicines can be built based on interactions between selenium and various metals.\nWhen selenium-containing polymers were combined with porphyrins, the polymers exhibited light-induced anticancer activity. Porphyrin as a photosensitizer can generate singlet oxygen under visible light. The generated singlet oxygen can further oxidize selenium-containing groups and induce cell apoptosis. Sun et al.71 incorporated porphyrins into diselenide-containing hyperbranched polymers. Upon exposure to visible light, singlet oxygen was generated and then oxidized diselenide bonds to form seleninic acid, which exhibited cytotoxicity to MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. To improve anticancer efficacy, they incorporated porphyrins into polymers containing b-seleno diesters, which are more sensitive to singlet oxygen (Figure 6).72 Monoselenide in b-seleno diesters was reported to be easily oxidized to selenoxide and then eliminated from the diesters, which was known as selenoxide elimination reaction. Upon exposure to NIR light, the singlet oxygen generated from porphyrin could oxidize b-seleno diesters via the selenoxide elimination reaction and exhibit anticancer activity to MDA-MB-231 cells. The anticancer mechanism was demonstrated to involve acrylates generated by the selenoxide elimination reaction. After monoselenide was oxidized and eliminated, acrylates were formed on the polymer chains, which had the ability to deplete intracellular GSH in cancer cells, thus inducing cell apoptosis by ROS overproduction. In this system, b-seleno diesters acted as both ROS-responsive and ROS-generating groups. The ROS generated by acrylates would further accelerate the selenoxide elimination reaction. In this way, the polymers showed high sensitivity to light irradiation and achieved a persistent generation of ROS even under dark conditions. This research opened new avenues of selenium-containing nanomaterials in the field of photodynamic therapy.\nRecently, selenium-containing polymers were reported to demonstrate cancer immune activity and were applied in combinations of cancer immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Li et al.73 revealed the cancer immune activity of seleninic acid, which downregulated human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E) in cancer cells and then activated the immune activity of natural killer (NK) cells. They developed diselenide-pemetrexed assemblies by co-assembly between cytosine-containing diselenide and the chemotherapeutic drug pemetrexed (Figure 7). Under mild g-radiation, diselenide bonds were cleaved and oxidized to seleninic acid, which evoked\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 9\nFigure reprinted with permission from Sun et al.72 Copyright 2019 Elsevier.\nthe cancer immune activity of NK cells.74 The chemotherapeutic drug pemetrexed was released at the same time, achieving a combination of cancer immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The combination therapy exhibited improved antitumor efficacy against both primary tumor and tumor metastasis with low side effects. In addition, diselenide-containing polymeric NPs were used for combination therapy by encapsulating the chemotherapeutic drug DOX.75 DOX exhibited synergistic effects in combination with diselenide-containing polymers and g-radiation. The combination therapy downregulated HLA-E expression and upregulated interferon g (IFN-g) generation in both primary tumor tissues and tumor metastases, which confirmed the improved immune activity. These studies revealed the potent cancer immune activity of selenium-containing molecules, providing new opportunities for selenium-containing nanomaterials in cancer immunotherapy."

      "text" : "SeNPs are another large category of selenium-containing nanomaterials that are widely applied in cancer-related studies. Selenium exists in several oxidation states,\n10 Cell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020\nFigure reprinted with permission from Li et al.73 Copyright 2020 Wiley-VCH.\nincluding +6, +4, +2, 0, and 2. SeNPs normally refer to NPs composed of selenium in the zero oxidation state. The synthesis techniques of SeNPs can be mainly divided into physical, chemical, and biological methods. SeNPs synthesized by different methods possess various morphologies and surface modifications, but generally contain cores of selenium in the zero oxidation state and exhibit similar anticancer mechanism in cancer treatments.\nAlthough SeNPs were reported to show antioxidant activity in inflammatory diseases, they mostly showed a strong ability to induce ROS generation in cancer treatment.76–78 In 2010, Shakibaie et al.79 revealed that SeNPs were toxic to the fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080. They inhibited the invasion and metastasis by downregulating the matrix metalloprotein-2 expression in cancer cells. The next year, Kong et al.80 studied the cytotoxicity of SeNPs against prostate LNCaP cancer cells. They found that SeNPs inhibited the proliferation of LNCaP cancer cells through caspase-mediated apoptosis. SeNPs can activate the Akt-Mdm2 pathway and then decrease the transcriptional efficiency of androgen receptors, thereby inducing cell apoptosis. Wang et al.81 further demonstrated the in vivo antitumor activity of SeNPs against hepatocarcinoma cell line H22. They also revealed that SeNPs preferentially distributed in cancer cells and caused cytotoxicity by inducing ROS production.\nHowever, the bare SeNPs met the problems of solubility and stability in physiological conditions. To solve these problems, various polysaccharides were used to coat SeNPs. Chen and Yang et al.82 and Zeng et al.83 encapsulated SeNPs with Spirulina polysaccharides to enhance their stability. The encapsulated SeNPs showed higher\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 11\ncellular uptake and anticancer efficacy. They inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell line A375 by inducing cell apoptosis. Polysaccharide-protein complexes from mushrooms were also used to decorate SeNPs. Hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups of polysaccharides and imino groups of proteins were supposed to enhance the stability of SeNPs.84\nIn addition, the stability of SeNPs can be enhanced via various types of surface modification. The modified SeNPs can load different chemotherapeutic drugs and exhibit improved anticancer efficacy.85 Liu et al.86 decorated 5-fluorouracil (5FU) on the surface of SeNPs through S–O and Se–N bonds to form 5FU-SeNPs. The surface decoration improved the cellular uptake of SeNPs into cancer cells, leading to higher anticancer activity against melanoma cell line A375. The 5FU-SeNPs induced cell apoptosis via ROS generation and caspase-9 activation. They also exhibited great selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells, which were anticipated to be good candidates as chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Huang et al.87 also developed DOX-loaded SeNPs, which were further coated with transferrin, a cancer-targeting protein. The NPs showed enhanced cellular uptake through endocytosis in cancer cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, as well as high selectivity between cancer cells and normal cells. They triggered ROS overproduction, which activated p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, thus inducing cell apoptosis. The NPs exhibited high antitumor activity in nude mice xenograft models, which opened a new path for the design of synergistic chemotherapeutic agents. SeNPs can even achieve co-delivery of different anticancer drugs. Xia et al.88 developed RGDfC peptide-modified SeNPs loading both DOX and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of human homeobox protein Nanog. RGDfC peptide enhanced the cellular uptake of the SeNPs into heptocarcinoma cell line HepG2 through clathrin-associated endocytosis. The SeNPs induced cell apoptosis and exhibited significant gene-silencing efficacy, exhibiting improved anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. The co-delivery system held enormous potential for the development of combination cancer therapies.\nIn addition to chemotherapies, SeNPs can be combined with radiotherapies.89–91 SeNPs fabricated with PEG showed X-ray-responsive properties.92 The SeNPs internalized by cancer cells degraded upon exposure to X-rays and exhibited synergistic anticancer efficacy. Under X-ray irradiation, the SeNPs significantly induced ROS generation, which led to mitochondria dysfunction and cell apoptosis. The study by Yu et al.92 demonstrated the function of SeNPs as radiosensitizers to develop combination therapy between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. To achieve higher antitumor efficacy, Yang et al.93 designed folic acid-conjugated SeNPs and combined them with radioactive 125I seeds. The folic acid conjugation and radioactive seeds enhanced the targeting efficiency of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy to tumor tissues, which led to high antitumor efficacy and low side effects. Thermoresponsive hydrogels containing SeNPs were further developed for localized cancer therapy (Figure 8).94 PLGA-PEG-PLGA block copolymers were fabricated into thermosensitive hydrogels to encapsulate SeNPs and the chemotherapeutic drug sorafenib. SeNPs and sorafenib could be continuously released from the hydrogel in tumor tissues. Upon exposure to X-rays, SeNPs induced ROS production and accelerated cell apoptosis through the caspase-3 pathway. Combined with the chemotherapeutic effect of sorafenib, the nanosystem showed synergistic antitumor efficacy in mice up to 21 days after a single injection.\nRecently, SeNPs were revealed to potentiate cancer immunotherapy. Human gd T cells showed promising antitumor activity in cancer immunotherapies. Hu\n12 Cell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020\nFigure reprinted with permission from Zheng et al.94 Copyright 2019 Elsevier.\net al.95 demonstrated that SeNP-pretreated gd T cells showed even higher antitumor activity compared with gd T cells themselves (Figure 9). Mechanistic studies indicated that SeNPs could interact with the microtubule network and lysosomes in gd T cells, promoting the modification of tubulin acetylation, which potentiated the antitumor immune activity. SeNP-pretreated gd T cells further upregulated the expression of NKG2D, CD16, and IFN-g, and downregulated the expression of PD-1, which resulted in enhanced antitumor efficacy. The new strategy improved the antitumor immune activity of gd T cells by SeNPs, implicating a promising clinical perspective for SeNPs in cancer immunotherapy."

      "text" : "In this review, we highlighted representative selenium-containing nanomaterials developed for cancer treatment. On the one hand, selenium-containing nanomaterials are used as drug delivery carriers to achieve the controlled release of anticancer drugs. Diselenide- and monoselenide-containing nanomaterials are two main groups of materials that are sensitive to certain stimuli, such as redox, light, and radiation. The high sensitivity to internal or external stimuli allows selenium-containing nanomaterials to deliver anticancer drugs in controlled manners. The promising biocompatibility further endows these nanomaterials with great potential for applications as biomaterials in cancer treatment. On the other hand, some types of selenium-containing nanomaterials possess anticancer activity on their own, which can be used directly as anticancer drugs. Organic selenium-containing nanomaterials and inorganic SeNPs are two main groups of materials with anticancer activity. Normally, they induce cancer cell apoptosis by triggering intracellular ROS generation and activating caspase-based signaling pathways. The ROS generation ability can be further combined with various chemotherapies and radiotherapies to achieve\nCell Reports Physical Science 1, 100111, July 22, 2020 13\nsynergistic antitumor efficacy. Recently, the cancer immune activity of selenium-containing nanomaterials has been discovered, opening new avenues for their applications in cancer therapies.\nStudies about selenium-containing nanomaterials are still in the early stages. Nanomaterials used for cancer treatment mainly focus on diselenide, monoselenide, and SeNPs. However, selenium chemistry is a large field composed of numerous compounds and reactions. Biological activities of various selenium-containing compounds remain unexplored, which may offer more possibilities to design novel nanomaterials. Even the explored selenium-containing nanomaterials have not been studied thoroughly. Selenium in different chemical environments is reported to regulate ROS levels. However, it is still difficult to compare the anticancer activities and mechanisms between these nanomaterials involved with different forms of selenium. Selenium-containing compounds are reported to show both antioxidant and prooxidant abilities in different concentrations and environments, but smart regulation and switching between these two properties still have not been achieved. In addition, 25 selenium-containing proteins are found in human bodies with different functions. Selenium-containing nanomaterials possess the potential to demonstrate abilities other than the regulation of ROS. The recently revealed cancer immune activity is an example. In the future, we anticipate that selenium-containing nanomaterials can be applied in much broader fields than we have discovered."

Current clinical cancer treatments are unsatisfactory in terms of both antitumor efficacy and biocompatibility. Meanwhile, nanomaterials attract much attention as potential treatment strategies with improved antitumor efficacy and reduced side effects. Selenium-containing nanomaterials are considered to be a promising biomaterial candidate among many different approaches during the last decade. Selenium-containing nanomaterials exhibit good biocompatibility since selenium is an essential trace element in human body. With rational design, selenium-containing nanomaterials show high sensitivity to redox stimuli and anticancer activity. Here, we discuss the development of selenium-containing nanomaterials as drug delivery carriers and anticancer drugs for cancer treatment. The nanomaterials with promising performance both in vitro and in vivo could advance to clinical therapies.",
