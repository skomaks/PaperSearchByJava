      "text" : "The paradigm of chemical activation rates in cellular biology has been shifted from the mean arrival time of a single particle to the mean of the first among many particles to arrive at a small activation site. The activation rate is set by extremely rare events, which have drastically different time scales from the mean times between activations, and depends on different structural parameters. This shift calls for reconsideration of physical processes used in deterministic and stochastic modeling of chemical reactions that are based on the traditional forward rate, especially for fast activation processes in living cells. Consequently, the biological activation time is not necessarily exponentially distributed. We review here the physical models, the mathematical analysis and the new paradigm of setting the scale to be the shortest time for activation that clarifies the role of population redundancy in selecting and accelerating transient cellular search processes. We provide examples in cellular transduction, gene activation, cell senescence activation or spermatozoa selection during fertilization, where the rate depends on numbers. We conclude that the statistics of the minimal time to activation set kinetic laws in biology, which can be very different from the ones associated to average times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Decades of research have revealed the rates and identities of molecular pathways underlying cellular responses [1]. But in most cases, the underlying physical scenario remains unclear.\nWe shall review here how large numbers of molecules, which are obviously redundant in the traditional activation theory, define the in vivo time scale of chemical reactions. This redundancy is particularly relevant when the site of activation is physically separated from the initial position of the molecular messengers. The redundancy is often generated for the purpose of resolving the time constraint of fast-activating molecular pathways. Activation occurs when the first particle finds a given small target and causes activation. The time scale for this activation is expressed in the forward rate constants, which depend on very different geometrical features than those used in the traditional mass-action law, reaction-diffusion equations or Markov-chain representation of stochastic chemical reactions. These classical geometrical parameters are the size of the small binding targets and their local mean curvature when they are positioned on the surface, or volume of the chemical compartments and many more. We do not review here general first passage time questions associated to biology, already reviewed in [20,33,43,45–47,92].\nThe description of finding the first particle to reach a target belongs to extreme statistics that describe the tail distributions of rare events, falling into three classes: Gumbel, Frechet, or Weibull [25]. Previous applications of extreme statistics include estimating the minimum temperature and maximum daily precipitation, estimating the probability of an unusually large flooding events as well as predicting financial crises [64].1 However, it appears that the presence of extreme but rare trajectories explain the underlying mechanism and determines the time scale of key molecular and cellular processes. For example, the ability of cells to divide seems to be controlled by the shortest telomeres [8,16], which are the ends of chromosomes: following each cell division, the telomere length can be shortened or elongated, but when the shortest one reaches a threshold, the cell stops dividing. Thus this process is an extreme event [28,81,96].\nWe review below several examples of extreme statistics applications in the context of cellular transduction. We first describe recent formulae that characterize the fastest Brownian particles arriving at a narrow absorbing window. These formulas are derived in [14], using asymptotic analysis in the limit of large number of particles and small target size in dimensions 2 and 3. The first application concerns gene random activation, through the search process of the fastest, resulting in the selection of a single type of surface receptor in the immune B-cell. We then present several examples of cellular transduction, starting with calcium signaling at synapses of neuronal cells. We illustrate how the fastest calcium ions can trigger an avalanche of calcium ions, leading to an amplification of the initial signal. Another significant example is the fastest particle to arrive at a small target in the context of fertilization, where the presence of disproportionately enormous number of spermatozoa, relative to a single ovule, remains an enigma. Yet, when the number of spermatozoa is reduced by a factor of four, infertility ensues [15]. The final example concerns the statistical analysis of the length of the shortest telomere reaching a threshold. The first time for such an event to happen defines the maximal number of cell divisions [28,81,96] and thus it shows again how extreme statistics is involved in regulating fundamental cellular processes. In the last section, we discuss the optimal trajectories associated to the fastest arriving particle, which are geodesics starting at the initial point and ending at any point in the narrow-absorbing window. The analysis of extreme statistics can explain the apparent waste of resources in so many natural systems [63,97]. Numbers matter and wasting resources serve an optimal purpose: selecting the fittest. For modeling search processes related to ecology or species, we refer to [10,66,70]."

      "text" : "Extreme events cannot be captured by the classical mass-action paradigm for chemical reactions. Mass-action theory of chemical reactions between two reactants in solution, A and B , is expressed as\nA k1 k−1 B,\nwhere k1 and k−1 are the forward and backward reaction rates, respectively.\n1 See also wikipedia Generalized extreme value distribution www.en .wikipedia .org /wiki /Generalized _extreme _value _distribution and extreme value theory www.en .wikipedia .org /wiki /Extreme _value _theory.\nFirst, the computation of the backward rate has a long history that goes back to Arrhenius law k−1 = K0e−E/kT , where K0 is a constant and E is activation energy, and Kramers’ rate, derived from the stochastic Langevin equation for the prefactor A. For the past sixty years, chemical physicists computed the activation energy E and clarified the role of the energy landscape, with extensions to applications in chemistry, signal processing (time until loss of lock in phase trackers [80]), finance (time for a binary option price to reach a threshold), and many more [47].\nSecond, the forward rate k1 represents the flux of three-dimensional Brownian particles arriving at a small ball or radius a. Smoluchowski’s 1916 forward rate computation shows that\nk1 = 4πDca, (1) where D is the diffusion coefficient, when the concentration c is maintained constant far away from the reaction site. When the window is in a smooth surface or inside a hidden cusp, the forward rate k1 is the reciprocal of the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) of a Brownian particle to the window. The precise geometry of the activating small windows has been captured by general asymptotics of the mean first arrival time at high activation energy. This mean time is, indeed, sufficient to characterize the rate, because the binding process is Poissonian and the rate is precisely the reciprocal of the MFPT. These computations are summarized in the narrow escape theory [34,42,46,58,94]. For example, when the small absorbing window represents binding at a surface, the forward rate is given by\nk−11 = | |\n4aD [ 1 + L(0) + N(0)\n2π a loga + o(a loga)\n] , (2)\nwith | | the volume of the domain of Brownian motion, a is the radius of the absorbing window [46], and L(0) and N(0) are the principal curvatures of the surface at the small absorbing window. Formula (2) reveals that on average a particle visits at least once all balls (of radius a), which form a minimal covering of the entire space , before it exits through the small absorbing window (Fig. 1).\nThe forward rate k1 has been used in almost all representations of chemical reactions: it is the basis of the Gillespie algorithm [31,40] for generating statistics of stochastic simulations with rate k1. It has also been used in coarsegraining of stochastic chemical reactions into a Markov chain. However, the rate k1 is not used in simulations of Brownian trajectories, but in this case, the statistics of arrival times can be computed directly. Obviously, diffusion theory computes k1 from the mean arrival rate of a single particle.\nHowever, in cell biology, transient biochemical processes are often activated by the first (fastest) particle that reaches a small binding target, so that the average arrival time of a single particle does not necessarily represent the time scale of activation. In particular, when there are no initial molecules (the steady-state concentration is zero), the Smoluchowski rate cannot be used to describe the rate of arrival of the fastest, because using this rate relies precisely on the assumption of a constant non zero concentration at infinity. Thus even the Gillespie algorithm would give a rate, sampled with mean k1. But, as seen below, its statistics are strikingly different from the rate of the fastest arrival. This difference is the key to the determination of the time scale of cellular activation that can be computed either through a\ncomplete Brownian simulation of all particles and/or asymptotics of the fastest particle. This is an important departure from the traditional paradigm."

      "text" : "Gene activation depends on the arrival of a transcription factor to a specific gene location [1,69]. The time scale of this activation is thus defined by the first transcription factor to arrive, and depends on the complex motion of the Transcription Factor (TF), switching between different motion types. Indeed, a TF can diffuse fast or move slowly for local base pair scanning or switch to a three dimensional diffusion. The local organization of the chromatin can also play a key role in such search processes [2,61,72]. Thus, the time for a TF to find a gene for activation depends on the number of copies present in the nucleus, the chromatin organization and the dynamics of the TF. Today, we are still missing a closed relation between these different quantities. In addition, most simulations have so far ignored the role associated with the first TF to arrive to a gene and instead focused on the mean arrival time [73]. However, there are other cellular situations where the time scale of the first one is much less important than the selection of one of the many copies of genes. Indeed, the first one to be activated is actually a key event for gene selection and specific cell differentiation. One example is the selection of a single olfactory receptor: of hundreds or thousands of possible receptors, only a single one is expressed in an olfactory cell [1].\nAnother example associated to an extreme first passage event in immunology is the gene mechanism responsible for the selection and expression of a specific membrane receptor on B cells. Many of these receptors bind directly to recognize a piece of a pathogen and specifically antigens that are usually proteins, peptides or polysaccharides (see wikipedia “B cell”). Indeed, bacteria, viruses, parasites, and altered self cells can be recognized due to the large production of antigens in the body from B and T cells [1].\nWe shall now recall briefly the mechanism responsible for gene selection and the production of a specific antibody (IgH) responsible to bind antibody, once they are expressed on the cell surface. Before this expression, in side the nucleus, three different gene segments, called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes have to assemble together. However the nucleus contains many of these segments at various places of the chromatin (Fig. 2). The physical scenario that has emerged is that these segments randomly meet and assemble (Fig. 2). Once a combination is chosen, a unique antigen receptor is produced to recognize and bind to an associated partner located on the surface of a host cell.\nHow do VDJ recombine randomly? The first recombination event to occur is between one D and one J gene segment of the heavy chain locus [57]. This process can be modeled as the first encounter time between two monomers located on a polymer [3,36]. The polymer model can be Rouse [6], beta [4], RLC [84] or others. The encounter process was recently modeled by anomalous diffusion [59]. After the D–J recombination is formed, it is followed by the search and the joining of one V gene segment (Fig. 2). Since there are many copies of V, it is conceivable that the first one that encounter a D–J formed segment, will lead to a permanent binding selection. In that case, this event selects a specific V(D)J gene, which precisely falls into the extreme statistics of the first gene locus V to meet a DJ target site (Fig. 2). The productive V(D)J gene rearrangement leads to the surface expression of many copies of the same selected receptor (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the VH regions span a genomic distance of 2.5 Mbp surrounded by cross-linker proteins. Using an anomalous diffusion model, the search time for the first 100 VH and one DHJH segment in a confinement of radius 1 µm led to a time scale of few to tens of seconds, depending on the VH configuration [59]. It would be interesting to derive an expression for the first arrival of a V to one of the DH targets, using a polymer model and especially to quantify the role of the local chromatin condensation, measured by cross-linkers [35,85]. To conclude, in immune cells, the selection of a specific V(D)J gene rearrangement follows the law of an extreme search statistics driven by the fastest event. This example shows that extreme statistical events do not only define time scales, but they also serve as selection processes of antibodies."

      "text" : "Chemical activation in cell biology starts with the binding of few molecules, see Fig. 3. The signal is often amplified so that a molecular event is transformed into a cellular signal. How fast is this activation? When there is a separation between the site of the first activation and that of amplification, what defines the time scale? When particles move by diffusion, is it sufficient that the first particle arrives to a receptor site to open it, leading to an avalanche either through\nthe entry of ions or the opening of neighboring receptors (Fig. 3A–C). Thus the time scale of activation is not given by the reciprocal of the forward rate, but rather by the extreme statistics, that is, by the mean arrival time to the activation site (target) of the first particles."

      "text" : "The statistics of the first particle to arrive at a target can be computed from the statistics of a single particle when they all are independent and identically distributed [24,78,86,100]. We briefly recall the theoretical context. With N non-interacting i.i.d. Brownian trajectories (ions) in a bounded domain that bind to a site, the shortest arrival time τ 1 is by definition\nτ 1 = min(t1, . . . , tN ), (3) where ti are the independent arrival times of the N ions in the medium. The distribution of τ 1 is expressed in terms of a single particle,\nPr{τ 1 > t} = PrN {t1 > t}. (4)\nHere Pr{t1 > t} is the survival probability of a single particle prior to binding at the target. This probability is computed by solving the diffusion equation [79]\n∂p(x, t)\n∂t = D p(x, t) for x ∈ , t > 0 (5)\np(x,0) = p0(x) for x ∈ ∂p(x, t)\n∂n = 0 for x ∈ ∂ r\np(x, t) = 0 for x ∈ ∂ a,\nwhere the boundary ∂ contains NR binding sites ∂ i ⊂ ∂ (∂ a = NR⋃ i=1\n∂ i, ∂ r = ∂ −∂ a). The single particle survival probability is\nPr{t1 > t} = ∫ p(x, t) dx, (6)\nso that Pr{τ 1 = t} = d dt Pr{τ 1 < t} = N(Pr{t1 > t})N−1 Pr{t1 = t}, where Pr{t1 = t} = ∮ ∂ a ∂p(x,t) ∂n dSx .

(8)\nNew statistical properties have been recently derived for the shortest time [14]. They are expressed in terms of the shortest distance from the source S to the absorbing window A, measured by the distance δmin = d(S, A), where d is the Euclidean distance. Interestingly, the trajectories followed by the fastest are as close as possible to the optimal trajectories. In other words, the associated trajectories of the fastest among N concentrate near the optimal trajectory (shortest path) when the number N of particles increases. For a diffusion coefficient D and a window size a, the expected first arrival times of N i.i.d Brownian particles initially positioned at the source S are expressed in the following asymptotic formulas [14,56,60]:\nτ̄ d1 ≈ δ 2 min 4D ln (\nN√ π\n) , in dim 1, valid for N 1 (9)\nτ̄ d2 ≈ δ 2 min\n4D log\n( π √ 2N\n8 log ( 1\na\n) ) , in dim 2, for N log( 1 ε )\n1 (10)\nτ̄ d3 ≈ δ 2 min\n2D √√√√log ( N 4a2\nπ1/2δ2min\n) , in dim 3, for Na2δ2min 1. (11)\nThese formulas show that the expected arrival time of the fastest particle is in dimension 1 and 2, O(1/ log(N)) (see Fig. 4). They should be used instead of the classical forward rate in models of activation in biochemical reactions. The method to derive formulas (9) is based on short-time asymptotic and the Green’s function representation of the Helmholtz equation [14]. These formulae can be generalized to any density distribution ρ of initial particles such that ∫\nρ(A)dSA = N . Indeed, if we consider the case of dimension 2, the mean arrival time for the fastest is computed by averaging over the density ρ in the domain with surface | |, leading to\n〈τ̄ d2ρ 〉 = ∫\nd2(S,A)\n4D log\n( π √ 2ρ(A)| |\n8 log ( 1\na\n) )ρ(A)dSA.

      "text" : "There are many examples of molecular transduction triggered by the arrival of the first particles at an activation site, which defines the time scale of activation [29]. First, neuronal connections often occur on a dendritic spine, where the fast calcium increase in dendrites may happen a few milliseconds after initiation in the spine head. This time scale is incompatible with diffusion alone [46]. It was shown recently that such a short time scale is generated by an avalanche reaction triggered by the arrival of the fastest calcium ion at a receptor (see Fig. 3B). A similar process occurs in fly’s photoresponse to the absorption of a single photon: the first TRP channel that opens is due to the local diffusion of several IP3 molecules and calcium ions produced after rhodopsin activation [50].\nIn another context, the post-synaptic current is generated when the first receptor of a neurotransmitter is activated (Fig. 3C). This activation is mediated by the release of thousands of neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic terminal. Two binding events on the same receptor are required for the first channel activation. The time scale of this process is defined by the arrival of the first two neurotransmitters at the same receptor. The disproportionateness between the number of neurotransmitters (2000 to 3000) and the low number of receptors (5 to 50) compensates for the low probability of finding the small targets (receptors) [46,89].\nAnother transduction pathway (Fig. 3B) is the one of IP3, which begins with the activation of mGluR receptors and leads to IP3 production. These molecules have to diffuse and bind to the first IP3 receptor in order to trigger a calcium release, which leads to the amplification of the response. The number of activated IP3 and the location of IP3 receptors sets the time scale of this transduction pathway."

      "text" : "We now discuss in details how the statistics of the fastest particles arriving at a small target followed by an amplification step, determines the timescale of calcium signaling in microdomains such as dendritic spines [98]. We already presented a schematic representation at neuronal synapses Fig. 3A. In such situation the first arriving calcium ions to arrive at a receptor trigger transduction. This fast arrival can be a general mechanism occurring in micro-cellular compartments such as leaflets, astrocytes endfeets, long protrusions or dendritic spines.\nWe recall that dendritic spines (Fig. 7) are the locus of contact between two neurons [98]. They can contain an organelle called spine apparatus (SA), which is an extension of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We now explain how modeling and simulations have been used to demonstrate that calcium transients during synaptic inputs is triggered by the fastest calcium ion trajectories to a target called Ryanodine receptor (Fig. 8A blue).\nAfter calcium ions enter into dendritic spines, they can bind to endogenous buffers, get extruded by pumps into the extracellular medium or be pumped into the SA by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase pumps (SERCA3). It is also well known that calcium ions induce calcium release from internal SA stores through the ryanodine receptors (RyR) [83,99]. However, the specific calcium regulation by SA remained unclear due to the fast dynamics and the spine nanometer-scale organization.\nThe time scale of calcium transient during classical protocols used in physiology such as long-term plasticity [23] is of the order of hundreds of milliseconds [17,82] but not faster. The interpretation of fast calcium transient (faster than tens of milliseconds) cannot be described correctly in the setting of classical diffusion, but is compatible with the extreme statistics of the fastest ions.\nWe now describe the following experiment about calcium transient in a dendritic spine induced initial at the position of red star (Fig. 8B). What is the number of particles inside the head and arriving at the end of neck? The answer to these questions is addressed both experimentally and using stochastic simulations in Fig. 8C–D. First, the number of particles decays in head (blue curve), following a single exponential with a time constant of τ = 5.38 ms (Fig. 8C), but in parallel, the calcium concentration in the dendrite (red box in the inset) increases in few milliseconds, a result that is inconsistent with classical diffusion. A hypothesis was that the calcium increase could be triggered by the fastest ions, but the concept of extreme statistics due to the fastest particle cannot be directly tested experimentally, because it is hard to detect one or two ions, that will perturb the receptor activation. But it was tested using numerical stochastic\nsimulations (Fig. 8B and D): in the literature, to simulate calcium dynamics in synapses and dendritic spines, there are two possible modeling approaches: one is based on the deterministic reaction-diffusion equations [38,93] and the other one is based on stochastic modeling [21,46,48,51,77].\nThe stochastic simulations of diffusing ions is now classical: dendritic spine geometry is modeled as a spherical head connected to a narrow cylindrical neck [48] (Fig. 8B). The SA is modeled with a similar geometry with a neck and a head positioned inside the spine [13].\nCalcium ions are described as Brownian particles following the Smoluchowski’s limit of the Langevin equation Ẋ = √2Dẇ, where w is the Wiener white noise. Ions can diffuse inside the cytoplasm, and they are reflected at the surfaces of the spine and the SA (Snell–Descartes reflection).\nSimulations are designed to replicate the release (uncaging) experiments (Fig. 8C), where calcium are released in the center of a ball. The transients are measured in the two regions (rectangles) showing the ions leaving the spine head (blue) and those arriving at the dendritic shaft (red) located at the base, that are considered to be lost and do not return to the spine during the timescale of the simulations (absorbing boundary). The inner surface of the spine head contains 50 absorbing circular disks with a 10 nm radius, which models calcium pumps.\nClassical diffusion theory cannot account for the fast calcium experimental results: indeed for a Brownian particle released in the spine head, the mean arrival time to the base of a spine has been computed asymptotically [46]\nτ̄ = V 4Da [1 + a πR log( R a )] + L\n2\n2D + V L πDa2 , (30)\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient, a, R and L are the spine neck radius, head radius and the total length of the neck respectively. Using the classical parameter values, the narrow escape time or the mean first arrival time is estimated τ̄ ≈ 120 ms, comparable to the classical FRAP experiments [87,98]. However, the time scale of calcium activation showed a much shorter time scale (see Fig. 8C–D), which can only be explained by the statistics of arrival of the first Pr{τ 1 = s} and two first Pr{τ 2 = s} ions (Fig. 8E–F).\nThe analytical solutions derived in eq. (7) superimposes with the stochastic simulations, confirm the consistency of the stochastic simulations and the theory of the extreme statistics. To conclude, analytical approaches show the role of the fastest ions in setting the timescale of calcium-induced-calcium release by RyR activation.\nAnother characteristic of the extreme statistics is the path associated with the fastest arriving particle: it is very close to the shortest geodesic going from the initial point to the RyRs. This is much different compared to the paths associated with the mean arrival time, which typically visit the entire volume prior to reaching a small target. Finally the extreme statistics analysis resolves the apparent paradox that the SA obstructs the passage from the spine head to the dendrite and prevents calcium ions from diffusing. Indeed, analysis and simulations show that the fastest ions arriving at the base, passed through narrow passages avoiding obstacles.\nTo conclude, we presented here a fundamental example of molecular transduction mediated by calcium ions, where the timescale of the transient event is generated by the fastest Brownian particles. This initial step is followed by an amplification mediated by calcium induced calcium release, Fig. 8. Furthermore, the distribution of arrival times of the fastest ions depends on the initial number of calcium ions, which is a signature of extreme statistics and rare events.\nFinally, molecular activation initiated by the fastest particles is likely to be a generic mechanism in cellular transduction that can occurs in micro-compartments such as protrusions, astrocyte endfeets and more. The search of a target by the first among many particles is the mechanism that defines the timescale of biochemical activation in nanoand micro-domains, when the source of diffusing particles and the binding targets are spatially separated. Modeling and simulations based on refined properties of calcium dynamics allowed nowadays to make testable predictions, such as the asymmetrical distributions of Ryanodine receptors and SERCA pumps located at the base and in the head of the spine respectively. These distributions have recently been confirmed experimentally [13]."

      "text" : "Recent analysis of super-resolution microscopy single particle trajectories of ER luminal proteins revealed that the topological organization of the ER correlates with distinct trafficking modes [41]: a dominant diffusive component in tubular junctions and a fast flow component in tubules. In addition, molecular trafficking was associated to time periods of unidirectional inter-node displacements. During specific periods of times, ranging from 30 ms to 3 s, a tubule can pass proteins only from one direction, before switching at a random, Poissonian time. Since the ER network is composed of nodes connected to three junctions in average, it may happen that proteins are trapped in a node, until one direction of tubule switches. This mechanism is an active-waiting transportation, where molecules have to wait a random time before being transported from one node to the next one. The consequence of this unusual network transportation is that molecules travel together by recurrent packets, which is quite a large deviation behavior compared to classical propagation in graphs [27]. This form of transportation is associated with an efficient and robust molecular redistribution inside cells, where the fastest proteins arrive to a node located far away using shortest paths on graphs. To conclude, the unidirectional node transportation can generate long waiting times, but the fastest of many particles to travel in the ER defines the time scale of transport or redistribution of proteins, which is precisely a consequence of the extreme statistics principle, and constitutes a large deviation from classical diffusion on graphs."

      "text" : "In the key step of fertilization, sperms have to find the ovule within the short time it is fertile (Fig. 9). Thus the arrival of the first few sperms gives them much higher chance to fertilize the ovule. The number of swimmers matters\nwhen we consider the first one that finds a neighborhood of the egg. A simplified model of spermatozoon motion in a bounded domain is rectilinear with constant velocity\nẊ = v0u, (31) where u is a unit vector chosen from a uniform distribution. Upon hitting an obstacle at a boundary point X0, the velocity changes to\nẊ = v0v, (32) where v is chosen on the unit sphere in the supporting half space at X0 from a uniform distribution, independently from u. This model2 captures the crude sperm dynamics, neglecting the additional motion induced by the flagella [30].\nIn the absence of guide mechanisms, random reflection is the key element that determines the search time to a small egg target. The expected search time in two- and three-dimensional balls and domains that resemble the uterus geometry depends on the geometry of the domain is ion two dimensions, for ε 1\nE[τε] = KS v0ε , (33)\nwhere K is a constant, equal to 8 π\nfor a disk [97]. However, the egg in the uterus is often located at the entrance or inside one of the fallopian tubes (Fig. 9A). The entrance of these tubes forms a geometrical cusp (Fig. 9B inset), very different from the geometry of a ball. In a two dimensional approximation (flat uterus), the mean time for a spermatozoon described by equations (31)–(32) and random reflections at the boundary, to arrive at the entrance of one cusp of size ε (red region in Fig. 9A) [97] is\nE[τε] = KCS v0εα , (34)\nwhere KC is a dimensional constant and the exponent α has been estimated numerically α = 0.66. However, the exact relation between the exponent α and the geometry of the domain remains an open question.\nIn three dimensions, in a ball of volume V , the search time is given asymptotically by E[τε] = KVv0ε2 . The formula for a domain of arbitrary shape is unknown. Finally, the search time for the rectilinear model of sperms motion is much longer than for a diffusing particle, which is O(log 1\nε ) in dimension 2 and O( 1 ε ) for a cusp [44]. We conclude\n2 Pineapple Science Award (Math Prize) 2018, Chinese version of Ig Noble Prize, see also https://www.guokr.com /article /442886/.\nthat spermatozoa stay much longer in the domain before they can find the target. But, when there are many swimmers, this long period is reduced and can be seen as a selection process based on intrinsic spermatozoa properties, to select the fittest one.\nBy increasing the number of trajectories (Fig. 9), when computing the arrival time of the first one, the associated trajectories is concentrated near the optimal ones (white dashed lines in Fig. 9). The optimal trajectory is indeed the geodesic that joins the initial point to the final egg location. The shortest search time is achieved by the geodesic that minimizes the functional\nmin = inf AT T∫ 0 d(s) ds, (35)\nwhere d(s) is the Euclidean distance at time s and\nAT = {x : x(0) = x, x(T ) = y, where x are piecewise constant trajectories}, (36) as indicated by the results of simulations (Fig. 9).\nAlthough the exact scaling law between spermatozoa number and the volume of the uterus has not been derived, Fig. 10 shows a general tendency of an increasing function. Interestingly, the mean time for spermatozoa to reach the oviduct seems to be of the same order across species, although the size of the uterus varies drastically: 15 min for Human, Mice and Guinea pigs, around 15–30 minutes for rats, few minutes for rabbits. For dog and sheep, the time spreads from few minutes to hours, few to tens of minutes for cows. This surprisingly low variability in the time scale is due to the compensation by the sperm count, revealed by formula τ ≈ V 2/3\nDia v0 log N , where Dia is the diameter of the\nuterus (which can be seen as a cylinder with two horns) and the spermatozoa velocity is v0. Numerical simulations of [97] confirm that the mean time is around 8 to 9 hours, while the first one to arrive is of the order of 20 minutes, confirming the role of the fastest.\nTo conclude, models and simulations for the trajectories of the fastest spermatozoa, which result from the directed motion model, reveal that the extreme trajectories trace the most effective path. These are the optimal (bang–bang) solutions of a classical control problem (Fig. 9 and [97]). This result suggests that linear trajectories might not be generated by any chemotaxis at a distance of a few centimeters, which is too far away from the source. Similarly, it is not clear how other physical scenarios, such as rheotaxis or thermotaxis contribute to sperm guidance [39]. It is thus\nconceivable that extreme statistics are responsible for selection of the fastest trajectories determined by spermatozoa dynamics in the uterus and in fallopian tubes. The number of spermatozoa is thus the main determinant of the selection [74] and since the mean time for the first one to arrive is O(1/ logN), a large number of them is necessary to affect the search process. Reducing their number by a factor of 4 may cause infertility [15]. This situation is actually alarming due to the constant decline of sperm count (per ejaculate) in western countries [76], at a rate of 1.9% per year, between 1989 and 2005."

      "heading" : "6. Extreme statistics for the shortest telomere controlling senescence and cellular timing",
      "text" : "Another manifestation of extreme statistics in cell biology is the cell’s time perception: cell lifetime is reflected in the number of cell divisions prior to senescence (arrest of cell division), which is a measure of a cell’s lineage death and cellular aging [9]. It was suggested that the number of cell divisions could be represented by the length of telomeres, which protect the ends of the chromosomes (Fig. 11). Telomeres can lose between a few to hundreds of base pairs during cell division, or increase their length through the action of an enzyme called telomerase. Although the precise physical mechanism that regulates the number of cell divisions prior to senescence remains unclear, it becomes more and more evident that this time is expressed in the length of the shortest telomere [37], but how? Several decades of research have revealed that telomeres3 are made of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid,\n3 Telomeres are sections of DNA, found at the ends of each chromosome. They consist of the same sequence of bases repeated over and over. In humans the telomere sequence is TTAGGG. This sequence is usually repeated about 3,000 times and can reach up to 15,000 base pairs in length (see https://www.yourgenome .org /facts /what -is -a -telomere. Senescence means biological aging, telomerase is an enzyme that extends the telomeres of chromosomes [19,22,37,52,90,91]).\nwhich protect the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with other chromosomes. Following each cell division, the telomere ends become on average shorter [49]. Telomeres are necessary for the maintenance of chromosomal integrity and overall genomic stability [26,62] and in the absence of any mechanism of elongation, telomere length can only decrease over time [95]. As a result, a cell can divide only a finite number of times before proliferation is arrested. However, the mechanism that inhibits shortening via the action of telomerase by elongating telomeres necessitate the lengths of telomere are not simply monotonically decreasing, as modeled in [7]. However, when a critical length is reached, cell division stops (senescence). Interestingly, short telomeres are preferentially elongated by telomerase [91] and the shortest telomere is apparently a limiting factor of cellular proliferation [37].\nIt is not yet possible to monitor telomere dynamics throughout cell division, so that theoretical models have been used to predict telomere shortening under various conditions: models have revealed the molecular dynamics and the variability of triggering senescence in mammalian cells within a telomerase-deficient cell population [65,67,68,75,90].\nTo analyze the role of shortest telomere in senescence, stochastic models based on an asymmetric random walk were developed and validated against experimental data [28,81,96]. These models are described as jump processes (see equation (37) below), containing three parameters that were extracted in the case of budding yeast data [96]. One model was also used to study [28] the steady-state properties of telomeres, such as the length distribution of the shortest and the second shortest, demonstrating that there is a statistical gap between the two shortest telomeres. This gap suggested that the shortest telomere can play a key role in determining the number of cell divisions and in triggering senescence, by simply reaching the length threshold interpreted by the cell as a signal to stop dividing [18, 28,63,96]. Because the length of the telomere does not strictly reflect the number of cell divisions, the time-dependent telomere dynamics prior to senescence is also a determinant of the number of cell divisions prior to senescence.\nThe expected number of divisions of the majority of cells, beginning with yeast and up to human immune or reproductive cells, is about 70–100, while the shortening process allows the cell to survive only about 25–50 divisions [11]. As discuss below, the secret of extending the number of division using the shortest telomere dynamics is revealed by a quasi steady-state, in which the telomere length is sufficiently short for the telomerase-induced elongation to offset the division-induced shortening of the telomere. Interestingly, telomeres spend most of their lifetime in this state prior to senescence. Two stages are clearly distinct: in the arrival to senescence, the shorter period prior to reaching the above-mentioned state (of quasi-equilibrium) and the longer time spent there prior to senescence. Finally, we review here this model and discuss the role of the shortest telomere to reach the critical threshold of senescence. The time for the shortest telomere to reach a threshold event is again a manifestation of extreme statistics. The dynamics of this passage event explains the atypical random prolongation of cell replication."

The model assumes that the length decreases by a fixed length a with probability l(x), or, if recognized by a polymerase, it increases by a fixed length b a with probability r(x) = 1 − l(x). The jump probability r(x) is a decreasing function of x (see equation (38) below) with r(0) = 1 [28] that was found to match the experimental data of [96].\nThus the length of the telomere at the n-th division is an asymmetric random walk x(n). The maximal length of a telomere is L b. When the length decreases below a critical value T , the division process stops.\nThe problem at hand is to determine the evolution of the telomere length, to study the dynamics of the shortest length, and to identify the role of the probability r(x), which can be modulated by telomere diseases [8]. Of particular interest are the statistics of the trajectories x(n), their expected time to reach their quasi-stationary state, and the expected number of divisions before reaching the threshold T for the first time."

In that model, we used a shift in the definition of the right-probability r(x), that we chose here to be zero).\nThe results shown in Fig. 12 reveal two phases: in the first one, the telomere’s length decreases almost deterministically to a quasi-equilibrium length as described below. In the second phase, the length persists in the quasi-equilibrium state for the majority of divisions. In the absence of any stopping process, the telomere’s length stays near its minimum, so apparently the cell can live forever. As shown in Fig. 12, the condition b a (here b = 30 and a = 3) leads to an asymmetric jumps: far away from the small lengths (or near the senescence threshold), the probability r of a telomere increase is small, leading to many small shortening events, until the length is short enough and in that case, the probability to increase the telomere length is now much higher, leading to a larger jump of size of b."

The different histograms (Fig. 15A–C) show a clear separation between the arrival of shortest vs the other telomeres, independently of the chosen threshold T of senescence, modeled as an arrest of the dynamics length to simulate that the cell stop dividing.\nInterestingly, as the threshold decreases, the difference between the time to threshold increases, leading to a clear gap between the shortest and the second shortest lifetimes. However, this decrease in T leads also to an increase in the overlap between the distribution of the second and the third shortest telomere arrival time. This behavior can be interpreted using the phase diagram (two phases) in Fig. 13: as long as the threshold stays in the first phase, the telomere length decays deterministically and the difference between the first, second and third is insignificant. However, when the threshold is moved to the left of the critical point y0 (e.g., z = 300 for β = 0.045), reaching the threshold becomes a noise-activation process over a potential barrier, leading to a clear separation between the three. See also Fig. 14.\nIf the telomere length ensembles consisted of N Poissonian i.i.d. processes with escape time E[τ1] = τ̄1, the expected shortest escape time would be τ̄1\nN .

Thus to study the effect of the shortest telomere, we introduced in [81] the distance ratio between the first and second arrival time associated to the shortest and second shortest telomere to reach the threshold T :\nR1 = |E[τsecond] −E[τfirst]|√( E[τ 2first] −E[τfirst]2 ) , (55)\nwhere E[τfirst] (resp. E[τsecond]) is the MFPT for the first (resp. second) telomere length to reach the threshold T . Interestingly, for a threshold T = 150, the ratio computed for the difference between the first and second shortest telomere is R1 = 1.92 (for β = 0.045), while for the value β = 0.09, we get R1 = 1.16.

In particular, several consequences of telomere shortening can be seen as deregulation mechanisms of time sensing. Leukocyte telomere length can be used as a bio-marker of cardiovascular diseases, confirming that the distribution of telomere length and probably that of the shortest, plays a key role [16]. Similarly, adults suffering from major depression have shorter telomere length [16]. Finally, with aging, the average telomere length decreases and this is correlated with an increase in mortality. Thus the measure of telomere shortness could also be a statistical indicator of human mortality.\nMany cellular conditions can now be incorporated in modeling so that the distribution of telomere lengths and the shortest one can be predicted. Finally, to the question “Do biological cells sense time by the number of their divisions, a process that ends at senescence?” a possible answer is that the absolute time before senescence cannot be expressed by the telomere’s length and that a cell can survive many more divisions than intuitively expected. This apparent paradox is due to shortening and elongation of the telomere, described by an asymmetric random walk model of the telomere’s length. Activation escape from the potential well (to a threshold T ) generated by the process of shortening and elongation is the precise mechanism to extend the number of cell divisions before senescence, showing the role of stochastic fluctuations in a fundamental mechanism of cellular biology [81]."

Brownian trajectories inside a bounded domain . We recall the definition\nτ (n) = min(t1, . . . , tN ), (56) where ti are the i.i.d. arrival times of the N paths in the ensemble. Other types of motions can also be studied such as the rectilinear dynamics [97] for spermatozoa, switching dynamics to describe bacteria [32], transcription factor searching [72] or growth cone navigation [73]. In all these cases, it is in general quite difficult to determine the paths associated to the fastest arrival time τ (n). However, finding these optimal trajectories is useful to clarify the process of finding a target, the role of cellular crowding and of the redundancy principle. In the case of spermatozoa moving inside the uterus-like domain, which is not convex [97], optimal paths suggests that guiding sensors such as chemotaxis or thermotaxis do not really contribute in finding the egg far away [97]. Numerical simulations showed that trajectories of the fastest spermatozoa arriving to a narrow target are concentrated near the optimal trajectory of a control problem, described as a minimizers of the energy along admissible paths (Fig. 9).\nDescribing optimal paths for Brownian motion requires to track the history of the trajectory of n particles and to retain the one associated to the fastest. This algorithmic procedure follow the path-integral methodology [80]. We focus here on a generic example for the shortest arrival time among n trajectories in two dimensions, when a disk obstacle is located between the initial position and the narrow exiting window. When there are no obstacles, the asymptotic solution of the distribution of arrival time is constructed by the ray-method of the Green’s function [12,14]. In the context of molecular signaling in cell biology, shortest paths define the time scale of activation.\nWe present here heuristic arguments that led to the selection of a variational principle associated to the fast arriving particle.

The Wiener representation of the pdf for a pure Brownian motion is obtained for a zero drift and σ = D is a constant, so that it is given by the probability of a sampled path until it exits at the small window at the random time T [47]\nPr { xN(t1,M) ∈ ,xN(t2,M) ∈ , . . . ,xM(t) = x, t ≤ T ≤ t + t |x(0) = y }\n= [∫ · · · ∫\nM∏ j=1 dyj√ (2π t)n detσ (x)(tj−1,M))\n× exp {\n− 1 2 t\n[ yj − x(tj−1,N ) − a(x(tj−1,N )) t ]T σ−1(x(tj−1,N ))\n× [yj − x(tj−1,N ) − a(x(tj−1,N )) t] } , (59)\nwhere t = t/M, tj,N = j t, x(t0,N ) = y and yj = x(tj,N ) in the product and T is the exit time in the narrow absorbing window ∂ a . Finally,\n〈τ (n)〉 = ∞∫\n0\nexp ⎧⎨ ⎩n log ∫ p(x, t |y) dx ⎫⎬ ⎭dt = ∞∫ 0 τσ Pr{ Path σ ∈ Sn(y), τσ = t}dt, (60)\nwhere Sn(y) is the ensemble of shortest paths selected among n Brownian trajectories, starting at point y and exiting between time t and t + dt from the domain . The probability Pr{ Path σ ∈ Sn} is used to show that the empirical stochastic trajectories of Sn concentrate near the shortest paths starting from y and ending at the small absorbing window ∂ a , under the condition that ε = |∂ a ||∂ | 1. The paths of Sn(y) can be approximated using discrete broken lines among a finite number of points and we denote the associated ensemble by S̃n(y). Bayes’rule leads to\nPr{Path σ ∈ S̃n(y)|t < τσ < t + dt} = ∞∑ Pr{Path σ ∈ S̃n(y)|m, t < τσ < t + dt}Pr{m steps}\nm=0\nwhere Pr{m steps} = Pr{the paths of S̃n(y) exit in m steps} is the probability that a path of S̃n(y) exits in m-discrete time steps. A path made of broken lines (random walk with a time step t ) can be expressed using Wiener pathintegral. The probability of a Brownian path x(s) can be expressed in the limit of a path-integral with the functional:\nPr{x(s)|s ∈ [0, t]} ≈ exp ⎛ ⎝− t∫ 0 |ẋ|2ds ⎞ ⎠ . (61)\nThe survival probability conditioned on starting at y is given by the Wiener representation:\nS(t |x0) = ∫\nx∈ dx x(t)=x∫ x(0) D(x) exp ⎛ ⎝− t∫ 0 |ẋ|2ds ⎞ ⎠ ,\nwhere D(x) is the limit Wiener measure [80]: the exterior integral is taken over all end points x and the path integral is over all paths starting from x(0) [60]. When we consider n-independent paths (σ1, ..σn) (made of points with a time step t ) that exit in m-steps, the probability of such an event is\nPr{σ1, ..σn ∈ Sn(y)|m,τσ = m t} = ⎛ ⎜⎝ ∫\ny0=y · · · ∫ yj ∈ ∫ yn∈∂ a\n1\n(4D t)dm/2 m∏ j=1 exp\n{ − 1\n4D t\n[ |yj − yj−1)|2 ]}⎞⎟⎠ n\n(62)\nIndeed, when the are n paths of m steps, and the fastest one escapes in m-steps, they should all exit in m steps. Using the limit of path integral, we get heuristically using (62), the representation\nPr{ Path σ ∈ S̃n(y)|m,τσ = m t} ≈ ∫\nx∈ dx x(t)=x∫ x(0)=y D(x) exp { − n m t∫ 0 ẋ2ds } ,\nwhere the integral is taken over all paths starting at y0 and exiting at time m t . This formula suggests that when n is large, only the paths that minimize the integrant will contribute. For large n, this formula suggests that paths that will contribute the most are the ones that will minimize the exponent in eq. (63), which allows selecting the paths for which the energy functional is minimal, that is\nE = min X∈Pt T∫ 0 ẋ2ds, (63)\nwhere the integration is taken over the ensemble of regular paths Pt inside starting at y and exiting in ∂ a , defined as\nPT = {P(0) = y,P (T ) ∈ ∂ a and P(s) ∈ and 0 ≤ s ≤ T }. This formal argument shows that the random paths associated to the fastest exit time are concentrated near the shortest paths. Indeed the Euler–Lagrange equations for the extremal problem (63) are the classical geodesics between y and a point in the narrow window ∂ a .\nTo conclude, in the limit of large n, the Brownian paths contributing to the first moment of 〈τ (n)〉 are concentrated on the shortest paths, solution of the variational problem (63). The solution of the minimization problem (63) are geodesics starting from y to any point located on the small boundary ∂ a (Fig. 16). In absence of any obstacle inside a disk, the optimal path is the direct ray (path G in Fig. 17A) that was used to find the asymptotic solution [14]. When an obstacle is positioned between the initial point y and the narrow absorbing window ∂ a , the path associated with fastest arrival time among n trajectories can be computed from stochastic simulations. For large n, the empirical trajectories associated with 〈τ (n)〉 are concentrated near the two geodesic G1 and G2 (paths G1 and G2 in Fig. 17B) and the probability to find trajectories near the shortest one increases with n. Fig. 16A–B) show regular path (green) and the optimal trajectories associated to the first arrival time (purple and blue). The histograms of the first arrival\ntime (Fig. 16B upper) for shortest time associated to the short and long geodesic show the concentration phenomena for n = 20 and 500.\nIn the symmetric case, the two shortest geodesic of the same length consists of a straight line from y to the tangent of the disk obstacle, then an arc along the disk and finally a straight line from the tangent of the disk to ∂ a (Fig. 16).\nWhen the initial point y is not on the axis of symmetry, the two shortest geodesics have different lengths (Fig. 16B)."

      "text" : "Disproportionate numbers of particles in natural processes should not be considered wasteful, but rather, they serve a clear purpose: they are necessary for generating the fastest possible response. This property is universal, ranging from the molecular scale to the population level. It seems that nature’s strategy for optimizing the response time is not necessarily defined by the physics of the motion of an individual particle, but rather by the collective extreme statistics that select shortest paths.\nThis is precisely the strategy of finding a hidden target. The search process selects the particle to arrive first. Although these trajectories are rare, they are the ones that set the time scale.\nAnother key question is how the large numbers are set? Why the number of sperms is the one found for each species, but not ten times more?\nTen time less is associated to infertility [76], while ten times more would lead to a super-fertility that could be associated to too many progenitors. The same question can be asked for neurotransmitters released at synapses, around 2000–4000, probably to compensate the low probability to find gated receptors [46]. Probably evolution is responsible for such selection, through an unexplained mechanism. But one thing is clear: in biology, setting numbers larger than their actual values makes rare events possible within specified time windows with probability almost one.\nWe also saw in section 2.1 that extreme events in gene encounter is responsible for the large combination of the immune response. In section 6, we described how extreme statistics of the shortest telomere defines the number of divisions, a process that should now be understood as probabilistic. That is, the increase in the number of divisions, beyond the linear decrease of telomere length is set by the random event that the length of the shortest telomere crosses a potential barrier.\nAnother consequence of the extreme statistics principle is that molecular-level simulations of activation processes should avoid the Gillespie’s algorithm and reaction-diffusion equations, especially in the context of transient cellular activation induced by molecular pathways. Instead, straightforward Brownian paths and/or extreme statistics should be used as given by the formulas above. The large number of paths produces optimal trajectories that set the observed time scale. Finding extreme statistics based on physical models or stochastic description of single trajectories is likely to provide the missing explanations of many molecular processes in cellular biology and biophysics.\nIncrease in human population to the expanses of the entire nature may be part of an extreme statistic project of finding a hidden target or goal, the time of which could be in log of the number of the population."

    "abstractText" : "The paradigm of chemical activation rates in cellular biology has been shifted from the mean arrival time of a single particle to the mean of the first among many particles to arrive at a small activation site. The activation rate is set by extremely rare events, which have drastically different time scales from the mean times between activations, and depends on different structural parameters. This shift calls for reconsideration of physical processes used in deterministic and stochastic modeling of chemical reactions that are based on the traditional forward rate, especially for fast activation processes in living cells. Consequently, the biological activation time is not necessarily exponentially distributed. We review here the physical models, the mathematical analysis and the new paradigm of setting the scale to be the shortest time for activation that clarifies the role of population redundancy in selecting and accelerating transient cellular search processes. We provide examples in cellular transduction, gene activation, cell senescence activation or spermatozoa selection during fertilization, where the rate depends on numbers. We conclude that the statistics of the minimal time to activation set kinetic laws in biology, which can be very different from the ones associated to average times. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
