      "text" : "Recently, researchers have paid much concentration on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the low-price and huge supplies of Na source compared to lithium ion batteries (LIBs) [1–4]. Although the fundamental principle of electrochemical reaction of sodium is similar to that of lithium, Na-ion (0.106 nm and 23 gmol−1) has larger ionic radius and molar mass than Li-ion (0.076 nm and 7 gmol−1) which make it full of difficulty to explore high performance sodium storage materials [5–8]. Particularly, appropriate anode materials with high capacity and excellent cycling performance are still limited. As typical strategies, metal oxides (MO), metal sulphides (MS) and metal selenides (MSe) with conversion reactions have been developed as new electrode materials for SIBs due to their high mass specific capacity (M= Co, Fe, Sn) [9–11]. Cobalt selenide (CoSe2) nanomaterials have stable chemical properties, environmental friendliness and the marcasite structure similar to FeSe2, which lead to widespread applications such as, catalysts for hydrogen evolution, Li-air batteries, especially for promising anode material for SIBs [12–14]. However, electrochemical conversion and alloy reactions are usually accompanied with large volume expansion, continuous solid electrolyte interface (SEI) reestablishment and structure disintegration in the electrode, leading to a rapid deterioration of\nthe capacity for SIBs. Moreover, conventional rigid batteries cannot accommodate the flexible electronic devices development, such as wearable and foldable mobile device [15–21].\nGreat efforts have been made to construct nanoscale CoSe2 electrode to moderate the absolute strain generated upon the charge-discharge process. Kang et al. fabricated CoSe2/carbon nanotube composites using metal organic framework template, which displayed a discharge capacity of 424 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 200mA g−1 for SIBs [22]. Li et al. reported that CoSe2/nitrgon-doped carbon nanofibers composite anode, which can obtain a capacity of 350 mAh g−1 at a current density of 200mA g−1 after 400 cycles. However, the cycle life and capacity of CoSe2@carbon composite still can't meet budget needs [23]. Substantial improvements in nanostructure design and performance optimization of CoSe2 are still necessary.\nVarious nanostructured electrode materials have been designed to improve the sodium storage, such as one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials [24–27]. 1D nanostructure can accommodate the strain of Naions intercalation/disintercalation along a given orientation [28]. Simultaneously, the interval space of neighboring 1D nanostructure plays a structural buffer role, which can effectively prevent the agglomeration of active nanomaterials. 1D nanostructure can also facilitate electrolyte diffuse into the interior region of the active nanomaterials,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.062 Received 12 December 2018; Received in revised form 6 January 2019; Accepted 25 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

All rights reserved.\nT\nwhich leads to a long cycling life of the batteries. Moreover, for binderless electrodes, the construction of arrayed 1D nanostructure architectures on substrate can provide high-speed electron-transport access to the current collector. Getting the benefit of the orientable electron transmission channel and strong electric contact between active material and current collector, electrons could be rapidly transferred from the active sites to the current collector along a high-speed channel rather than haphazardly move in the chaotic network by movement through poor interparticle contacting regions. This feature is indispensable for improving the cycling and rate performance of anode nanomaterials. Moreover, much more specific area of 1D nanostructures than that of bulk counterparts provides more active sites and effectively shortens the channel of ion diffusion for batteries [29–31].\nHerein, a practicable electrospinning method has been used to build a 3-D interlinked network to solve the conductivity, Na-ion diffusion and structure stability of CoSe2 nanomaterials. The CoSe2 grains attached on the carbon nanofibers have the mean size about 60 nm and the optimized content about 53wt%. The customized CoSe2/CNFs are directly served as flexible electrode for SIBs, exhibiting superior electrochemical performance (430 mAh g−1 at a current density of 200mA g−1 after 400 cycles) and high rate capability (224 mAh g−1 even at 15 A g−1). The improvement electrochemical properties are ascribed to the following merits. First, the attachment structure can prevent the aggregation of CoSe2 grains during the prolonged cycling process. Secondly, the high conductivity carbon nanofibers can effectively enhance the electronic conductivity of electrode material. More importantly, the high loading mass of CoSe2 and bare CoSe2 grains can significantly improve the utilization of electrode materials and enhance the Na-ions diffusion."

To prepare the precursor solution, 1 g PAN and 0.8 g Cobalt (III) acetylacetonate were dissolved in 8mL of DMF for 3 h under magnetic stirring. The mixture was transferred into 5mL plastic syringe equipped with a 19-gauge blunt tip needle and electrospun on spinning system at 20 kV. An aluminum foil as the collector was located 13 cm away from the needle to collect the film and kept a pace with 8 rpm/min. The whole devices were placed in a inclosed box with a humidity lower than 50%. The ascollected nanofibers and comparison composite were all first heattreated in a tube furnace at 5 °Cmin−1 up to 280 °C in Air for 2 h to stabilize the fiber structure by reaction of PAN. Subsequently, the Co/ CNFs were obtained by carbothermal reaction at 700 °C for 3 h in Ar (80 vol%) / H2 (20 vol%). Finally, the films were selenized at 450 °C for 3 h in a closed glass tube full of inert gas to get CoSe2/CNFs."

      "heading" : "3. Result and discussion",
      "text" : "The CoSe2/CNFs electrode preparation details are shown in Fig. 1. Typically, the cobalt ions facilitate the formation of carbon and the carbon frame confines the growth of CoSe2 grains. Thus, CoSe2 nanoparticles uniformly attached on carbon nanofibers are successfully synthesized. The morphology of composites and the size of CoSe2 grains can be controlled by changing the precursor solution composition and reaction conditions.\nFig. 2a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples. All diffraction peaks of Co/CNFs sample correspond to Fm-3 m space group of cubic crystal system Co (JCPDS File No. 89–4037). After selenization in inert gas, the entire diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the cubic CoSe2 (JCPDS File No. 89–2002). No peaks of impurities are observed, demonstrating that CoSe2/CNFs with high fineness have been prepared by the practical electrospinning method. Moreover, the Raman spectra are used to certify the existence of carbon element. As shown in Fig. S1 (in the Supporting information), two characteristic peaks locating at 1363 and 1583 cm−1 can be attributed to the disorder-induced feature (D bands) and the E2g patterns of graphite (G bands) carbon, respectively [32]. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra further clarify the chemical change from simple substance cobalt to cobalt selenide (Fig. 2b, c). The Co 2p spectrum shows two major peaks, with located at 780.8 and 797.1 eV, respectively, corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, which can be\nattributed to the Co (Ⅱ) in CoSe2/CNFs. The binding energy located at 778.3 and 793.5 eV can be assign to the 2P3/2 and 2p1/2 of Co (Ⅲ), respectively, due to the partial surface oxidation [12,33]. In Fig. 2c, the binding energy of 59.1 eV can be attributed to the oxidation of CoSe2, which further confirm the existence of oxidation process. All results effectively indicate the carbonization and oxidation processes are complete and the final product is convinced.\nFig. 3a reveals the morphologies of electrospinning precursor fibers with investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The length of precursor fibers is more than 50 µm, which can provide a self-supporting frame structure for follow-up calcining process (Fig. 3a). After calcination, the fibers are scabrous and interlinked with a length of hundreds of micrometers (Fig. 3b). The average diameter of CoSe2/CNFs is about 450 nm and the size of CoSe2 grain is about 60 nm, respectively (Fig. 3c and Fig. S in the supporting information). All the prepared fibers are well interlinked into a conductive 3-D network, which can effectively form binder free and flexible films. Therefore, the contact between electrode materials and electrolyte are strengthened, which pronouncedly improve the long cycle life of SIBs. Fig. 3d shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the CoSe2/CNFs sample. The CoSe2 nanoparticles are uniformly attached on carbon nanofibers and the diagrams of particle size distribution in Fig. S2b (in the Supporting information). The selected\narea electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3e) is well indexed to the pure CoSe2 phase, corresponding to the diffraction peaks of (011), (110) and (101) planes shown in the XRD pattern. Meanwhile, the HRTEM image shows a clearly group of parallel fringes with a d-spacing of 0.354 nm, corresponding to the crystal (111) plane of cubic CoSe2. Fig. 3f shows the TEM elemental mapping images of CoSe2/CNFs, revealing that the CoSe2 nanoparticles are uniformly located on the carbon nanofibers. The content of CoSe2 grains in the carbon nanofibers are calculated by TGA-DSC curves (Fig. S3 in the Supporting information), based on the weight loss of carbon combustion and the mass ratio is ≈ 53wt%. This 3-D interlinked network proffers fast electronic transmission channels and high-speed Na-ions diffusion pathway due to the continuous CoSe2 grain attached on the carbon nanofibers. It also acts as a specific strong buffer region to accommodate the volume variation during Na-ions insertion/deinsertion.\nThe binderless and flexible films (CoSe2/CNFs) were directly served as anodes for SIBs and the electrochemical performance of CoSe2/CNFs was investigated by coin-type cells using Na-foil as the counter for SIBs. Fig. 4a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode between 0.01 and 3.0 V with a scan rate of 0.1mV s−1. In the first cathode scan, one distinct broad cathodic peak locates at around 0.82 V, which could be attributed to a multistep electrochemical reactions involving the decomposition of electrolyte and the formation of a\nsolid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer [34,35]. With corresponding to the cathodic peak, one obvious anodic peak at 1.95 V could be attributed to the desodiation process. Specifically, the cathodic and anodic peaks cycle split into two peaks in the first CV, which signifies the structural conversion and activation of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode materials during the first charge-discharge process. Three newly appeared cathodic peaks shift to higher voltage at 1.38, 1.11 V and a less obvious peak at 0.64 V, which correspond to the Na-ions intercalation (NaxCoSe2) and conversion (CoSe, Co) process. Meanwhile, two anodic peaks locate at 1.56 and 1.95 V, which correspond to the formation of NaxCoSe2 and CoSe2, respectively. These facts may certify the stepwise chemical reactions of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode, which are consistent with the previously reported CoSe2 materials [36,37]. The overall sodiation/desodiation reaction process of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode can be expressed as follow:\nSodiation:\nDesodiation:\nFig. 4b shows the charge-discharge profiles of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode at a specific current density of 200mA g−1. The initial discharge/charge capacities are 972 and 516 mAh g−1 of CoSe2/CNFs electrode, respectively, with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 53%. The great initial irreversible capacity can be attributed to the formation of a SEI film and electrochemical decomposition of the solvent on the electrode in the first cycle [38–40]. It is worth mentioning that a great deal of pyrolyzed carbon is present in the carbon nanofibers, which would decrease the initial Coulombic efficiency and Na storage performance of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode. Since the carbon nanofibers can only deliver a capacity of 70 mAh g−1 at a current density after 200\ncycles (Fig. S4 in the Supporting information), the capacity contributed by CoSe2 grain was around 430 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles, which provided a high capacity retention (83%). After the first cycle, the Coulombic efficiency of the second cycle is more than 98% and stays stable for the rest of the cycles. In addition, the discharge and charge plateaus are consistent with the CV peaks.\nThe cycling performance is pivotal for battery practical applications. As shown in Fig. 4c, the CoSe2/CNFs electrode exhibits stable cycling performances at a current density of 200mA g−1 with a high initial capacity of 972 mAh g−1 and an ending capacity of 430 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles. Even at a current density of 2 A g−1, the CoSe2/CNFs can still deliver a high capacity of 370 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles (Fig. 4e). For comparison, the ordinary CoSe2 nanoparticle electrode only can deliver a capacity of 81 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles due to the poor electroconductivity and volume variation during insertion/extraction process (Deception S1 and Fig. S5 in the Supporting information). Additionally, the cycled structure indicated that the CoSe2 nanoparticles aggregate together and some particles are fragmentized (Fig. S6 in the Supporting information). This result manifests the CoSe2 nanoparticles are not suitable for SIBs. The rate performance of the asprepared CoSe2/CNFs electrode is shown in Fig. 4d. Because the charge/discharge curves and capacity stay stable after ten cycles, so the rate property was conducted after cycling ten cycles at 200mA g−1. Along with the current density gradiently increases from 0.1 to 15 A g−1, the discharge capacity only slightly drops. When the current densities reach to 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, and 15 A g−1, the discharge capacities are 450, 416, 410, 383, 327, 278, 244, and 224 mAh g−1, respectively. This is one of the reports on the exceptional rate performance for SIBs. These results indicate that the CoSe2/CNFs anode shows higher reversibility capacity and better cycling performance than that reported CoSe2 material (Table S1 in the supporting information).\nThe process kinetics of CoSe2/CNFs electrode is further performed by CV at various scan rates to confirm the exceptional electrochemical performance for SIBs. The integration of capacitive and diffusion-limited redox reaction controls the charge-discharge processes, which were\ndeduced by CV curves and kinetic information. As exhibited in Fig. 5a, one pair of noticeable cathodic peaks at 1.38 and 1.13 V and two anodic peaks at 1.57 and 1.95 V are clearly observed, respectively, at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, which reappear intensively in following quick scans. This process can be evidently explained by a non-Faradaic or Faradaic behavior (Depiction S2 in the Supporting information) [41,42]. Fig. 5b depicts the linearity between log (i) and log (v) plots at various peak potentials. The b values are 0.94, 0.93, 0.93 and 0.95, which indicate that the electrochemical reactions of the CoSe2/CNFs electrode are entirely controlled by the pseudocapacitive behavior which leads to a fast Na-ion diffusion (high rate capability). By graphing I (V)/ ν1/2 vs. ν1/2 at various peak potentials, the values of k1 (slope) and k2 (intercept) were calculated (Depiction S3 in the Supporting information) [43–45]. This approach enables one to enumerate the fraction of the current at definite peak potentials to the capacitive and diffusion-controlled effects as shown in Fig. 5b. The total contribution proportions of Faradaic behavior at different scan rates are shown in Fig. 5c, and the pseudocapacitive contribution is calculated. As exhibited in Fig. 5d, the\ncalculated values are 0.87, 0.87, 0.86, 0.93 and 0.927 at the specific scan rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1mV s−1, respectively, indicating that the pseudocapacitive process dominantly occupies noticeable advantage of the whole Na storage capacity at high scan rates.\nFig. 6a illustrates the electronic delivery and Na-ions diffusion mechanism of CoSe2/CNFs electrode. After calcination, the fiber has an excellent electroconductibility, which provides an expressway for electrons transport. More importantly, the incomputable fibers could construct a giant transportation network, which can establish unexceptionable security assurance for large current charge/discharge process. Moreover, the CoSe2 grains attached on the carbon nanofiber could supply more active sites due to the bare structure, which are beneficial to Na-ions super-speed exchange. The 3-D interlinked network can effectively release the volumetric expansion during insertion/ deinsertion process. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is further used to clarify the conductivity of CoSe2 electrode and Na-ions diffusion mechanism during charge/discharge process. The result of EIS is presented in Fig. 6b. As a consequence, the CoSe2/CNFs electrode\nshows higher electronic conductivity and ion diffusion rate compared with CoSe2 nanoparticle. The simplified-contact-Randles equivalent circuit and more simulation information are shown in depiction S4 (in the Supporting information). It is noteworthy that Na-ion diffusion coefficient (D) directly influences the cycling performance of electrode material [46,47]. The calculation of D value is shown in Table S2 (in the Supporting information) and directly determined by Warburg factor (σ). The σ value is negative correlation with the D value and the σ values are exhibited in Fig. 6c. The σ values are calculated to be 17.6 and 578.6 for the CoSe2/CNFs and CoSe2 nanoparticle electrodes, respectively, which are accord with the slopes of the real part versus the square root of frequency, ω-1/2 [48,49]. Noteworthily, the CoSe2 grains are still attached on carbon nanofibers after 1000 cycles, which indicates the CoSe2/CNFs anode is tremendous stable for long cycle and large current charge/discharge (Fig. 6d). Moreover, the SEM structure of CoSe2/CNFs after high-rate cycling can still retain their origin morphology and structure without any CoSe2 nanoparticles aggregation which can be demonstrated by Fig. S7 (in the supporting information). All the results show that the CoSe2/CNFs 3-D interlinked network which is consisted of incomputable CoSe2/CNFs can effectively improve the conductivity, Na-ions diffusion and structure stability, which ensure the excellent performance and security for SIBs.\nWe have measured the electrochemical performance of full cells which are assembled by coupling NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode which can deliver a theoretical capacity of 117.6 mAh g-1) and CoSe2/ CNFs anode. The NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 has been regarded as a promising cathode material for SIBs because of its high-speed Na-ion diffusion, stable voltage plateau, and low price [50–54]. Therefore, Na3V2(PO4)3 is frequently applied as a cathode material to match with the CoSe2/CNFs anode. Fig. 7a illustrates the composition of the Na3V2(PO4)3-CoSe2/CNFs full cell. The CoSe2/CNFs electrode has been\nconfirmed to attain a six-electron reaction, and the Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode essentially possesses two Na-ions extraction capability. The overall reaction of the full cell is shown as followed:\nThe interlinked carbon nanofibers ensure the full cell possesses excellent flexibility and the charged full cell can light the LEDs with different color temperature (Fig. 7b) after repeated fold. Fig. 7b exhibits the cycling property of the full cell at a current density of 200mA g-1\nbetween 0.01 and 3.0 V. The full cell delivers a discharge capacity of 370 mAh g-1 based on the reference of CoSe2/CNFs at a current density of 200mA g-1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its promising potential for portable equipment and wearable products."

    "abstractText" : "The flexible binderless films composed of cobalt selenide grains attached on carbon nanofibers (denoted as CoSe2/CNFs) are prepared by electrospinning to enhance the electronic conductivity, Na-ions diffusion and alleviate volume variation during charge/discharge process for high performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The binderless and flexible CoSe2/CNFs electrode can obtain a high reversible capacity of 430 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at a current density of 200mA g−1, an exceptional rate capability of 224 mAh g−1 at 15 A g−1, even a capacity of 370 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of the homogeneous distribution of CoSe2 grains attached to the carbon nanofibers and the high electronic conductivity framework of 3D interconnecting carbon nanofibers, which can alleviate the volume variation during charge-discharge process and sustain the high electrical conductivity and fast Na-ions diffusion throughout the electrode. This binderless flexible CoSe2/CNFs nanocomposite electrode may hold great application promising for high cycling performance SIBs.",
