MD membranes are synthesized from hydrophobic polymers, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or polypropylene (PP), using various methods including phase inversion and electrospinning techniques. Recent literature on MD membranes clearly shows their important role in surface water/wastewater treatment and seawater desalination.

      "text" : "Water is an essential resource for living organisms and a key driver of various anthropogenic activities including irrigation, domestic and industrial applications.1 Although water is an important component of the water–food–energy nexus, serious concerns regarding water security and scarcity still persist; specifically, ease of access, availability, and water quality.2 Water security is highly affected by economic, social, and anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, industrial discharges, urban runoffs, and mine drainage of discharged brines.3,4 These activities introduce a wide array of organic [e.g. phenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and pesticides] and inorganic (e.g. sodium, magnesium, calcium, chlorides, fluorides, cyanides, sulphates and carbonates) pollutants into the water bodies.5 Most of these organic contaminants are carcinogenic and often cause illnesses and deaths when ingested.6 However, inorganic compounds (e.g. NaCl, NaF, KNO3, MgSO4, and FePO4) increase the water salinity and consequently affect the quality of water for further drinking, irrigation, and industrial applications.7\nMembrane technology has been extensively used as a separation technique to reduce the salinity of water from different sources. Additionally, membrane technology offers a relatively high rejection efficiency for particulate and dissolved organic matter from water.8 Membrane processes widely used in water desalination include reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF).9 These pressure-driven processes operate at high energy requirements\nand operational/capital costs.10 Although NF is less energetically demanding relative to RO, this membrane process has low rejection efficiencies towards sodium and chloride (i.e. notwithstanding the fact that these monovalent ions are the main constituents of saline water).11 Remarkably, the membrane distillation (MD) process has been found to counteract the operational challenges of RO and NF membrane technologies. Also, due to its significantly low energy requirement, MD could be a potential economically feasible technique comparable to pressure-driven membrane processes.12\n∗ Correspondence to: LN Nthunya or SD Mhlanga, Nanotechnology and Water Sustainability Research Unit, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, University of South Africa, Florida, Johannesburg, South Africa.

MD is a thermally-driven process in which water vapour molecules pass through a porous hydrophobic membrane. This process is enhanced by a vapour pressure induced by the temperature difference across the membrane;11 thus, offering the possibility of solution saturation without causing a significant flux decline.13 The heat energy required in the MD separation process can be generated by solar energy, geothermal energy, or waste-grade energy.14\nIn theory, the membranes used in MD processes should strictly allow the passage of vapours and retain non-volatile substances. Therefore, the filtrate would be close to 100% pure from solids or non-volatile contaminants.15\nHowever, the performance of MD is severely affected by two key factors: (i) wettability as a result of condensation of water vapour inside the pores of the membranes; and (ii) fouling due to the accumulation of biofilm, organic, inorganic, and colloidal substances on the surface or in the internal pore structure of the membranes.11\nThese two limiting factors restrict the choice of suitable polymers for the synthesis of MD membranes. Briefly, hydrophobic polymers promote hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions between pollutants and the membrane surface; thus, blocking the pores of the membranes and causing fouling.16 Furthermore, hydrophilic polymers enhance the wettability of the membranes; consequently, affecting the diffusion of water vapour through the membrane and compromising its rejection efficiency.8 As a result, numerous membrane modification studies have been conducted to concurrently overcome the fouling and wettability challenges associated with MD membranes.17,18 Although, MD is a promising technology widely tested at a laboratory-scale, its industrial implementation has yet been limited.\nTherefore, the goal of this article is to provide a critical and comprehensive review of the state-of-knowledge regarding MD process with insights toward better understanding its shortcomings and limitations. Additionally, recent advancements in membrane modification by the embedment of nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance fouling resistance and tackle wettability are emphasized; whereby areas for further work are recommended. Finally, cost implications and environmental sustainability of MD are also discussed to elucidate promising approaches for a future and successful implementation of MD at an industrial scale for the desalination of brackish water/seawater at high recovery rates."

In the casting process, a solution of a specific material is placed on a substrate to adopt the shape of the casting material and subsequently allowed to solidify under suitable conditions.19 Figure 1 shows an illustration of a membrane casting procedure using a casting knife. In this process, the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) solution is casted on a non-woven fabric to adopt its flat shape. The membrane is then coagulated in a water bath and peeled off from the non-woven fabric. The PVDF nanofibre membrane was spin-coated using titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) to enhance the super-hydrophobicity of the membrane.20\nThe most studied methods for the synthesis of MD membranes are phase inversion and electrospinning methods, involving interfacial polymerization, graft polymerization, and dip coating as membrane modification processes.\nFigure 1.

This transformation process can be performed using the following techniques:10\n(i) immersion precipitation, where the polymer solution is immersed in a coagulation bath to allow the exchange of solvents to occur;\n(ii) thermally induced phase separation, in which the de-mixing process occurs by subjecting the membrane to high temperatures;\n(iii) evaporation-induced phase separation, which occurs through the evaporation of the volatile solvent used to prepare the polymer solution of interest.\nThe phase inversion method can be applied in the synthesis of flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes. For the preparation of flat sheet membranes, the polymer solution is casted on a flat support material (e.g. glass) and subsequently immersed in a coagulating bath. The structural properties of the resulting flat sheet membrane would depend on the rates of exchange of the solvent and non-solvent.22 An example of immersion precipitation phase inversion of super-phosphorus (SP) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) NPs-modified thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is illustrated on Fig. 2. In this process, a solution of TPU and SP/LiFePO4\nis casted on a flat polyfluorotetraethylene (PFTE) substrate using a casting knife. The casted solution on the substrate is placed in distilled water (coagulation bath at 25 ∘C) to remove the solvent from the liquid-solution (de-mixing process) for 4 h. The solidified membrane is peeled-off from the substrate and dried at 100 ∘C for 2 h.21\nThe phase inversion preparation of hollow fibre membranes involves the extrusion of the polymer solution, coagulation and sintering of the coagulated hollow fibre.23 An illustration of the phase inversion preparation of hollow fibre membranes is provided in Fig. 3. The nanocomposite membrane is prepared through a solvent transfer-induced phase separation, followed by photopolymerization.24 Bicontinuous interfacially-jammed emulsions are used for the formation of NP-functionalized hollow fibre membranes. The ternary fluid is composed of silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO2NPs)-doped monomers and the bore/sweeping fluid is water. The co-extrusion of these fluids results in the formation of hollow fibres.24 To ensure the formation of uniform hollow fibres, the nozzle of the sweeping fluid is centred, and its viscosity is adjusted by the addition of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (1%). Photopolymerization is induced by UV-light irradiation, resulting in hollow porous NP-modified membranes. The aligned hollow fibre membranes are collected in a water-filled rotating glass cylinder.24"

The polymer surface tension is broken by these forces; thus, leading to the stretching and thinning of the polymer jet.26 The electrospinning and electrospraying techniques take place simultaneously under specific controlled conditions.27 Electrospraying occurs when entanglements and molecular cohesion of the polymer solution are not strong enough to sustain stream break-down (i.e. a process where a polymer solution is ejected from the capillary nozzle and drops as a result of jet breakage) during the ejection of the polymer solution. However, under favourable molecular cohesion conditions, the droplets form charged jets, which stretch due to electrostatic forces to synthesize uniform nanofibres.28 Simultaneous electrospraying and electrospinning can lead to the formation of beaded\nFigure 3.

The grafted polymer is thermodynamically stable since the monomer is covalently bonded to the core polymer. Graft polymerization is classified into three types: (i) grafting onto; (ii) grafting from; and (iii) grafting through. In grafting onto, the free radical active sites generated from the two polymers combine covalently to form a grafted polymer. In grafting from, the core polymer is initiated to form radicals, which subsequently react with the monomer to produce the desired graft polymer. In grafting through, the free radical active sites of the low molecular weight monomer reacts with the vinyl groups of the core polymer to form a graft polymer with well-defined side chains.33\nFigure 5 presents a typical graft polymerization process. Briefly, the polycarbonate membrane is treated with an argon plasma atmosphere and exposed to oxygen to promote the formation of hydroperoxide active radicals.34 These radicals enhance the formation of grafted membranes by initiating the graft polymerization of the acrylic acid.34 This technique was adopted by Korolkov et al.35\nto synthesize triethoxyvinylsilane-grafted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for enhancing membrane hydrophobicity.

Another key advantage of plasma polymerization is its environmental friendliness.37\nThis technique has been used by Song et al. to increase the hydrophobicity of MD hollow fibre membranes.38 The coating thickness induced by plasma polymerization is in the range of 1 to 2 μm.

      "heading" : "THE USE OF NANOPARTICLES IN MEMBRANE MODIFICATION",
      "text" : "Extensive research involving the modification of MD membranes with NPs has been conducted to overcome the challenges associated with membrane flux, fouling, wetting, and porosity.46–50 NPs are particulate materials with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm but larger than atoms and molecules.51 NPs include particulate metals such as silver (Ag), silica (SiO2), and titania (TiO2). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are able to penetrate through the cell walls of microorganisms, interact with their thiol groups and nucleic acids and bind to their enzymes, which leads to the destruction of their cell envelopes and eventual growth inhibition.52–54 Due to their toxicity towards several microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, viruses, and fungi), AgNPs have been used in many applications including water treatment, biomedicine, clothing, and textiles.55\nIn water filtration systems, AgNPs act as a preventive measure to reduce the formation of biofilms on the surface or inside the pores of the membrane, thus making the membrane less susceptible to fouling.56,57 However, when the AgNPs are deposited onto the membranes at high concentrations, they block the pores of the membranes, hence reducing the water fluxes.58 MD membrane fouling studies in the literature are dominated by organic fouling and inorganic fouling (also referred to as scaling).18,59 Although few studies on biofouling of MD membranes have been reported in the literature, biofilm formation has been recorded to significantly decrease the efficiency of MD systems.60 Zodrow et al.60\nhave demonstrated that the growth of bacteria in MD is hindered by high operation temperatures (≥ 60 ∘C) and high water salinity.60 Nevertheless, wastewater systems (i.e. mostly discharging to water bodies) are characterized by high concentrations of thermophilic bacteria used for the removal of biological oxygen demand (BOD).61 These thermophilic bacteria, mainly found in marine environments, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, and open surface waters, thrive in saline waters, high temperatures (≥ 80 ∘C) and would potentially induce membrane fouling in MD.62 There is no single study reporting the use of NPs for membrane modification in MD to hinder the growth of thermophilic bacteria.\nFigure 7. Dip coating in membrane modification.44\nJ Chem Technol Biotechnol 2019; 94: 2757–2771 © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry wileyonlinelibrary.com/jctb\n2762\nAt different sizes and degree of crystallinity, TiO2NPs exhibit different affinities towards water molecules.63 Small-sized TiO2NPs have also shown high hydrophilic properties as anatase.63 Therefore, these properties can be used to render hydrophilicity to the hydrophobic surface of MD membranes for decreasing the surface adsorption of hydrophobic organic foulants. Briefly, unfavourable polar interactions would occur between hydrophilic TiO2NPs and hydrophobic moieties on foulants. Also, a tightly-bound layer of water molecules on TiO2NPs would prevent interactions with foulants.64\nTo mitigate wetting challenges associated with MD membranes, SiO2NPs have been extensively used to enhance the hydrophobicity of PVDF membranes by rendering their surfaces super-hydrophobic with contact angles higher than 160∘.47,65 Khumalo et al. tested organic modification of SiO2NPs using hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS) and subsequent embedment in PVDF flat sheet membranes.66,67 The resulting membranes were characterized by hydrophobic properties (contact angle ≈ 115∘) which enhanced MD performance for the recovery of hydrolysed urine. Silane reagents such as octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS), N-octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS), chlorodimethyl-octadecyl silane (Cl-DMOS) could be used to further enhance membrane super-hydrophobicity. The OTMS molecule is characterized by a long aliphatic carbon chain (CH3(CH2)17-) where the anchor group is (-Si-OCH3)3. Furthermore, the anchor groups on ODTS and Cl-DMOS are (-Si-ClCH2)3 and (-Si-Cl3)3, respectively. 68–74 The anchor groups on OTMS are more hydrophobic due to the presence of bulky non-polar CH3 groups. The presence of strong electron withdrawing atoms such as chlorine and oxygen in Cl-DMOS and ODTS cause an uneven distribution of electrons, which could subsequently induce a minimal polarity on one end of the molecule, and slightly reduce its hydrophobicity. This differences in the hydrophobic nature of the SiO2NPs give rise to different performances in MD membranes.75,76\nMembranes prepared in alcohol as a non-solvent during the inversion phase also display intrinsic properties, which result in the formation of super-hydrophobic membranes.47 These membranes are characterized by improved water fluxes as well as high separation efficiencies.46,47 Wang et al.77 synthesized hydrophobic membranes using SiO2NPs, chitosan hydrogel, and fluoro-polymer, i.e. the latter was added to confer amphiphilic properties to these MD membranes for the selective separation of oil from water.77 This membrane exhibited high oil–water separation efficiencies compared to commercial hydrophobic PVDF membranes.77\nNot only do super-hydrophobic characteristics improve the anti-wetting capabilities of membranes, they also enhance self-cleaning properties by a process called lotus effect.78 However, for membranes to attain this lotus effect (i.e. lotus leaf ), they should be characterized by high contact angles close to 180∘ and significantly low sliding angle, i.e. the smallest angle that would allow an easy roll-off of water droplets and sufficient removal of dirt from materials.79,80 This lotus effect assists in the generation of a slip flow as well as in the reduction of drag forces, and thus would be useful in membrane purification of seawater.81 Rezaei et al. grafted super-hydrophobic SiO2NPs on the surface of PVDF membranes to mimic the effect of a lotus leaf on liquid repellent.82\nSiO2NPS were characterized by water-hating methyl functional groups which subsequently improved the contact angles of the membranes from 139∘ to 154∘. The water-membrane contact angle and roughness observed in this study was similar to those shown by many other previous studies reporting a\ndecrease in membrane wetting and an improvement on membrane fouling resistance.30,46,47,65,82 In addition to several studies reporting the use of SiO2NPs and TiO2NPs for enhancing membrane hydrophobicity,30,65,82–84 graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also been observed to render MD membranes super-hydrophobic.31,85 Graphene and CNTs are characterized by benzene rings and sp2 carbon atoms arranged hexagonally. This arrangement gives rise to an aromatic ring that is composed of relatively non-polar C–C and C–H bonds which are not solvated by water molecules.86 Therefore, graphene and CNTs are hydrophobic in nature unless they are functionalized with hydrophilic moieties such as carboxylic functional groups and thus enhance membrane resistance to wetting.87 Not only do graphene and CNTs considerably enhance the anti-wetting membrane properties, they also improve their mechanical strengths, which is essential in MD operations.31,85 The incorporation of oxidized graphene and CNTs revert the membrane hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity; thus, assisting in the prevention of membrane fouling.88,89 A summary of NP-enhanced membranes for MD processes is presented in Table 1.\nThe low rate of water production is another setback associated with MD, which could be mitigated by the use of nanofibre membranes. Remarkably, high fluxes have been recorded due to the high porosities of nanofibre membranes;102 which are also characterized by high surface roughness that allows air entrapment in the membrane surface roughness.85 This entrapped air promotes the repellence of water droplets, thus further improving membrane hydrophobicity.103"

      "text" : "Several studies have reported the possible use of MD in a variety of separation processes. MD has been applied in the recovery and concentration of nutrients, removal of organics, bacteria, and toxic metal contaminants from water,122–124 purification of oil spills,125 and desalination of seawater, brackish water, and industrial brines.121,126 All these applications involved the use of commercial and laboratory-scale synthesized nano-enhanced membranes.30,95,96,127 For instance, a TiO2-modified PVDF membrane was tested towards organic fouling resistance in a DCMD system and the results were compared to those of pristine PVDF membranes.83 Although both pristine and modified membranes showed similar fouling behaviours, the flux recovery was significantly higher in the modified membranes.83 Applications for the recovery of water from different types of solutions in MD are summarized in Table 3.\nRemarkably, MD has a distinct transport mechanism that allows the recovery of precious minerals. This process is induced by the pre-concentration of the product to be recovered on either side of the membrane as a function of the mineral vaporization energy. The non-volatile compounds are concentrated at the feed side of the membrane while volatile compounds are concentrated at the permeate side.134,135 This is achieved at a temperature below the critical temperatures of the material being separated to avoid the formation of supercritical fluids in cases where the liquid and vapour state of the compounds are indistinguishable from each other.136 The production of ammonia is mostly performed in a solvary process. However, in a recent study,137 1 M of free ammonia was recovered from a feed concentration of 0.2 M in a vacuum membrane distillation process. The recovered\nand concentrated ammonia can be precipitated for a further production of struvite. This is a cost-effective method for the production of fertilizer,138 and thus contributes to the concept of water-food nexus. Several studies have also shown the separation and concentration of minerals such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) in an HCl/H2SO4 (sulphuric acid) mixed system, ionic liquids L-lysine-HCl syrup, extracts, and juices as well as the removal of other contaminants in the presence of organic foulants using commercial and nano-enhanced membranes in MD.139–141 Whereas toxic metals (e.g. boron) and organic dyes are removed from water at a 50% efficiency in microfiltration (MF) and forward osmosis (FO), 99% removal efficiencies have been achieved in nano-enhanced MD.142–146\nNevertheless, MD is highly affected by flux decline in recovery processes that include volatile hydrophobic organics as they cause membrane fouling due to hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions between the organics and the surface of the membrane.147,148\nIn order to understand the membrane and foulant interactions, the following model theories are applied: Zisman theory, Owens/Wendt theory, Fowkens theory and van Oss theory.149–152\nThe Zisman theory generally works best for non-polar surfaces. In order to account for polar type interactions, Owens and Wendt developed the harmonic mean method. Although the Owens/Wendt theory works best for polar surfaces, it requires numerous probe liquids to be tested for contact angles against the membrane–solute interactions being evaluated, leading to a lot of work. Therefore, van Oss modified the Owens/Wendt theory to cater for non-specific (van de Waals) interactions. Thus, the van Oss theory is currently the most studied theory for determination of the membrane–solute interactions for evaluation of membrane fouling.66,153,154\nIn the van Oss theory, three probe liquids are used to determine the surface free energy of the membrane and the interfacial free energy between the membrane and the foulant (solute). The most commonly used probe liquids are de-ionized water, glycerol and diiodomethane. Diiodomethane is used as the dispersive (non-polar) liquid while de-ionized water and glycerol as polar liquids.

While MD remains as one of the most promising processes\nin membrane technology, MD research has drifted towards the development of cost-effective methods for the treatment of saline water. Recent studies have focused towards flux enhancement, fouling mitigations, optimization of membrane properties, improvement of membrane wetting resistance using nano-enhanced membranes, optimization of operational parameters, and configurations.49,156 Remarkably, the separation of salts from brine, seawater, and brackish water by MD is efficient at a level that allows the permeate to be used for almost any domestic application (i.e. purification efficiency> 99%).46,47 However, DCMD or VMD remain susceptible to fouling at high water recoveries due to the presence of salt precipitates (e.g. scaling). He et al. demonstrated the capacity of hollow fibre membranes to sustain flux decline in the presence of supersaturated precipitating salts close to the membrane surface.157 Furthermore, Song et al. indicated that the hollow fibre membrane surface design, module design, and cross-flow conditions are key parameters for attaining stable water fluxes and high rejection efficiencies even when the\nJ Chem Technol Biotechnol 2019; 94: 2757–2771 © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry wileyonlinelibrary.com/jctb\n2766\ndesalination process is subjected to precipitating salts close to the membranes.39"

      "text" : "The concept of desalination has long been investigated to mitigate the water scarcity challenges brought about by inadequate freshwater sources that fail to meet the current water demand. This involves the application of efficient processes such as RO and NF. These processes operate under high pressures, and thus consume a lot of energy resulting in high operational costs. In order to counteract the high operational costs in pressure-driven membrane technology, MD (i.e. which is a highly efficient desalination process) has long been investigated at laboratory scale. Regardless of the advantages in MD, piloting of this process has been relatively slow.\nThe rate at which researchers have devoted their efforts to MD has exponentially increased over the years. Such efforts involved the application of commercially available nano-enhanced membranes in water desalination at laboratory-scale. An analysis of the research and development trends in the area of MD, previously documented by Thomas et al.,158 clearly shows the occurrence of three phases: initiation, emergence, and growth. As shown in Fig. 9, an escalation in the number of publications for these three phases depicts a generally positive outlook in the development of MD. While MD research was virtually non-existent in the 1980s, most of the research efforts were directed towards further development of MD process during the early to mid-2000s. The current research boom being experienced in MD processes is gearing towards commercialization,158 with a specific focus in material improvements involving the use of nanomaterials.30,46,47,83,94 Ali et al.159 conducted a study that linked publications, patents, and project pilot plants trends to work related to MD development (Fig. 10). To this end, several companies that are focusing on the application of MD technology in water desalination have been identified. These companies include Aquastill and Aquaver in the Netherlands, Memsys in Germany, and Gold Technologies in the United States. Other companies involved in pilot projects in Singapore are also emerging.11\nDespite MD research work advancing to pilot-scale level, a cost–benefit analysis of the technology is rarely reported. Khayet160 has suggested a lack of cost–benefit analysis and energy consumption studies as the main hindering parameter for the development of large-scale MD. Currently, no studies related to the cost-analysis of NP-incorporated MD membranes have been reported, even though several studies have reported the use of NPs in the enhancement of membrane performances.30,95\nAlbeit, some studies have provided general information related to the MD operational cost without necessarily considering the cost implications associated with the incorporation of NPs onto MD membranes. Table 5 provides a summary of cost estimations for MD water purification systems. The figures outlined in Table 5 were calculated using information obtained from the literature. The rate of water production for some MD systems could not be determined due to a lack of information related to the estimated cost of water production.\nThe cost of water recovery in MD depends on a number of factors, including the cost of operational materials, the tax associated with the production of carbon dioxide from the energy required in MD processes, and many others.169–171 In the case of the low cost of heat that is free from taxes (e.g. the use of solar energy), MD becomes cheaper than highly energy demanding processes such\nas RO and NF.173 It was estimated that the cost of water production of 17 m3 d−1 in MD using geothermal energy is approximately $13 m−3.164 In the case where the heat supply in MD was sourced from electricity or fuel-fired plant, Meindersma et al.165 have calculated that the total cost of water was $0.16–0.17 m−3, relative to $0.25–0.35 m−3 required for a RO process.165 The cost estimated at the Memtill’s water recovery systems demonstrated that MD can reduce the cost of water desalination to $0.26–0.54 m−3. This considerable reduction was ascribed to the use of sustainable and cost-effective plant materials to build the operational modules as well as the use of low-cost heat supplies.165 When determining the cost implications associated with water production in MD, the general parameters that were taken into consideration include the plant availability and capacity, interest rate (%), amortization, modules and membrane assembly ($ m−2), installation ($), supporting equipment, ($) electrical cost ($ kW−1 h−1), steam cost ($ kg−1), labour cost ($ m−3), brine disposal ($ m−3), maintenance cost (%), pre-treatment cost ($ m−3), thermal energy requirement (kW h m−3), emission factor for natural gas (kg CO2\n-e kW−1 h−1), emission factor for electricity, (kg CO2\n-e kW−1 h−1), electrical energy requirement (kW h m−3), and carbon tax ($ t−1 carbon).167,169–172"

      "text" : "Research directed towards MD is currently increasing at a remarkable rate. Various innovative fabrication and modification procedures for MD membranes have been reported in the literature and were summarized in this review. It has been found that NPs-modified membranes provide essential properties that mitigate the challenges associated with MD processes. It has been reported in several studies that these modified membranes attain high water-repellent characteristics, i.e. super-hydrophobic properties, which subsequently assist in the prevention of wetting inside the membrane pores. These super-hydrophobic properties allow the passage of water vapour through the membrane and prevent the passage of water in liquid state, thus enabling the recovery of high-quality water for domestic use. Although biofouling of thermophilic bacteria origin has been observed in MD\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/jctb © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry J Chem Technol Biotechnol 2019; 94: 2757–2771\n2767\nprocesses, no study involving the use of well-known antibacterial NPs such as AgNPs have been reported. The rationale behind the use of AgNPs is to incorporate them in the preparation of biofouling-resistant membranes to hinder the growth of bacterial thermophiles.\nSeveral applications of MD processes have been tested at laboratory-scale using different configurations. A review of results from studies involving the use of NP-modified MD membranes for the treatment of seawater, wastewater, brackish water, and surface water provide cost implications associated with this separation process. However, sustainable development towards commercialization has been moving at a slower rate with indications of some water treatment plants based in a few developed countries. It is imperative to systematically develop even more cost-effective purification systems that are integrated with emerging membranes to produce high quality water at large industrial throughput. Nanofibre membranes are less reported in MD applications compared to flat sheet membranes. However, the rate of water recovery of the former supersedes that of flat\nsheets. Nanofibre membranes suffer critical challenges of low industrial throughput, and their synthetic procedures involve the use of complicated techniques requiring specialized skills. The equipment used in nanofibre production are high-voltage driven (≥ 10 kV). They also require conducting material collectors and mostly fail to produce uniformly aligned nanofibre membranes. Therefore, high throughput low cost nanofibre production requires future consideration.\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the NP-modified membranes are a one-step solution to address many problems associated with MD. NP-incorporated membranes also create a path for achieving super-hydrophobic membranes with contact angles above 150∘, which are capable of self-cleaning through the lotus effect process. Carefully designed methods for the incorporation of NPs into these membranes offers the possibility of developing cost-effective and high-performance water recovery technologies. In this regard, breakthroughs in the sustainable and commercial viability and implementation of MD processes in the industrial-scale recovery of water are anticipated.\nJ Chem Technol Biotechnol 2019; 94: 2757–2771 © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry wileyonlinelibrary.com/jctb\n2768"

    "abstractText" : "Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally driven process that uses low-grade energy to operate and has been extensively explored as an alternative cost-effective and efficient water treatment process compared to conventional membrane processes. MD membranes are synthesized from hydrophobic polymers, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or polypropylene (PP), using various methods including phase inversion and electrospinning techniques. Recent literature on MD membranes clearly shows their important role in surface water/wastewater treatment and seawater desalination. Modification of MD membranes with nanoscale materials significantly improves their performance, preventing wetting and fouling. This review presents a critical assessment of the progress on the use of nanomaterials for the modification of MD membranes. The techniques commonly used to synthesize MD membranes, the modifications that have been adopted for the incorporation of nanomaterials onto membranes, and the unique properties these nanomaterials impart on the membranes are discussed. The use of modified membranes in different MD configurations and their application in groundwater, surface water, wastewater, brackish water and seawater treatment is reviewed. Finally, cost implications, commercial viability, environmental sustainability, and future prospects of MD are also discussed to elucidate promising approaches for a future and successful implementation of MD at an industrial scale. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",
