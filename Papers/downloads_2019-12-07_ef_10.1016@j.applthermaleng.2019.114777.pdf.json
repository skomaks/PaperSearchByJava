      "text" : "1 Effect of porous medium and nanoparticles presences in a counter-current\nTo solve the problem of low thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCMs), three different methods including geometry modification, adding nanoparticles and metal foam are studied in a triple-tube latent heat storage system (LHS). PCM is enclosed in the middle tube while water passes through the inner and outer tubes as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Different nanoparticles concentrations and metal foam porosities are examined. Different HTF flow directions in the inner and outer tubes related to the gravity direction are assessed. The results show the advantage of the system with counter-current flow of the HTF when the HTF flow in the outer tube is in the gravity direction. By adding 5% copper nanoparticles, the melting/solidification time reduces by 25.9/28.2%. By adding a 95% porous metal foam, the\n2 melting/solidification time reduces by 83.7/88.2% showing the advantage of adding a metal foam compared with adding nanoparticles. Increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles or reducing the porosity of the metal foam reduce the melting/solidification time. Simultaneous usage of the nanoparticles and metal foam show that in the presence of metal foam, the effect of adding nanoparticles is almost negligible. For the porous/nano-PCM case with 95% porosity of the metal foam and 5% volume fraction of nanoparticles, the melting/solidification time reduces by 84.2/88.8 % compared with the pure PCM system. This paper provides a clear and comprehensive vision of the simultaneous effects of different heat transfer enhancement methods inside the PCM in triple-tube LHS systems.

Introduction Energy storage plays a crucial role in saving the excess energy and balance the mismatch between energy supply and energy demand. The high rate of energy waste to the environment in the form of thermal energy can be stored and used efficient which is the major challenge for fossil-fuel usage. Energy storage has been widely used in buildings, power plants and industries recently to provide a more efficient way of energy usage. In buildings, as the most energy consumer in the world which accounts for 36% of the global final energy consumption, energy storage allows peak-shaving and energy saving during the day [1, 2]. For renewable energies such as solar and geothermal, energy storage helps to store a huge amount of energy which is otherwise can be lost [3]. In industries as well as steam and gas power plants, energy storage can save excess energy to produce more power. By saving energy through the use of energy storage, a huge amount of CO2 production can be reduced in the buildings and industries as well as saving more renewable energies [4]. To achieve efficient thermal processes and remarkable energy-saving benefits, novel technologies for energy storage are of great practical importance. Thermal energy storage (TES) has the advantages of peak-shaving, high-efficiency use of energy, heat waste recovery, as well as a higher amount of renewable energy saving [5]. Among different types of TES, latent heat storage (LHS) systems have great potential to provide a costeffective solution for this problem. Phase change materials (PCMs) are used in LHS systems\n4 to store and recover heat. PCMs are also capable to compete with sensible heat storage materials such as MgO in terms of cost per unit kWh, and are far more compact and also cheaper than electrochemical thermal storage. They have an energy density typically 5 to 14 times higher than any rival heat storage systems, and the added advantage of almost constant temperature during the phase changing process [6]. The main challenge for efficient use of PCM based technologies is the long melting/solidification time as well as not efficient storing/releasing heat due to low thermal conductivity and low thermal diffusivity within the bulk PCM [7]. These disadvantages lead to limited use of LHS systems. Different methods are utilized to enhance the rate of heat storage/retrieval including geometry modification [8], use of fins [9], nanoparticles [10], encapsulation [11] and high conductivity porous medium [12]. The use of extra additives such as nanoparticles and a porous medium has the advantage of using with each other or with geometry modification. Pipe heat exchangers are widely used in industries and power plants for heat transfer in the forms of double-tube, triple-tube and multiple-tube. In solar parabolic power plants, they have been used to transfer the solar radiation to a secondary fluid. For the PCM based pipe heat exchangers, the PCM is kept in one side of the pipe while the heat transfer fluid (HTF) stores/recovers heat to/from it. There has been a lot of studies in the literature working on the performance of double-tube LHTES heat exchangers. Due to the limitation of PCMs, they have tried to modify the double-tube geometry by using fins, eccentric pipes, and wavy channels or using an additive such as nanoparticles and metal foams. Agyenim et al. [13] assessed the performance of a double-tube LHS unit employing different numbers of tubes. They presented that the PCM temperature increases using a higher number of tubes. Darzi et al. [14] assessed the charging of PCM in concentric and eccentric cylindrical tubes to analyse the effect of the eccentricity of the inner tube using constant temperature for the inner tube’s wall. They showed that due to the natural convection in the domain, the location of the inner tube affects the\n5 charging time. They presented that the eccentric annulus has less charging time than the concentric annulus and charging time decreases by increasing the eccentricity of the cylinders. One of the methods to improve the rate of charging/discharging in double-tube heat exchangers is increasing the number of pipes results in a triple-tube and multiple-tube heat exchangers. It can enhance the heat transfer area resulting in a higher heat transfer/release rate [15]. It can be combined with different methods such as fins, nano-PCMs and composite porous-PCMs. Esapour et al. [16, 17] studied a multi-tube PCM based heat exchanger and showed that considering the same mass, the PCM melts 29% faster by using four inner tubes compared to a double-tube unit. Abduljalil et al. [18] investigated the effect of longitudinal fin arrangement in a triple-tube cylindrical LHS system on the charging time reduction. They performed an experiment for the case of internal-external fins and conducted numerical simulations for various combinations of fins including internal, external and internal-external as well as fin length and fin thickness. They showed 34.7% reduction in the melting time for the best case. Andrew et al. [19] examined different designs of the LHS heat exchanger including one tube with and without longitudinal and circular fins, and multi-tube configurations. They showed the advantage of multi-tube compared with the single tube heat exchanger. Nanoparticles are widely used to enhance the thermal conductivity of fluids recently. They have been used in LHS systems to solve the problem of low thermal conductivity of PCMs. The use of nanoparticles leads to changes in PCM properties. It generally decreases the fusion latent heat, as well as specific heat transfer coefficient of the PCM, results in the reduction of heat storage capacity and therefore higher amount of PCM mass is required to have an equal heat storage capacity. There has been lots of research in the literature working on the performance of nano-PCM systems [20, 21]. Mahdi and Nsofor [22] investigated the effect of nanoparticles and fins on the solidification rate of PCMs and they found that using fins improves the phase-change rate better than the nanoparticles alone or the combination of both.\n6 Abdollahzadeh and Esmaeilpour [23] employed two different configurations of channel waviness including divergent-convergent and convergent-divergent walls using Cu-water nanofluid in the discharging process. They presented the negative effect of nanoparticles due to the lower latent heat of the nanoPCM and also positive effect of channel waviness. Sushobhan and Kar [24] studied the effect of CuO nanoparticles on the performance of the LHS system using N-Octadecene paraffin as the PCM. They showed the advantage of nanoparticles on the reduction of melting time which is more effective by increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles. Jasim et al. [25] studied on simultaneous charging and discharging from a fined triple-tube LHS system using Al2O3 to enhance the thermal conductivity of PCM. They showed that the effect of adding fins on modifying the performance of the system is much more than that of the nanoparticles. In the composite porous/PCM, the heat is transferred by conduction through the high conductivity porous foam rather than PCM which increases the rate of thermal diffusion [26]. It is shown that the effect of conduction heat transfer by the porous foam is significantly effective on the performance of the charging/discharging process [27]. Zhao et al. [28] studied the effects of metal foam on the performance of RT58 and they stated that the metal foam can enhance the phase-change rate around 10 times depending on the material and the conditions used. Liu et al. [29, 30] studied numerically the melting of a composite metal foam/PCM shell and tube storage in 2-D and 3-D cases. They showed the small effect of pore size on the melting process and the negligible effect of natural convection in the presence of a porous medium. Nithyanandam et al. [31] studied the effect of metal foam on the performance of an LHS system based on the heat pipes. They found that lower pore size improves the rate of heat transfer. Mahdi et al. [25] studied a 2D double-tube LHS system using multiple-segment metal foam with various porosity. They presented that the use of different foam porosity in different segments enhances the rate of heat storage and recovery compared with the single porosity\n7 case. Shahsavar et al. [32] studied the effect of channel waviness in a double-tube heat storage system using a combination of metal foam inside the PCM. They showed more than 90% reduction in both melting and solidification times using composite PCM in the sinusoidal wavy channels in comparison with that for smooth channels case. They also presented a higher rate of heat transfer more than 10/18 times in the charging/discharging process using a composite PCM heat exchanger. Yang et al. [33] studied numerically the effect of porous medium addition in both PCM and HTF domains using a 2-D axisymmetric model. They showed that by employing metal foam in all the domain, compared with the non-porous case, the melting time reduces by almost 88.5% and more uniform temperature is achieved inside the PCM. In another study [34], they showed experimentally that by using metal foam inside the PCM domain, the melting time reduces by 64%. Furthermore, they presented that in the presence of the porous medium, the inclination angle of the energy storage unit has a negligible effect due to dominant effect of the porous medium for conduction heat transfer [35]. Based on the literature review, the lack of comprehensive paper on the effect of nanoparticles in the presence of a porous medium can be seen for the PCM based energy storage systems. Therefore, this study aims to study the combination of porous medium and nanoparticles in a PCM based vertical triple-tube LHS system. The triple-tube latent heat storage system is employed as a more efficient system compared with a double-tube unit. In the triple-tube system, composite PCM is located in the middle tube while water passes in the inner and outer tubes as the heat transfer fluid. Different directions of water flow in the inner and outer tubes including the co-current and counter-current flows are studied which has not been studied previously. The effect of copper nanoparticles, copper foam and simultaneous use of nanoparticles and porous medium are studied comprehensively. The system is analysed in both melting/solidification process based on the melting/solidification time, temperature and rate of heat storage/retrieval. Different volume fractions of nanoparticles, as well as different\n8 porosities of metal foam, are also investigated. The results of this paper provide guidelines for comprehensive usage of different heat transfer enhancement methods in LHS systems including geometry modification, nanoparticles addition and porous medium addition. 2. Mathematical modelling In this study, four different cases are studied including the pure PCM, nano-PCM, porous-PCM and porous/nano-PCM. Without the presence of the porous medium, in the solid estate, heat is transferred by conduction and then after generating liquid phase, heat is transferred by both conduction and natural convection. In the presence of a porous medium, heat is more transferred by conduction through the metal foam inside the PCM rather than low conductivity pure PCM [36]. By adding a porous medium, a part of LHS volume is filled with the porous structure and therefore a higher volume of PCM should be employed to have a similar PCM mass. Furthermore, due to the flow resistance made by the porous structure, the effect of natural convection is negligible in the porous-PCM case [37]. In the presence of nanoparticles inside the pure PCM, the properties of PCM are changed. The purpose of adding nanoparticles is modifying the thermal conductivity of pure PCM; however, the latent heat of fusion and specific heat transfer coefficient reduce while the effective density increases. In numerical modelling, the enthalpy-porosity model is employed for modelling the effect of phase change. The viscous and inertial losses due to the effect of the porous medium should also be considered in the momentum equation [38]. By adding nanoparticles, all the effective properties of pure PCM are determined and employed instead of pure PCM properties in the model. The governing equations for the PCM are defined as follows [40]: Continuity:\n9 ∂\uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D ∂\uD835\uDC61 + ∇.\uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC49 = 0\n(1)\nMomentum:\n\uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D ∂\uD835\uDC49 ∂\uD835\uDC61 + \uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D (\uD835\uDC49.∇)\uD835\uDC49 = ―∇\uD835\uDC43 + \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D(∇2\uD835\uDC49) ― \uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D,\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDF00(\uD835\uDC47 ― \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC53)\uD835\uDC54 ― \uD835\uDC46 ― \uD835\uDC39 (2)\nEnergy:\n\uD835\uDF00∂\uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC5D,\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC47 ∂\uD835\uDC61 + ∇(\uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC5D,\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC47) = ∇(\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC52 ― \uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D∇\uD835\uDC47) ― \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3F (3)\nTwo different thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium can be employed to solve the energy equation for the PCM in the presence of a porous medium. It is true that employing the thermal non-equilibrium model provides a more accurate results compared with the equilibrium model due to considering the local convection heat transfer inside the pores of the porous medium between the metal foam and the PCM; however, the assumption of thermal equilibrium model saves computational resources by maintaining good accuracy as shown in the literature [41, 42]. Furthermore, the difference between the non-equilibrium and equilibrium models depends on the boundary and initial conditions which are significant in the sensible heat domain rather than that during the phase change process due to having an almost constant temperature [30] Furthermore, it is noteworthy that, the non-equilibrium model cannot be used regularly in the 2-D and axisymmetric models, due to generated porous boundaries at the walls between the HTF and the PCM and the limitation of coupled boundary condition for it in FLUENT software [42]. In the local thermal equilibrium condition, the volume average of the thermal conductivities of the porous medium and nano-PCM is considered as the effective thermal conductivity of the porous/nano-PCM given as [30]:\n\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC52 ― \uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D = (1 ― \uD835\uDF00)\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC60 + \uD835\uDF00\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC5D (4)\nThe source terms is given as [43]:\uD835\uDC46\n10\n\uD835\uDC46 = \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC5A (1 ― \uD835\uDF06)2\n\uD835\uDF063 + 0.001 \uD835\uDC49 (5)\nwhere is considered 105 [44-46]. \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC5A It should be noted that for modelling the system without the porous medium, the porosity is set equal to 1 in the Eqs. (2) and (4). For the water as the heat transfer fluid in the inner and outer tubes, the fluid flow is considered incompressible and laminar where the governing equations are the conservations of mass, momentum and energy which are the well-established in the literature [47].

System description\nThe studied LHS unit shown in Fig. 1 is a vertical triple-tube heat storage system with the length of 500 mm, the inner diameter of 4 cm, the middle diameter of 8 cm and the outer diameter of 12 cm. Due to the nature of the geometry and conditions of the problem, the axisymmetric model is employed (shown in Fig. 1(b)) where a rectangular geometry is considered as the computational domain with the left line as the axis of the problem. In the PCM zone, different cases of pure PCM, nano-PCM, porous-PCM and porous/nano-PCM are evaluated. Note that, for different cases, the volume of the unit increases based on the foam porosity and volume fraction of nanoparticles to have a similar PCM mass.\n13\n(a) (b)\nFig. 1. Schematic of the studied triple-tube LHT system.\nWater passes through the inner and outer tubes of the unit while the PCM encloses in the middle tube in the presence of copper foam and copper nanoparticles. The water flow is laminar with the assumption of inlet constant velocity and temperature and outflow outlet. No-slip boundary condition is defined for the walls where the adiabatic condition is assumed except for the middle walls for heat transfer between the water and PCM. Three different cases are existed according to the directions of the water flow and gravity in the triple-tube heat storage system. The cases include the co-current flow, counter-current flow where the inner tube is in the gravity direction and the counter-current flow where the outer tube is in the gravity direction. These cases are displayed in Fig. 2.\n\uD835\uDC54\n\uD835\uDC54\nCounter-current flow: outer flow\nin the gravity direction\nCounter-current flow: Inner flow\nin the gravity direction\nCo-Current flow\nFig. 2. Different conditions for the water flow direction inside the system\nThe initial temperature of the PCM is 285 K in the melting process and 323 K in the solidification process. The temperature of water at the inlet is also considered equal to 323 K and 285 K, respectively, in the melting and solidification processes. The PCM is considered RT-35 (RUBITHERM) and the properties are presented in Table 1. Note that the reference density used in the momentum equation is considered equal to the mean densities of the PCM in the solid and liquid estates (815 kg/m3) at the reference temperature equal to the average temperature between the solidus and liquidus temperatures (305.5 K).

Numerical model and validation\nANSYS-FLUENT software is utilized to discrete the governing equations using the SIMPLE algorithm with double-precision solver. The QUICK scheme is used to calculate the diffusion fluxes and convection for the momentum and energy equations while PRESTO scheme is used for the pressure correction equation [32]. The values for under-relaxation factors are set to 0.3, 0.6, 1 and 0.9 for the pressure, velocity, energy, and liquid fraction, respectively, considering the convergence criteria of 10-6 for all the equations. For the grid independency analysis, three different sizes of the mesh including 72000, 120000 and 180000 elements are studied for the pure PCM case. Table 3 presents the results of melting time and average heat storage rate for different meshes. The maximum difference in the melting\ntime is less than 0.3% between 120000 and 180000 elements. Therefore, 120000 is chosen as the element’s number. Different time step sizes of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 s for the case of 120000 cells are also assessed and no considerable change is shown.\n17\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nPresent results Mat et al.

Results and discussion\nIn the following, first, the effect of water flow direction in the triple-tube heat exchanger is studied in the melting process related to the direction of gravity. After finding the best condition, the effect of the presence of the porous medium, nanoparticles and simultaneous porous medium and nanoparticles are studied during the melting and solidification processes.\n5.1. Effect of water flow direction\n[26]\n19\nThree different cases are existed according to the directions of the water flow and gravity in the triple-tube heat storage system. The cases include the co-current flow, counter-current flow where the inner tube is in the gravity direction and the counter-current flow where the outer tube is in the gravity direction. Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) display the variation of liquid fraction and volume average temperature as a function of time for different cases, respectively. It is worth noting that the volume average temperature is useful to demonstrate the liquid fraction variation in the domain. When the average temperature rises from the solidus temperature, all the PCM places in the phase change process and when the average temperature passes the liquidus temperature, all the PCM melts. The counter-current cases show a higher performance according to the melting time. As shown, in the almost first 1000 s, a higher liquid fraction is achieved for the co-current case. During this time, the mean temperature of the PCM is a little higher for the CO case compared with the CC cases and as a result, a higher liquid fraction is achieved. However, after that, the mean temperature of PCM is higher for the CC cases results in a higher rate of liquid fraction enhancement at the same time compared with the CO case. The reason is that at the beginning of the melting process, the heat is transferred only by conduction. In the CC condition, since the gravity is in the direction of the water flow in one of the tubes, it causes a little less heat transfer from the water to the PCM. Then, after some time when convection is gradually generated in the PCM, the effect of counter-current flow starts helping the domination of convection in the PCM domain results in a higher mean temperature of the PCM and therefore shorter melting time. For all cases, in the beginning, the rate of mean temperature increment is higher until the PCM is placed in the sensible heat section when the temperature rises from 285 K (initial temperature ) to 302 K (solidus temperature). During the phase change process, the rate of mean temperature increment is reduced between 302 K and 309 K (liquidus temperature) since the PCM places in the latent heat section. After the liquidus temperature, a higher rate of temperature increment\n20\nis also achieved since the PCM again places in the sensible heat section. Note that in the counter-current cases, the case which the water flow in outer tube is in the gravity direction shows a negligible higher performance compared with that when the water flow in the inner tube is in the gravity direction at the end of the melting process. It should be noted that the average temperature and liquid fraction are determined by using the volume averaging in the FLUENT software from the selected domain. The volume average temperature is employed as the reason for the advantage and disadvantage of the system during the parametric study which also justifies the variation of liquid fraction.\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\nCO CC - Outer tube in g direction CC-Inner tube in g direction\nTime (s)\nLi qu\nid fr\nac tio\nn\n(a)\n21\n280\n290\n300\n310\n320\n330\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\nCO CC - Outer tube in g direction CC-Inner tube in g direction\nTime (s)\nM ea\nn te\nm pe\nra tu\nre (K\n)\n(b)\nFig. 6.

Higher values of PCM temperature at different times can be seen for the counter-current flow system compared with the co-current flow system (shown in Fig. 7(b)) which results in higher values of melted PCM. Furthermore, due to the effect of gravity, natural convection occurred in the PCM domain after the initial moments when the mechanism of heat transfer is just conduction. Therefore, in addition to the melting in the near-wall region, natural convection helps PCM melting by circulating the liquid PCM. As shown in the temperatures contour plots, the dominating natural convection shows a higher temperature at a fixed point on the top portion, while poor conduction causes a weak temperature rise at a point in the bottom portion when heated from the sides. As shown, for the CC case, natural convection is more effecting due to counter-current directions of the HTF flow causing a higher temperature at a fixed point compared with the CO case at different times. For example, at the time of 1800 s as shown in Fig. 7(b), a higher portion of the domain\n22\nat the top of the unit has a higher temperature in the CC case compared with the CO case results in a higher melted PCM in the region as shown in Fig. 7(a). Finally, the PCM melting then terminates from the bottom of the unit at the end.\n600 s 1200 s 1800 s 2400 s 3000 s CC CO CC CO CC CO CC CO CC CO\n(a)\n600 s 1200 s 1800 s 2400 s 3000 s CC CO CC CO CC CO CC CO CC CO\n23\n(b)\nFig. 7. The contour plot of PCM a) liquid fraction and b) temperature for counter-current flow case compared with the co-current case in the melting process\nFor better understanding the effect of natural convection, Fig. 8 display the velocity vectors in the PCM zone at the time of 1800 s in the counter-current flow case. Due to natural convection and direction of gravity, the flow is circulated inside the PCM from bottom to the top near the wall and then from top to the bottom at the centre. A smaller vortex is generated at the top of the domain where the PCM is entirely at the liquid state due to different directions of the HTF in the triple-tube heat storage unit.\n24\nFig. 9 illustrates the variation of the outlet temperatures of water from the inner and outer tubes as a function of time for the counter-current flow case. The outlet temperature of the passing water in the inner tube shows a lower temperature compared with that for the outer tube temperature which means that a higher amount of heat is transferred to the PCM from the inner tube rather than the outer one. The reason is due to the higher surface area of the outer tube compared with the inner tube between the PCM and the HTF which causes a higher area for heat transfer and since the inlet temperature of the HTF in the inner and outer tubes are similar, the outlet temperature of the HTF in the outer tube is higher than that for the inner tube. After 3000 s, the outlet temperatures of the water in the inner and outer tubes are almost the same. Note that the inlet temperature of the water is 323 K and the outlet temperature shows a maximum variation of 3 K at the initial moments and then the difference reduces since the amount of solid PCM reduces.\n25\n320\n321\n322\n323\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\nOuter tube water Inner tube water\nTime (s)\nM ea\nn te\nm pe\nra tu\nre (K\n)\nFig. 9.

      "heading" : "4.1. Effect of the porous medium presence",
      "text" : "In contrast to the pure PCM system which natural convection is the main heat transfer mechanism after the initial pure conduction, the presence of metal foam causes that the heat is transferred by conduction through the high conductivity porous medium rather than low conductivity PCM which increases the effective thermal conductivity and rate of thermal diffusion. Furthermore, due to the flow resistance made by the porous structure, the effect of natural convection is suppressed in the porous-PCM case. For the porous-PCM case, three different porosities of 95, 97 and 99% are studied compared with the pure PCM system and as mentioned the volume of the unit is expanded to have a same mass for the PCMs in different units. Note that the pore size is considered constant equal to 30 PPI in this study for all the porous cases since it was shown in the literature that the effect of pore size is negligible in the metal foam-PCM applications [30].\n26\nFig. 10 illustrates the contour plot of the liquid fraction at 100 s time interval for the porousPCM unit with the porosity of 95% compared with the pure PCM system in the melting process. Due to the higher rate of heat transfer in the porous-PCM case, PCM melts more quickly. After 600 s, the PCM entirely melts in the porous-PCM unit while a huge amount of PCM is still in the solid-state in the pure PCM case. In the porous-PCM unit, since the heat is transferred quickly in the entire PCM domain by conduction through the metal foam, PCM melts uniformly in all the domain. For example, after 200 s, the liquid fraction of the PCM at the centre of the unit is almost 0.3 while it is 1 for the pure PCM case which means that the heat is not transferred to the centre of the domain. The higher temperature of the water at the inlet of the tubes causes a higher liquid fraction at the top and bottom of the unit which is more at the top due to small effect of natural convection in the presence of the porous medium.\n100 s 200 s 300 s 400 s 500 s 600 s Porous PCM pure PCM Porous PCM pure PCM Porous PCM pure PCM Porous PCM pure PCM Porous PCM pure PCM Porous PCM pure PCM\n27\nFig. 11 illustrates the contour plot of temperature distribution for the porous-PCM unit with the porosity of 95% compared with the pure PCM case in the melting process. The more uniform temperature distribution is shown for the porous-PCM case due to the effect of metal foam at the beginning through the end of the process. For the pure PCM system, almost after 400s, the temperature of the PCM is almost uniform when the PCM is placed in the melting point temperature showing the starting of the phase change process. Furthermore, due to the higher rate of heat transfer from the water to the PCM, higher values of the temperature is shown in the porous-PCM case compared with the pure PCM system.\n100s 200s 300s 400s 500s 600s\nPorous\nPCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM\n28\nFig. 12(a) and 12(b) show the variation of PCM average temperature and liquid fraction as a function of time for the porous-PCM case with different porosities compared with the pure PCM system in the melting process. Higher values of temperature and liquid fraction can be seen for the porous-PCM case at the equivalent time compared with the pure PCM system. Furthermore, reducing the porosity results in a higher amount of metal foam in the domain which increases the rate of heat transfer due to a higher effective thermal conductivity of the PCM which equals to 19.57, 11.82 and 4.07 W/mK for the porosities of 0.95, 0.97 and 0.99%, respectively, according to the Eq. (4). Therefore, a higher temperature is achieved using a lower porosity in the porous-PCM case which results in a higher liquid fraction.\n29\n285\n295\n305\n315\n325\n335\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\nPorous-PCM (95%) Porous-PCM (97%) Porous-PCM (99%) PCM only\nTime (s)\nM ea\nn Te\nm pe\nra tu\nre (K\n)\n(a)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000\nPorous-PCM (95%) Porous-PCM (97%) Porous-PCM (99%) PCM only\nTime (s)\nLi qu\nid fr\nac tio\nn\n(b)\nTable 4 summarizes the melting time, the percentage of time-saving compared to the pure PCM unit, the amount of stored energy on the PCM and the rate of heat storage in the melting process. Note that the stored or released thermal energy is calculated based on the results of total energy difference in the domain obtained from FLUENT software from the initial until the end of the melting process and a little difference between the data presented in Table 4 is due to the\ndifference between the end temperature of different case results is a different sensible heat stored in the PCM. The rate of heat storage is significantly higher for the porous-PCM cases compared with the pure PCM unit. Furthermore, reducing the porosity results in an increase in the rate of heat transfer and therefore higher heat storage rate is achieved. The rate of heat storage for the porosity of 95% is almost 2.4% and 12.9% higher than the porosity of 97% and 99%, respectively. It should be noted that, by reducing the porosity and the existence of more metals in the domain, a higher rate of heat transfer occurs which results in a shorter melting time. On the other hand, by reducing the porosity and therefore reducing the volume of PCM, the dimensions of the unit is increased to have a similar PCM mass in different cases for the meaningful comparison which results in a higher melting time. Therefore, due to the significant advantages of high conductivity metal foams rather than a small enhancement in the storage size, by reducing the porosity, the melting time always decreases; however, the rate of reduction in the melting time decreases and therefore the difference between the melting times for the porous-PCM cases with 0.95% and 0.97% porosity are less than that for the cases of 97% and 0.99%. Furthermore, it depends on various effective parameters such as boundary conditions, materials of the PCM and porous medium, operating conditions of the PCM and HTF and finally the dimensions of the geometry.\n31\nFig. 13a) and 13(b) display the contour plots of liquid fraction and temperature distribution for the porous-PCM unit with the porosity of 95% compared with the pure PCM system in the solidification process. Similar to the melting process, a higher rate of heat transfer can be seen for the porous PCM case results in a lower temperature (Fig. 13(b)) and consequently a lower liquid fraction (Fig. 13(a)) at an equivalent time.\n100s 200s 300s 400s 500s 600s\nPorous\nPCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM Porous PCM\nPure PCM\n(a)\n32\n100s 200s 300s 400s 500s 600s Porous PCM Pure PCM Porous PCM Pure PCM Porous PCM Pure PCM Porous PCM Pure PCM Porous PCM Pure PCM Porous PCM Pure PCM\n(b)\nFig. 13.

In the melting process, the thermal conductivity is almost 0.232 W/mK at the initial temperature (285 K) instead of 0.2 W/Mk for the pure PCM. By increasing the temperature from 285 K to 323 K, the thermal conductivity increases to 0.261 W/mK. On the other hand, in the solidification process, the thermal conductivity reduces from\n36\n0.261 W/mK at the temperature of 323 K to 0.232 W/mK at the temperature of 285 K. Since, in the beginning, higher amount of PCM places at the initial state and the heat is transferred by conduction, the higher values of thermal conductivities are more pronounced and therefore the presence of nanoparticles are more effective during the solidification process rather than melting process.\n37\nTable 6 summarizes the melting/solidification time, the percentage of time-saving compared to the pure PCM unit, the amount of energy stored/released in/from the PCM and rate of heat storage/retrieval. The melting and solidification times for the nano-PCM with 5% nanoparticles enhances by 25.87% and 28.22%, respectively, compared with the pure PCM system due to the enhancement in the rate of heat storage and retrieval by 39.5% and 42.4%, respectively. As mentioned, during the solidification, the presence of nanoparticles causes higher time saving compared with the melting process. It should be noted that by adding the nanoparticles, the amount of energy stored/released in/from the PCM increases a little showing a positive advantage of adding nanoparticles to the PCM in addition to a higher melting/solidification time.\nTable 6.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, the effects of separate and simultaneous usage of nanoparticles and metal foam in a triple-tube latent heat storage system were studied. PCM is enclosed in the middle tube while water flows in the inner and outer tubes to release/gain heat to/from the PCM during the melting/solidification process. The effects of flow direction, the volume fraction of nanoparticles and the porosity of metal foam were investigated based on the melting and solidification times as well as the rate of heat storage/recovery. Copper is used as the material of nanoparticles and metal foam. It can be concluded that the counter-current flows of the HTF when the outer flow is in the gravity direction shows lower melting and solidification time\n42\ncompared with the co-current HTF flows. Adding both nanoparticles and metal foam reduces the time of melting and solidification by improving the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM. However, in the presence of the metal foam, nanoparticles show a negligible effect on the performance of the system. In the presence of 95% porosity metal foam without nanoparticles, the melting and solidification time reduce by 83.7% and 88.2%, respectively, compared with that for the pure PCM system; while for the case of metal foam/nano-PCM with 5% nanoparticles and 95% porosity metal foam, the melting and solidification times reduce by 2.7% and 4.7%, respectively, compared with that for the metal foam-PCM system with 95% porosity. The results of this paper provide guidelines for simultaneous usage of nanoparticles, metal foams and geometry modification in the composite LHS systems to take one step forward toward commercialized usage of PCM based energy storage systems.\n7.

PCM is enclosed in the middle tube while water passes through the inner and outer tubes as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Different nanoparticles concentrations and metal foam porosities are examined. Different HTF flow directions in the inner and outer tubes related to the gravity direction are assessed. The results show the advantage of the system with counter-current flow of the HTF when the HTF flow in the outer tube is in the gravity direction. By adding 5% copper nanoparticles, the melting/solidification time reduces by 25.9/28.2%. By adding a 95% porous metal foam, the",
