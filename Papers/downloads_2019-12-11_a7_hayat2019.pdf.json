      "text" : "Figure 6. (a) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the as-synthesized Ni(OH)2 and (b) NiO working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode.\nElectrochemical measurements.—The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of Ni(OH)2 and NiO based electrodes were measured in 1M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) solution at various scan rate. The concentration of glucose in the electrolyte solution was 0.3 mM initially and hence it has been deducted that NiO based electrode (Fig. 6a) exhibits a pair of well resolved couple redox peaks e.g. cathodic peak and anodic peak at + 0.38 V and + 0.47 V respectively,67 while the Ni(OH)2 represent a poor CV result under the same experimental condition as shown in Fig. 6b. Similarly after the initial scan deduction, the concentration of glucose proceed to be higher for the detection of glucose under Ni(OH)2 electrode to see its comparison and sensing performance in front of NiO based electrode. Similarly, it was declared that NiOelectrode exhibit a better electrochemical performance and glucose detection than Ni(OH)2as manifested in Fig. 6b inset. Furthermore the cathodic and anodic peaks relocated toward the negative and positive pole and improved with the increment in scan rate.68,69 Hence, it indicates the qusielectron transfer reaction for the aforementioned electrochemical reaction.\nGlucose sensing measurement.—The electrochemical behavior of NiO and Ni(OH)2 electrodes for the oxidation of glucose was measured by cyclic voltammetry in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous solution by injecting different concentration of glucose. Initially, the experiment was conducted without the addition of glucose concentration and hence no detection occurs which reveal the catalytic activeness of the electrode for detection of glucose. For comparison, the electrochemical behavior of as-constructed Ni(OH)2 sample was measured under the same experimental conditions as shown in Fig. 7a. There is no appreciable oxidative currents were detected even when the concentration of glucose in the electrolyte solution was raised up to (0.9–1.108 mM) as illustrated in Fig. 7b inset. The results indicate that Ni(OH)2 show poor activity toward the oxidation of glucose. Similarly, when concentration of glucose raised toward 0.9 mM, then the cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the NiO working electrode exhibited an enhanced oxidative current and reach up to 12 μA (Fig. 7b). The oxidation of glucose starts at around 0.38 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode and as the concentration of glucose increased from 0.0554 mM to 0.3 mM and finally 0.9 mM then the oxidative currents increased from 8 to 12 μA\nFigure 7.

(b) The plot of the slope of straight lines against the Sg concentration.\nrespectively. The enhancement of anodic current is ascribed to the electro-oxidation of glucose by utilizing NiO as an electrocatalyst.70\nDetermination of electrochemical active surface area.—It was known that; the electrode reaction rates and most double layer parameters are widespread extents and have to be considered to the unit area of the interface and hence, the desire knowledge of the real surface area of electrodes is therefore needed.71 To measure the electrochemically active surface areas of the modified electrode, then chronoamprogram of 0.2 mM potassium ferrocyanide as the redox probe was recorded. In this test, the current for the electrochemical reaction of ferrocyanide (at a mass transfer-limited rate) that diffuse to an electrode surface is described by the Cottrell equation.72\ni = nFAD1/2C∗/π1/2t1/2 Where, A is the electrochemical active area, D is the diffusion coefficient, C∗ is the bulk concentration of ferrocyanide and other parameters have been their usual meaning.\nWe have obtained chronoamprogram at a fixed potential of 0.929 V over 50 s in B-R buffer (pH = 7.0) containing different concentrations of NiO (Fig. 8a). Underneath diffusion control, a plot of I vs t1/2 will be liner and from the slope, D values were estimated from the above equation, the value of A can be obtained, since the precise value of the diffusion coefficient of ferrocyanide is well known (6.20 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). The slopes of the resulting straight lines were then plotted vs the NiO concentration (Fig. 8b), from whose slope an average value of D = 2.7 × 10–6 cm2s−1 was obtained. The electrochemically active area of the NiO film was 0.091 cm2. The results showed that the electron transfer is a diffusion-controlled process and the obtained diffusion coefficient value is in good agreement with reported values of diffusion coefficient.\nAmperometric detection of the glucose selectivity and stability.— The applied potential is expected to greatly effects on the electrochemical biosensor of amperometric response and thus for constant potential chrono-amperometry at low potential were performed to investigate the selectivity, sensitivity, stability and reusability of desired electrodes respectively.73 Selectivity and low potential response are the significant characteristics of high-performance non-enzymatic glucose biosensor. Initially, we performed experiments by the convolution of low concentration of glucose to the electrolyte solution at low potential current as shown in Fig. 9a. The time response and selectivity of NiO electrode toward the glucose were measured using chrono-amperometric measurements in 1M Na2SO4 solution containing 0.6 mM uric acid and 0.3 mM of glucose by multiple measurements. The NiO electrode manifested a very sharp response at a potential of 0.38 V by registering a current peak of magnitude around 0.30 mA. As comparison, the uric acid does not indicate any current response. The reusability and stability of the electrode was checked\nby chrono-amperometry after eight days and the same response was observed as presented in Fig. 9a. This indicates that NiO based sensor demonstrated a long-term stability and quick response toward glucose sensing. Fig. 9b announced a continuous stable amperometric response of the non-enzymatic glucose sensors toward successive increase of 1 or 8 μM glucose concentration. The electrodes immediately started the detection of glucose after its injection into the solution and gradually extended its detection level in less than 8 sec. In comparison, the same electrode utilized under same condition after one week for the detection of glucose and juxtaposed with the amperometric response of Ni(OH)2 since NiO based electrode exhibit better performance. These results manifested that NiO electrodes have a momentous catalytic ability to detect the glucose concentration in a rapid response having good selectivity/sensitivity, good stability as a non-enzymatic sensor under the prescribed potential. Furthermore, the amperometric response of NiO toward glucose sensor was examined in 1M Na2SO4aqueous solution by applying 3 μA current as shown in Fig. 9c. During the injection of different molar concentration of glucose to the desired electrolyte, the NiO demonstrates a quick regular response for various concentration of glucose with sensitivity of 49.9 nA/μM and regression coefficient (R) value of 0.997. Further, the NiO electrode has linear response in between 0.1 μM and 8 mM for glucose concentration. Within this limit, an appropriate detection of 1μM quick response in less than 12 sec has been noticed.\nSimilarly, the overall comparison of different non-enzymatic and enzymatic techniques for the detection of glucose concentration on basis of sensitivity, detection limit and the response time are synopsized in Table I in detail. Hence, the reported data for the design of NiO based electrode demonstrating a superior quick response with high speed, lower detection limit, long durable stability, high sensitivity and selectivity toward the glucose oxidation as compared with previous reports.\nInterference investigations of the NiO sensor for glucose detection.—At initially, the interference (selectivity) of NiO based glucose sensor was inspected by the addition of 0.6mM of dopamine (DA), 0.6 mM of ascorbic acid (AA), 0.6 mM of ethanol (EtOH), 0.6 mM of uric acid (UA) and also the addition of 0.3mM of glucose concentration under same condition by applied given potential. The results demonstrate that detection of glucose concentration is very sharp and extremely higher than that of DA, AA, ETOH and UA and also investigated the current given to experiments (Fig. 10a and 10b).\nSecondly, the anti-interference of NiO sensor toward 0.3 mM glucose was also determined by comparing with other monosaccharide’s containing components such as the addition of 0.6 mM sorbitol, 0.6 mM maltose, 0.6 mM fructose and 0.6 mM lactose at given time and potential84 as illustrated in Fig. 10c and 10d. The above results clearly depicting that the level of current response and selectivity\n) unless CC License in place (see abstract). ecsdl.org/site/terms_use address.

The results also reveal a sharp detection and sensitivity of NiO sensor toward glucose detection even by addition of twice amount of interferents and anti-interferents to the electrolyte at the same condition as discussed above. The final conclusion contemplated the NiO based sensor as a highly sensitive,\nselectivity and hasty current response for the detection of glucose in aqueous solution.\nReproducibility and stability.—To ensure the reproducibility of NiO based non-enzymatic glucose sensor, six electrodes were assembled and evaluated their amperometric response by the inclusion of\nTable I.

The Fig. 9b clearly demonstrated the normal sensitivity of NiO based sensor electrode for the detection of glucose over a period of 20 days.\nThe experiment represents the minimum declination of sensitivity during the redox process (based on stored condition). The first detection toward glucose oxidation has been held immediately and second were noticed after the utilized electrodes were stored in two sections, (open air and in 0.1 M of NaOH solution) after washing properly.\nAfter every four days, the detection response of electrodes for glucose oxidation approximately decrease up to 52% (stored in 0.1 M NaOH solution) and as such of 83% as being stored in open air therefore indicating the long durability of NiO electrode when it stored in NaOH solution. The NiO based electrodes predicted a favorable morphologies and maximum number of active sites for the mass transfer and electro-oxidation of glucose during electrochemical analysis."

This synthesis procedure provides highly stable and adherent nanostructured films of thickness around 3 microns. The black colored NiO obtained after the annealing of green colored Ni(OH)2 therefore demonstrate a high sensitivity, fast response, and excellent stability for non-enzymatic detection of glucose concentration levels. The simple synthetic procedure with low cost and enhances electrocatalytic performance can potentially pave the way for the fabrication of inexpensive, effective and highly sensitive glucose sensors due to the large contact area of the electrolyte with the highly porous electrode materials."

    "abstractText" : "Electrochemical measurements.—The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of Ni(OH)2 and NiO based electrodes were measured in 1M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) solution at various scan rate. The concentration of glucose in the electrolyte solution was 0.3 mM initially and hence it has been deducted that NiO based electrode (Fig. 6a) exhibits a pair of well resolved couple redox peaks e.g. cathodic peak and anodic peak at + 0.38 V and + 0.47 V respectively,67 while the Ni(OH)2 represent a poor CV result under the same experimental condition as shown in Fig. 6b. Similarly after the initial scan deduction, the concentration of glucose proceed to be higher for the detection of glucose under Ni(OH)2 electrode to see its comparison and sensing performance in front of NiO based electrode. Similarly, it was declared that NiOelectrode exhibit a better electrochemical performance and glucose detection than Ni(OH)2as manifested in Fig. 6b inset. Furthermore the cathodic and anodic peaks relocated toward the negative and positive pole and improved with the increment in scan rate.68,69 Hence, it indicates the qusielectron transfer reaction for the aforementioned electrochemical reaction. Glucose sensing measurement.—The electrochemical behavior of NiO and Ni(OH)2 electrodes for the oxidation of glucose was measured by cyclic voltammetry in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous solution by injecting different concentration of glucose. Initially, the experiment was conducted without the addition of glucose concentration and hence no detection occurs which reveal the catalytic activeness of the electrode for detection of glucose. For comparison, the electrochemical behavior of as-constructed Ni(OH)2 sample was measured under the same experimental conditions as shown in Fig. 7a. There is no appreciable oxidative currents were detected even when the concentration of glucose in the electrolyte solution was raised up to (0.9–1.108 mM) as illustrated in Fig. 7b inset. The results indicate that Ni(OH)2 show poor activity toward the oxidation of glucose. Similarly, when concentration of glucose raised toward 0.9 mM, then the cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the NiO working electrode exhibited an enhanced oxidative current and reach up to 12 μA (Fig. 7b). The oxidation of glucose starts at around 0.38 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode and as the concentration of glucose increased from 0.0554 mM to 0.3 mM and finally 0.9 mM then the oxidative currents increased from 8 to 12 μA",
