However, the impact of nano-pesticides on biodiversity is still lacking clear research. We discuss here whether the use of nano-pesticides is a great challenge for biodiversity.\n© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nntroduction\nIn recent years, with the rapid development of nanotechnology 1–5] and the increasingly prominent problems of food shortges and pesticide pollution in the world [6–10], nano-pesticides ave become a hot research topic. Nano-pesticides are a new and ore efficient pesticide product which mainly refer to the fol-\nowing two types of pesticides. The first type of nano-pesticides efers to pesticides whose effective ingredients are nano-sized. his kind of pesticides usually include powder pesticides and ano dispersant/(micro) emulsion pesticides [11–13]. The second ype of nano-pesticides refers to the pesticides that are loaded ith nanomaterials or doped in nanomaterials, or directly coated ith nanomaterials to put a “nano-coat” on their surface. Nano-\nomponents in this kind of pesticides usually have the functions f improving the performance of efficient components of original esticides, targeting transportation, protecting pesticides and conrolling the release of pesticides [14–20]. Nano-pesticides exhibited\ndvantages over traditional pesticides such as low-volume usage nd high efficiency. Traditional pesticides have coarse drug carier particles, poor dispersibility, poor stability and low biological\n∗ Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: mchensn@hnu.edu.cn (M.

However, for nano-pesticides, the smaller the particle size of nano-pesticides is, the more evenly they are distributed on crop leaves, and the higher their efficacy is. In addition, the nano-carriers of pesticides can not only improve pesticides’ dispersibility and stability, but also facilitate the effective ingredients of pesticides to the targeted organisms so as to improve their bioavailability [20,25–29]. These advantages could make up for the shortcomings of large dosage and low efficiency of traditional pesticides in practical applications. Therefore, nano-pesticides have been widely applied. For example, the “Diyarex Gold” nano-pesticide developed using nanotechnology is now on the market. It is used as an antiseptic against powdery mildew and rust of various plants [30]. Conventional glyphosate herbicides have also been developed into nanoemulsions to improve weeding efficiency [12]. Metal nanoparticles are also commonly used as pesticides to control plant diseases and insect pests. Among them, copper nanoparticles are commonly used as fungicides to control fruit tree’ diseases [31], and silver nanoparticles are also commonly used as agents to resist plant fungal pathogens [32–34]. However, research on the environmental risks of nano-pesticides is still far behind the development of their application. Considering the persistence, high durability or reactivity of certain nano-pesticides, the combined toxicity of\nnanomaterials and pesticide [35], and the connectivity of the entire ecosystem [36–38], we believe that nano-pesticides could have a significant impact on biodiversity.\n2 Y. Sun, J. Liang, L. Tang et al. / Nano Today 28 (2019) 100757\ne a gr\nN\no N w c s t t c i u [ m e m s i i a i fi c P t u a n c t t\nT\ni s i m a i [ d w C p g t n\nano-pesticides for the control of targeted organisms\nThere is no doubt that nano-pesticides could significantly reduce r even eliminate the number of targeted organisms [29,39–42]. ano-imidacloprid generally refers to the imidacloprid pesticides rapped in nano-coat [43,44]. Common imidacloprid pesticides\nan specifically block the micro-energy neural pathway of pests, o as to achieve the purpose of insecticidal [45–47]. For the effecive components of imidacloprid, the nano-coat can protect it from he influence of external factors, improve its biological activity and ontrol its release, thus greatly improving the insecticidal effect of midacloprid [43,44,48]. At present, nano- imidacloprid is widely sed to control rice planthoppers, aphids and other sucking insects 49]. Studies have shown that nano-imidacloprid is significantly\nore toxic to Martianus dermestoides that of adult stage than genral pesticides [40]. Nano-silica is a kind of ultrafine inorganic aterial with particle size ranging from 1 to 100 nm, due to its\nmall size effect, surface effect and macroscopic quantum tunnelng effect, it exhibits many unique properties and is widely used n catalysis, light absorption, medicine and other fields [50–54]. In ddition, the toxic effect of nano-silica on insects and microorgansms also leads to the gradual expansion of its application in the eld of pesticides [55]. The experiment showed that nano-silica ould significantly reduce the amount of Spodoptera littoralis [41]. aulraja et al. [42] prepared a kind of nano chitosan and combined his kind nano chitosan with a botanical pesticide PONNEEM® by sing tripolyphosphate and glutaraldehyde as crosslinking agent, nd then they got the CSNs - the TPP - PONNEEM compound ano-pesticide. They found that when the CSNs TPP - PONNEEM’ oncentration in aqueous solution was 0.3%, 90.2% of targeted creaures can be killed. The effect of this nano-pesticide is much higher han ordinary PONNEEM®.\nhe harm of nano-pesticides to non-targeted organisms\nAlthough the utilization rate of nano-pesticides has been greatly mproved compared with traditional pesticides [56–58], there are till about 60% of nano-pesticides cannot act on targeted organsms [59]. In addition, most of the emulsifiable concentrates and\nicroemulsions used in nano-pesticides are polar solvents such s benzenes, alcohols and ketones, which have high acute toxicty and easily find their way into the farmland and groundwater 60–63]. Polar solvents entering the environment are not easy to egrade and will accumulate in the environment, which could idely cause acute poisoning and even death of animals [64–66]. onsidering that the nano-pesticides have smaller size, stronger\nenetrating power to cells, and easier access to targeted microoranisms than conventional pesticides, we have to put forward he following doubts: Compared with common pesticides, are ano-pesticides scattered in the environment more likely to enter\neat challenge for biodiversity.\nnon-targeted organisms and have unpredictable consequences for the non-targeted organisms? In the agricultural production process, nano-TiO2 pesticides can kill beneficial bacteria while killing harmful bacteria [67]. In addition, while killing targeted organisms, green-synthesized CdS nano-pesticides can also kill a large number of non-targeted aquatic organisms such as river crabs [39]. Undoubtedly, harmful substances of nano-pesticides remaining in edible plants and animals are likely to enter the human body through the food chain and thus endanger human health.\nThe combined toxicity of nanomaterials and pesticides is unclear\nFinally, what combined toxicity of nanomaterials and pesticides can produce and what effects of these combined toxicity have on organisms are still poorly studied. Thus we have to raise concerns about this issue, because its potential impact on the environment and humans is far-reaching.\nConclusion\nBased on the above statements, we are very concerned that nano-pesticides could have an unavoidable impact on biodiversity (Fig. 1).\nWhile developing nanotechnology and agricultural technology, we should consider the impacts of these technologies on the entire ecology. At present, the risk assessment procedures of traditional pesticides cannot make a reasonable and comprehensive assessment of the environmental risks of nano-pesticides. Because the nano components contained in nano-pesticides are extremely small, and the additives in nano-pesticides which do not exist in common pesticides are generally highly toxic. In addition, the combined toxicity of nanomaterials and common pesticide ingredients is also very complicated. The environmental risk assessment procedure of nano-pesticides needs to be established urgently.\nAcknowledgments\nThe study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51521006), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-13R17), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (531107051161, 531118010167), Training Program for Excellent Young Innovators of Changsha (kq1802010, kq1802040), Science and Technology Planning Project of Hunan Province, China (2018RS3109, 2017WK2021), the Technical Innovation Project\n(Major Project) of Hubei Province, China (2016ACA176), Science and Technology Research Project of Hubei Provincial Education Department, China (Q20164507) and Scientific Research Project of Hubei Polytechnic University (16xjz04R).\n. / Nan\nR\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [ [ [\n[\n[\n[ [\n[ [ [\n[ [ [\n[ [\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\n[\n[ [ [\n[ [ [\n[ [ [\n[\n[ [\n[ [ [\n[\n[\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\n[\n[\n[ [\n[\nY.
