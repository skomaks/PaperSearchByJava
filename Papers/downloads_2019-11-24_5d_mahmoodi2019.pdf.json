      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "One of the vital abiotic factors of the ecosystem for any living biological entity is water. In recent times, the main environmental problem is organic contaminants including dyes, which have been found in industrial effluents [1–5]. Textile industries use dyes and generate the large volume of contaminated effluents. The discharged wastewater contains chemicals such as dyes spread into the natural waterway from industries including a tannery, textile, paper, leather, plastics, and cosmetics. Because of the step being polluted and colored, the wastewater is highly visible and alter the environmental aesthetics. Dyes have different chromophoric groups such as oxazine, phthalocyanine, azo, anthraquinone, and formazan which can be categorized into three major classes including cationic, nonionic and anionic dyes. Also, they have different absorption bands in absorption spectra [6–12].\nThe adsorption process is an attractive technique for removing contaminants due to its high efficiency with low adsorbent dosage and process time [13–19]. Magnetically assisted separation is an efficient method for separating adsorbents from water and wastewater. The using magnetic field with low intensity induces the material magnetization and makes the application of magnetic force possible. The adsorbent magnetization was removed in the absence of magnetic field. It is an important property for separating adsorbent particles from aqueous media after pollutant removal process. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are attracted much attention as unique adsorbent materials due to their unique properties and structure. The CNT is a rolled up graphitic sheet into a cylindrical shape [20]. It can be magnetized by the synthesis of its composite with iron oxide. The magnetic CNTs have various applications in different fields including magnetic data storage, separation, etc. They can be prepared by the Fenton’s reagent procedure. In this method, H2O2 was slowly added to FeSO4 solution containing CNT. The oxidant converted Fe(II) to Fe(III) and generated functional groups on the CNT. The Fe2O3 nanoparticle was uniformly produced after heat treatment on the CNT surface with high loading without the addition of any cations. It was dispersed on the CNT surface without any pretreatment such as strong acid or covalent functionalization processes [2].\nRecently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained significant attraction for their high pollutants removal ability [21–36]. They are used in different areas including pollutant removal, sensor, photocatalysis, separation and membranes and turn into one of the generally broadly debated issues in heterogeneous catalysis [37–39]. The magnetic composites of MOFs can be synthesized using iron oxide materials to separate from wastewater easily. The ZIF as a MOF is a thermally and chemically stable material. The ZIF-8 is synthesized using methyl imidazole as an organic linker and zinc nitrate as a metal nude. It has a sodalite zeolitic structure with pore size of 1.1 nm and pore window of 0.34 nm [40]. ZIF-8 was used as an adsorbent for removing contaminants from liquid phase [41–48].\nA Literature review indicated that dye removal by magnetic amine functionalized carbon nanotube (NH2-CNT/Fe2O3)-zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) nanocomposites (NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8: NCFZ) was not studied in details. Herein, an easy procedure for preparing magnetic CNT was used without the addition of any cations. The preference of this method is the production of magnetic CNT without the using of strong acids or the formation of covalent bonds. The NCFZ with different amounts of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 (5, 10 and 15wt% denoted as NCFZ5, NCFZ-10, and NCFZ-15) were synthesized. The synthesized nanomaterials including ZIF-8, CNT/Fe2O3, NH2-CNT/Fe2O3, NCFZ-5, NCFZ-10, and NCFZ-15 were characterized using BET, TEM, XRD, SEM, FTIR, VSM and zeta potential. They were applied for selective removing MG (C23H25ClN2) and RhB (C28H31ClN2O3) dyes (Fig. 1) from binary systems. The response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for optimizing dye removal."

      "text" : "The SEM of the synthesized materials were indicated in Fig. 3. The bare CNT is presented with cylindrical morphology. Also, Fig. 3 indicates that the Fe2O3 has no definite size or shape. The image of CNT/ Fe2O3 shows that NH2-CNT surface has been coated by Fe2O3. It can be seen that a little accumulation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles is observed among nanotubes. Fig. 3c and d indicate that the CNT/Fe2O3 and NH2CNT/Fe2O3 constitute small iron oxide aggregated particles with no definite size or shape which is in agreement with previous published work [50]. Also, functionalization of CNT with Fe2O3 did not significantly change its morphology. Fig. 3e indicates a regular dodecahedron crystal structure for ZIF-8, which is in agreement with the published paper [51]. The morphological difference between the samples of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 is further studied by the SEM. It can be concluded from Fig. 3 that the NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 in NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 was separately mixed in ZIF-8. In addition, some ZIF-8 grows on the NH2CNT/Fe2O3 surface as shown in Fig. 3, which makes that the ZIF-8 is linked to NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 giving bunch-like morphology for NH2-CNT/ Fe2O3/ZIF-8 [52]. Also, Fig. 3(j) shows the TEM image of NH2-CNT/ Fe2O3/ZIF8 as a uniformly produced nanomaterial.\nThe incorporation of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 affects on the MOF nucleation and growth. It provides a platform for the crystal growth. In addition, the further MOF growth was reduced by the amine groups of NH2-CNT/ Fe2O3 via coordination. Fig. 4 shows the infra-red spectral profile of the synthesized materials. The peak at the 2900–2800 cm−1 region is due\nto CeH bonds of CNT [53]. The FTIR spectrum results further verify the functionalization of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 (Fig. 4). The vibration of the carbon skeleton of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 along with the peak of C]O stretching at 1633 cm−1. In the Fe2O3 spectrum, the peak at 541 cm−1 was attributed to FeeO stretching [54,55]. Fig. 4 indicates the bands at 3135 and 2926 cm−1 are the CeH stretching of the methyl group and the imidazole ring, respectively. The peak at 1574 cm−1 is due to C]N axial deformation. The peaks at 1307, 1421 and 1456 cm−1 were the characteristic stretching of imidazole [51,56,57]. Also, the peaks at 753 and 689 cm−1 were assigned to the vibrations of Zn-O and Zn-N in MOF. Fig. 4 indicates that these characteristic bands can also be found on NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 spectrum. It can be attributed that ZIF-8 was formed on NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 surface. In addition, the band at 1633 cm−1 in NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 was disappeared in NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 due to the coordination of amine group of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 nanotube with Zn2+ in ZIF-8 [51,56,57].\nFig. 5 presents the XRD of the adsorbents. The peak in 2θ=26° for CNT is due to the graphite hexagonal crystal plate [54]. Also, the crystal structure of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 composites is studied by XRD. The broad diffraction peaks show the particles with low crystallinity [50]. The peaks of CNT in the 2θ range at 26° and 43° are attributed to the (002) and (100) reflection planes, respectively [58,59]. In addition, XRD was used to investigate the crystalline structure of the bare CNT on functionalized Fe2O3. Fig. 5 indicates that the pristine CNT and CNT/Fe2O3 show two peaks at 26.14° (002 plane) and 44.22° (100 plane). The functionalization of the CNT with Fe2O3 did not change the CNT crystalline structure with two prominent peaks. The CNT/Fe2O3 has a slightly different pattern because of the high degree of Fe2O3functionalization compared with Fe2O3 on CNT surface [60]. The XRD pattern of CNT/Fe2O3 showed that the CNT/Fe2O3 was a mixture of two phases (Fe2O3 and CNT). The peaks at 2θ= 26.2° and 44.2° were due to (002) and (101) plane of CNT, respectively. These two peaks corresponding to CNT structure also exist in CNT/Fe2O3 pattern. The results indicated the suitable crystallinity of Fe2O3 with no impurities. Thus, it might be deduced that CNT/Fe2O3 hetero-structures were formed using the Fenton’s regent method [2,54]. In the case of NH2CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8, the XRD only presented the MOF peaks, while the main diffraction peak of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 is very weak. The results presented that MOF particles in situ grown on the NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 maintained a suitable crystal structure and its surface was covered by MOF.\nFig. 6 indicated that the zeta potential values of the synthesized materials were different. The significantly negative charged NH2-CNT/ Fe2O3 at pH=7 strongly adsorbs the positively charged ions. In\naddition, the amine group of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 has the similar role as a linker to produce MOF structures through coordination interactions. Thus, the NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 reacts with the metal ions via the electrostatic/coordination interaction to form a stable linkage, and the metal ions connected on the NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 acted as Zn2+ nucleation nodes for further growing MOF. After adding the linker solution into the zinc nitrate/CNT suspension, the linker rapidly reacted with the metal nudes on CNT and the metal ions in the suspension, resulting in the produced MOF growing on CNT to produce the NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 structure [52,61,62].\nFig. 7 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of ZIF-8, CNT, CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 and NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 at different conditions. For all the samples, NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 has the highest surface area (1659 m2/g). The results showed that the surface area of CNT, ZIF-8, and CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 are 79, 1485, and 1515m2/g, respectively. The previously published paper reported lower surface area of\nZIF-8/CNT (1169m2/g) [52]. Fig. 8 presents the magnetic property of the synthesized nanomaterials. The saturation magnetization for Fe2O3, NH2-CNT/Fe2O3, and NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 were studied. The value of magnetization of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3 was lower than that of Fe2O3 because of the presence of CNT and amine functionalization. After encapsulation via MOF, the value of magnetization diminished. The NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 still shows magnetization, indicating its capability for separation. Herein, the synthesized materials were separated by magnet after the dye removal due to their magnetic properties."

In these plots,\nas the one pair of factors is representing, the other parameters are kept constant.\nFigs. 9a and 10 a express that the removal efficiency of two cationic dyes was increased by passing the time and also increase the amount of adsorbent dosage. By increasing the amount of adsorbent dosage, the number of active surface sites increased. So, increasing in the sportive specific surface area leads to more availability of large number of active spots for dye molecules to be adsorbed. The effect of contact time is also investigated in this study. The enhancing in mixing time between adsorbent and adsorbate (dye), let higher opportunity to dye molecules for adsorbing on the adsorbent surface. This impact, of course, has limited and after 180min the active surface sites of adsorbent were\nalmost occupied and no more available, so the adsorption reach to equilibrium point of it.\nBased on the fact that dye concentration is one of driving force in adsorption process, the rate of active sites saturation speeded up by increasing in some dye molecules collision on adsorbent surface. As for being seen from Figs. 9d and 10 d, improvement in removal percentage was occurred by concentrating the dye solution. The dye concentration\nby playing an important role in mass transfer of adsorbates from bulk of solution to the surface of adsorbent, leave an important effect on adsorption process. Due to the effective adsorption of hydroxyl (OH−) and hydronium (H3O+) ions on the adsorbent surface, pH has become important factor [65]. Actually, the solution pH by controlling the surface charge density of adsorbent particles made a rule as another driving force of adsorption process. The existence of this high negative charge is\ndue to the functional group of the NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 surface. Increasing the amount of dye uptake at higher pH values due to the more negative surface charge of adsorbent, made progress in dye removal (Figs. 9b, c, 10 b, and c)."

The correlation coefficient (R2) values for pollutant adsorption by ZIF-8 and NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 indicated that isotherm data followed the Freundlich model, demonstrating the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface. The values of n for the Freundlich isotherm for ZIF-8 and NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 indicated the favorable nature of adsorption. Also, the D–R isotherm data presented the physical nature of dye removal (E < 8 kJ/mol)."

The kinetic models were plotted (Fig. S3 for MG and Fig. S4 for\nRhB: Supplementary file). The kinetic constants were measured and presented in Table S11. The data followed the pseudo-second order model. The comparison of rate constants showed that the MOF removed dyes swifter than that of NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8."

In each cycle, the dye concentration was 25mg/ L, and 0.004 g of the nanocomposite was added and stirred for 145min. After each cycle, the separated materials were washed using ethanol. At last, the recovered adsorbents were washed and dried for 12 h at 60 °C then applied for another adsorption cycle. Fig. 19 indicates removal percentage of the MOF and nanocomposite. The nanocomposite exhibited stable and high reusability almost 91% efficiency over five cycles."

The nanomaterials including ZIF-8, Fe2O3, CNT/Fe2O3, NH2-CNT/Fe2O3, CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8, NCFZ-5, NCFZ-10, and NCFZ-15 were characterized. They were used for selective removing MG and RhB from binary systems. Data are analyzed by several methods such as SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) [67], Student t-test [68], etc. Herein, RSM and ANN were used for optimizing dye removal. The BET data showed that the surface area increased in nanocomposite (NH2-CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8: 1659m2/g) than that of pure (ZIF-8: 1485m2/g). Contaminant removal obeyed the\nFreundlich isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetic models. The selected optimum amount of MG and RhB removal percentage in a binary mixture at an initial pollutant concentration of 25mg/L, pH of 6, NH2CNT/Fe2O3/ZIF-8 and mixing time of 0.004 g at 145min were 90.93 and 19.38%, respectively. The RSM presented optimum conditions experimentally were checked by running off 10 proposed runs and the same results achieved by < 2% errors. The outputs of ANN model overlapped with the experimental data. The binary system dye removal data indicated the synthesized nanocomposite with recycling and regeneration ability could be used for treating wastewater."
