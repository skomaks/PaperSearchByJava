      "text" : "Air pollution seriously deteriorates the environment which mankind relies on and can simultaneously endanger human health. Especially, with the giant development of science and technology, the emission of gas pollutant has increased greatly, and air quality is facing the probability of aggravation. People may have to suffer from the harm done by toxic gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [1–6] in their daily life, so it is very crucial to detect and discriminate them and finally control their release processes. Xylene, as a representative VOC, is widely used in coatings, resins, dyes, inks and other industry processes. However, xylene is classified as A4 by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). It has irritating effects on the eyes and upper respiratory tract [7]. Especially, at high concentration, it can bring about a paralytic effect on person’s central nervous system, and its long-term exposure may bring risks of neurasthenia syndrome. Therefore, an effective method for its highly sensitive detection and real-time monitoring is urgently needed.\nGas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors [8–10] have been extensively studied because of its low cost, controllable production, fast response et al. [11,12]. ZnO [13,14], WO3 [15,16], Fe2O3 [17], MoO3 [18], SnO2 [19–21] and In2O3 [22,23] are typical semiconductor\nsensing materials. Many of them are explored to detect xylene. For example, Li et al. prepared Cr-doped WO3 nanofibers and increased the response of xylene from 7.44 to 35.04 by Cr doping [24]; the Ni-doped branched ZnO nanowire network prepared by Woo et al. had high selectivity of 42.44 to p-xylene [25]; Xu et al. also used novel flower-like Co3O4 structures to greatly enhance the sensing properties of xylene [26]. MoO3 is a typical N-type wide bandgap (Eg= 3.2 eV) semiconductor material and also can be used as xylene sensing material. MoO3 nanosheets array was prepared by Qin et al. to selective detect xylene [27]; Au-loaded MoO3 hollow spheres prepared by Sui et al. increased the response of xylene by 3.9 times [28]; Y-doped MoO3 nanoarrays fabricated by Qin et al. showed not only good response of 28.3, but also good selectivity to xylene [29]. These results exhibit the promising prospect of MoO3 as a gas-sensitive material.\nTo realize the practical application of semiconductor oxide sensing material, various ways are taken to improve their sensing properties. One of them is to construct microstructures beneficial to the chemical reaction on the surface of sensing material. Presently, various MoO3 microstructures such as nanorods [30], nanosheets [31], nanobelts [32], nanoflowers [33] et al. have been explored. Thereinto, hierarchical flower-like structure and spherical structure have attracted more attention because of their large specific surface area and easy gas\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.126888 Received 9 March 2019; Received in revised form 17 June 2019; Accepted 26 July 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

The Zn-doped MoO3 nanobelts developed by Yang et al. increased the sensor response to ethanol by 15 times [34]; Gu et al. developed Ni-doped SnO2 materials with greatly improved the sensing performance of formaldehyde [35]; Shen et al. prepared a Nidoped MoO3 nanolamella with 4.1 times greater response to formaldehyde than pure MoO3 [36].\nIn view of the above survey, we aim to synthesize MoO3 with specific morphology and further explore its xylene sensing performance, by selectively doping Ni2+. Therefore, in this paper, Ni-doped MoO3 pompons were synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Among them, 5mol% Ni doped MoO3 pompon has the xylene response value of 62.6 at 250 °C, 18 times that of pure MoO3. Meanwhile, selectivity has been greatly improved compared to other VOC gases. In addition, sensor repeatability, response recovery, long-term stability, etc. have also been improved. Therefore, this study provides a novel and feasible scheme for the efficient detection of xylene."

For a complete preparation process, 0.5 g of sodium molybdate dihydrate and nickel nitrate hexahydrate in a molar ratio of Ni/Mo of 0.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0 mol% were first dissolved in a mixed solvent of 50ml deionized water and 20ml absolute ethanol. Then, 8mmol thiourea and appropriate amount of citric acid were added to the above solution. After vigorous stirring of 30min, the obtained mixed solution was placed in a stainless-steel autoclave containing a polytetrafluoroethylene liner, followed by heating at 180 °C for 22 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the turbid solution was centrifuged several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and subsequently dried in air at 60 °C for one day. Finally, the obtained powder was collected and calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 3 h. The desired products with Ni concentration of 0.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0 mol% were sequentially labeled as S-0, S-3%, S-5% and S-7%."

The ratio is defined as sensor response (S). Specially, S=Ra/Rg is for a reducing gas and S=Rg/Ra is for an oxidizing gas.

      "text" : "The phase structures of the synthesized S-0, S-3%, S-5% and S-7% were analyzed by using X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Their XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2a. For S-0, S-3% and S-5%, all diffraction peaks correspond to standard XRD pattern of orthorhombic MoO3 (JCPDS Card No. 35-609), and no phase of nickel or nickel related compounds could be detected. But for S-7%, extra two peaks with low intensity were found at 28.77° and 43.88°. They correspond to the (220) and (330) diffraction peaks of NiMoO4 (JCPDS Card No. 33-948), indicating that small amount of NiMoO4 is produced at doping concentration higher than 7mol%. To further identify the enterting of Ni2+ into the lattice, the magnified diffraction pattern between 23 and 28 degrees\n(shown in Fig. 2b) is checked carefully. As can be seen from it, when Ni doping concentration increases, the diffraction peak shifts significantly to the direction of small angle with the slightly decreased peak intensity and increased width. The shift of the diffraction peaks may be attributed to the fact that the radius of Ni2+ (0.72 Å) is larger than that of Mo6+ (0.62 Å). According to Bragg’s Law 2dsinθ=nλ, the shift of the diffraction summit to the left occurs when the larger ion is doped into the matrix. Furthermore, the average crystal sizes of S-0, S-3%, S-5% and S-7% can be estimated by Scherrer formula D=0.89λ/βcosθ, which are 27.66, 25.07, 22.91 and 21.67 nm, respectively. It may be that exotic Ni2+ inhibits the growth of MoO3 crystal.\nThe morphological characteristics of samples were observed by FESEM and TEM. The low magnification FESEM images of S-0, S-3%, S5% and S-7% are shown in Fig. 3a–d. It can be observed clearly that their morphologies change gradually with the increased doping\namount. The undoped sample S-0 consists of nanospheres with the diameter about 800 nm, which is assembled by curved nanosheets (as shown in Fig. 3a interpolation), while the S-3% and S-5% are like rougher pompons. The diameter of the pompon is about 200–300 nm, much smaller than that of S-0. Moreover, the assembling nanosheets become more dispersed with Ni doping. For S-7%, the nanosheets are so dispersed that pompons almost collapse. Ni2+ doping indeed greatly affects the micromorphology and the grain growth of MoO3.\nFig. 4a shows the TEM images of S-5%. Uniform hierarchical pompons with the size of 200–300 nm was observed, consistent with its FESEM images. Its local magnified image is shown in Fig. 4b. Twodimensional nanosheets assembling the pompons can be clearly seen. Fig. 4c-d are high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in designated region. Clear lattice fringes can be observed with lattice spacing of 0.135 nm and 0.326 nm, corresponding to (202) and (021) crystal planes of MoO3, respectively. In addition, EDS mapping analysis was performed on S-5% pompons (shown in Fig. 4e–g), demonstrating that Mo, O and Ni are uniformly distributed in the material."

      "text" : "The gas sensing properties of S-0, S-3%, S-5% and S-7% were studied and compared in detail in order to obtain the excellent gas sensor and explore the roles that Ni doping played on improved sensing performance.\nAt present, the most commonly adopted theory for the mechanism of semiconductor gas sensors is that the reaction between the chemisorbed oxygen species on the surface of gas sensing materials and the target gas molecules brings about the change of the electrical resistance of the materials [37–40]. For a metal oxide semiconductor, work temperature seriously affects its gas response, so the optimal operating temperature should be determined firstly. All the samples were measured between 175–325 °C. Their response values to 100 ppm xylene are shown in Fig. 5. It can be clearly observed that every response curve\nwith temperature can be divided into two phases: the rising and the falling phase. The maximum response value of each sample appears at 250 °C. So, all the subsequent measurements were made at 250 °C. This operating temperature is much lower than those mentioned in many published literature [41–45]. In addition, the response values of S-0, S3%, S-5% and S-7% at 250 °C are 3.48, 14.56, 62.61 and 10.23, respectively. Obviously, all sensors based on Ni-doped MoO3 have higher response than undoped MoO3 sensor. Among them, the S-5% based sensor response is 18 times higher than that of S-0 based sensor with the highest sensitivity.\nIt is essential for sensors to have excellent selectivity in practical applications. Fig. 6a shows the responses of each sample to 100 ppm different test gases (xylene, ethanol, methanol, acetone, formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene) at 250 °C. Sensors based on S-0\nexhibit lower response to these test gases, while all sensors based on Nidoped samples have improved gas response. In particular, S-5% has the greatest response to all the test gases. For the sake of clearness, the responses of S-5% and S-0 to all these gases are compared in Fig. 6b. To evaluate the selectivity of the device, the ratio (Sxylene/Sother) between the response toward xylene (Sxylene) and that of one particular gas (Sother) is adopted. Large ratio means good selectivity. The ratios of S5% and S-0 for all the test gases are shown in Fig. 6c. For S-0, all the ratios are less than 2 and selective detection is impossible. On the contrary, these values for S-5% are between 5 and 13, making a sharp contrast and showing excellent selectivity.\nResponse time and recovery time are defined as the time consumed to achieve 90% resistance change, which are also important parameters to evaluate the performance of sensors. Fig. 7a shows the individual response and recovery curves of S-0 and S-5%. The resistance of S-5%\nsensor in air is much larger than that of S-0. As evidenced by XRD results, the grain size of MoO3 decreases with Ni2+ doping. The consequent more Schottky contact between grains results in increased resistance. In addition, possible decreased carrier concentration caused by Ni2+ doping also contributes to the large resistance of S-5%. With the injection of xylene, the resistances of the sensor drop rapidly to a stable low resistance state, and the S-5% resistance drops even more. When the sensors return to the air environment, the resistances restore to the initial stable value. For S-5%, the response and recovery time are 1 and 50 s, respectively and the corresponding values for S-0 are 9 and 40 s. It is clear that the response speed of the S-5% sensor is greatly improved. This may be due to the increase of active sites and more active surface caused by Ni doping, both of which can accelerate the reaction between reactive oxygen species and gas molecules. Transient resistance of S-5% sensor to 100 ppm xylene was measured repeatedly at 250 °C. As depicted in Fig. 7b, S-5% sensors exhibited fast response and good short-term repeatability.\nThe dynamic response curves of S-0 and S-5% to 1–100 ppm xylene\nat 250 °C are shown in Fig. 8a–b. Obviously, the gas responses based on these two sensing materials increased with the xylene gas concentration. It is clearly observed that the response of S-5% sensor increases approximately linearly with xylene concentration in the whole measurement range. While for S-0, only in the concentration of lower than 50 ppm, there exists an approximate linearity. Above 50 ppm, the response value increases slowly, indicating that the sensor gradually became saturated. For the sake of clarity, the relations between response value and xylene concentration are further depicted in Fig. 8c. They further verify that Ni doping can promote more gas molecules to react with absorbed surface oxygen and greatly improve the sensing performance of MoO3 to xylene. In addition, the response and recovery times of S-5% sensor at different xylene concentrations are quantified in detail (Fig. 8d). The response time decreases significantly with the increase of xylene concentration, while the recovery time increases. It can be understood that high concentration of xylene will accelerate the diffusion kinetics of gas molecules in sensing materials and hinder the desorption of most gas molecules [46].\nConsidering the practical application of gas sensors, the long-term stability and the influence of humidity on the sensor must be examined. Fig. 9a shows the responses of these four sensors to 100 ppm xylene in 30 consecutive days. All the devices exhibit good stability. Particularly, the response value of the sensor based on S-5% fluctuates around 60 with variation range less than 4%, indicating that it has good long-term stability. The responses of S-5% sensor under different humidity conditions are shown in Fig. 9b. With the increase of humidity, the response value decreases slightly, and there remains 40.5 response at 90% RH. Therefore, the S-5% sensor has good stability in a humid environment. Based on the above results, it is strongly proved that the 5mol% Ni doping greatly improves the sensing performance of MoO3\ntowards xylene. Many metal oxide semiconductor gas-sensing materials have been studied to detect xylene. Their xylene sensing properties are compared in Table 1. Among these devices, Ni-doped MoO3 sensor displays higher response, faster response speed and lower working temperature. On the whole, MoO3 exhibits excellent sensing performance toward xylene by Ni doping."

      "text" : "At present, the theoretical basis for explaining the principle of semiconductor gas sensors is the oxidation-reduction reaction between oxygen on the surface of gas-sensing materials and gas molecules, which results in the change of sensor resistance [37–40]. MoO3 is a Ntype semiconductor. When the sensor is exposed to air, oxygen molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the MoO3 pompons and trap conduction band electrons. Thus, a depletion layer on the surface of the material is formed and resistance of sensing material increases. In this situation, active negative oxygen ions such as −O2 , −O and −O2 relying on the working temperature are produced. The above physical and chemical reaction processes are simply expressed in Eqs. (1)–(4).\n→gas adsO ( ) O ( )2 2 (1)\n+ → < − − ∘ads e adsO ( ) O ( ) (T 100 C)2 2 (2)\n+ → < < − − − ∘ ∘ads e adsO ( ) 2O ( ) (100 C T 300 C)2 (3)\n+ → > − − − ∘ads e adsO ( ) O ( ) (T 300 C)2 (4)\nWhen the sensor is transferred to the xylene atmosphere at 250 °C, the xylene gas molecules can react easily with the reactive oxygen species adsorbed on the surface of the MoO3 pompons producing CO2 and H2O. In the meantime, the free electrons captured by oxygen species can be returned to the conduction band resulting in narrowed depletion layer and reduced resistance. These procedures can be expressed by Eqs. (5) and (6).\n→gas adsC H ( ) C H ( )8 10 8 10 (5)\n+ → + + − −ads eC H ( ) 21O 8CO 5H O 218 10 2 2 (6)\nThe procedures of the chemiresistant gas sensing mainly involve gas\ndiffusion, physical and chemical gas absorption, surface chemical reaction, transfer majority carriers et al. Every step in these procedures may have an effect on the sensing performance of a gas sensor. In order to investigate the factors for the enhancement of Ni-doped MoO3 pompons-based sensor, several measurement methods characterizing the surface-related properties were adopted. XPS was performed to analyze the element chemical states on the surface of sensing materials. The Mo 3d and Ni 2p high-resolution spectra of S-5% are shown in Fig. 10a–b. The spectrum of Mo 3d splits into two characteristic peaks of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 at 234.45 eV and 231.25 eV, indicating the oxidation state of Mo6+ [48]. The peak splitting of Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/ 2 is attributed to the coupling of spin and orbital angular momentums of Ni2+ 2p electrons, verifying the existence of Ni2+ in S-5% [49]. The O\n1s spectra of all the four samples are displayed in Fig. 10c–f. They all can be decomposed into three fitting peaks (OL, OV, OC), showing three different oxygen states. The OL component (530.15 ± 0.20 eV) is related to lattice oxygen species, the OV component (531.25 ± 0.20 eV) shows the ionization characteristics of oxygen in oxygen defect region of MoO3 matrix, while the OC component (532.40 ± 0.20 eV) is attributed to chemisorbed oxygen of gas-sensitive materials [50]. The proportions of OC and OV increases with the increase of Ni doping, shown in Table 2. Especially, the content of OC increases from 6.22% for S-0 to 29.21% for S-5%, but decreases to 14.64% for S-7%. Many studies have shown that oxygen vacancies and chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of gas-sensing materials seriously affect the sensing properties of materials [51,52]. The increase of OC and OV components\nmeans that more chemisorbed oxygen at the surface of the material can participate in the surface reaction, which makes the conductance of the material change greatly. Therefore, the change of oxygen components caused by Ni doping can largely promote the sensing properties of the material to xylene.\nThe pore size and specific surface area of samples were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. The results (Fig. 11) show that the specific surface area of Ni-doped samples S-3%, S-5% and S-7% are 38.05, 49.60 and 23.00m2 g−1, respectively, which are larger than that of S-0 (11.18 m2 g−1). Among them, S-5% with largest response to xylene has the largest specific surface area. The above result is consistent with the morphology evolution of the samples. As analyzed from the SEM results, with the Ni doping, the nanosheets constructing the pompon get loose. Their loose microstructure can effectively avoid their agglomeration and increase their specific surface area. The large specific area helps more gas molecules contact with the sensing material and obtain a high response. In accompany with these morphology change, pore size and pore volume of these sensing materials are also changing. S-5% has the largest values among these samples, which is conducive to the diffusion of gas molecules into the whole sensitive layer. In addition, according to the XRD analysis results, the average crystal sizes of S-0 and S-5% are 27.66 and 22.91 nm, respectively. Previous studies [38] show that the smaller the crystallites, the more favorable it is to get a high response.\nThe excellent selectivity of the S-5% sensor can be explained as follows. Selecting Ni2+ is used to improve the selectivity of xylene. Studies have shown that p-type oxide semiconductors have high catalytic activity for VOC oxidation, mainly due to their abundant oxygen adsorption and multivalent properties [25,26,53,54]. Ni2+ doping also plays the same role as its corresponding oxide [55,56]. Many studies have found that the introduction of Ni2+ promotes the complete oxidation of methyl groups [25,53,55–57], and subsequent dehydrogenation process of xylene can occur due to the oxidation of methyl groups. Therefore, the selectivity of xylene increases significantly by Ni doping."

The sensing results show that the 5mol% Ni-doped MoO3 sample has the best xylene response of 62.6, 18 times larger than that of pristine MoO3. Besides, the excellent selectivity caused by the Ni doping, good short-term repeatability and long-term stability are achieved. Ni induced changes in oxygen composition, specific surface area and crystal size could be responsible for the improvement in sensing performance. Its excellent xylene sensing performance makes Ni-doped MoO3 pompon be a potential candidate for xylene sensors."

The phase structure, micro-structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) etc., respectively. The morphology can be changed by adjusting the doping concentration of Ni. Among them, the 5mol% Ni-doped MoO3 sample with a pompon-like morphology improved gas accessibility significantly. Prominently, the response of the sensors on xylene was increased 18 times from 3.48 to 62.6, the response time was about 1 s and the best selectivity was obtained at the optimum temperature of 250 °C. These breakthroughs are attributed to the increase of surface-active sites and the improvement of micro-morphology caused by Ni doping.",
