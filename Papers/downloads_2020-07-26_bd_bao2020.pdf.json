      "text" : "Thermoelectric (TE) technology has been considered as an ecofriendly solution for tackling the global energy crisis through solid-state conversion between heat and electricity [1,2]. Extensive TE materials, such as silicides [3], PbTe [4–6], half-Heusler [7] and superionic materials [8], are being explored for power generation applications. The\nconversion efficiency of TE materials is dominated by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, T and S2σ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature, and power factor (PF), respectively, and κ is the total thermal conductivity contributed by charge carriers κe and lattice vibration κl [9]. The improvement of ZT value depends on the optimization of these parameters because they are strongly correlated [10–13]. In recent years, several\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.124295 Received 15 December 2019; Received in revised form 24 January 2020; Accepted 30 January 2020\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Bi2Te3-based materials have layered structures and show remarkable anisotropic TE properties along and cross the layers owing to the weak van der Waals bonding between Te–Te layers in the crystal structure [29]. It has been reported that σ and κ of Bi2Te3 along the layer are 3–7 times and 2–2.5 times, respectively, larger than σ and κ cross the layer [35,36]. Such characteristics inspire the exploration of texture engineering as an effective strategy for developing high-performance Bi2Te3-based TE materials. Currently, hot deformation is the most common approach to enhance the texture of Bi2Te3-based TE materials [36–40], which facilitates the carrier transports and reduces κl, leading to an enhanced ZT. However, the complicated hot deformation procedures are energy-inefficient, and their results suffer from poor repeatability caused by the modified chemical compositions during the multiple high-temperature processing as well as the increased n during the ingot pulverization due to the donor-like effects [41]. To solve this issue, Wu et al. [42] developed a liquid-phase hot deformation method, which introduced Te-rich eutectic phase into the Bi2(Te,Se)3-melted ingot, and hot-deformed the ingot at the temperature of above the eutectic point to allow the liquid to be extruded. This method synergistically enhances the carrier mobility (µH) and reduces κl by weakening the interfacial electron scattering, texturing and creating dense dislocations and lattice distortions. However, it is hard to control the texture degree of Bi2Te3-based materials by these hot-deformationbased methods.\nHerein, we report a facile texturing method for Bi2Te3 via nanostructure engineering. We synthesize Bi2Te3 nanostructures with controlled morphologies (nanoparticles, step-like nanoplates and ultrathin nanosheets, respectively) by using a solvothermal method and sinter them by using a fast spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. The different morphologies lead to different stacking of nanostructures, therefore, different texture degrees after sintering. Our study suggests that the key of texture engineering is to balance the good electrical transport properties and low κ: only the sample with proper texture exhibits high S2σ and low κ, resulting in a remarkably enhanced peak ZT of ~0.69 at 333 K. Moreover, we find that too strong texture can reduce the compressive strengths (perpendicular to the press direction) of Bi2Te3 due to lack of the impediment of crack propagation. This study provides a guideline for the future development of high-performance TE materials with layered structures via texture engineering."

The densities (ρ) of the pellets were measured using the Archimedes method, which suggests that all our samples have relative densities greater than 95%. Thermal conductivity was calculated by κ = D× Cp × ρ, where Cp and D are the specific heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity, respectively. Cp is obtained from the empirical formulas (Cp = 108.06 + 5.53 × 10−2 TJK−1 mol−1) [23]. D values was measured by the Laser Flash Diffusivity method (LFA 457, NETZSCH). S and σ were measured by a Seebeck coefficient/electrical resistance measuring system (Cryoall, CTA-3). A homemade Hall system was used to confirm the charge carrier concentrations (n) under a reversible magnetic field of 1.5 T. The uncertainties of all measurements were taken as ~5%, and uncertainties of S2σ, κ and ZT were estimated to be about 20%. TE properties test of all the pellet samples were measured perpendicular to the press direction."

      "text" : "Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized samples, in which all the patterns can be well-indexed as Bi2Te3 (PDF# 15-0863) without any impurities or secondary phases, suggesting that pure Bi2Te3 have been synthesized. Notably, the peaks belong to {00l} planes of BT-3 (the ab plane illustrated in Fig. 1b) show obviously different ratios compared with the peaks of BT-1 and BT-2, indicating that BT-3 has significantly different growth orientation with other two samples. Moreover, all these three samples have identical crystal parameters because all the XRD peaks do not show any obvious peak shift.\nFig. 2 shows the morphologies of the as-synthesized samples characterized by SEM and AFM. Fig. 2a is a typical SEM image, which shows that the main shape of BT-1 is particle or thick plate with smooth and clear surfaces, having varied sizes from ~100 to 400 nm. The AFM\nresult of Fig. 2b confirms the particle-like shape of BT-1, which has a lateral size of ~298 nm and a thickness of ~143 nm. The morphology of BT-2 is hexagonal and step-like nanoplates with size distribution from 200 to 500 nm, as shown in Fig. 2c. The step-like feature can be further confirmed by AFM, as shown in Fig. 2d, in which each step has a thickness around 11 nm. Such a morphological difference indicates that BT-2 has different growth mechanism with BT-1 sample due to the different NaOH concentration. Our experiment results show that high NaOH concentration can accelerate the chemical reaction, where 12 h is used for BT-1 to complete the reaction to obtain pure Bi2Te3 while only 4 h is needed for BT-2 pure phase (Fig. S1). The slow growth rate enables BT-1 to form well-developed particles or thick-plates, while the step-like morphology suggests the crystal growth of BT-2 may be dominated by the development of screw dislocations during its growth due to the higher growth rate [44,45]. It is very hard to characterize the morphology of BT-3 using SEM. As shown in Fig. 2e, only highly aggregated sheet-like structure can be observed in BT-3. The AFM results (Fig. 2f) reveal that BT-3 has the morphology of ultra-thin nanosheet with a thickness of only 4 nm and lateral sizes of several micrometres. Such in-plane preferential growth is mainly due to the layered structure of Bi2Te3.\nThe as-synthesized powders were sintered into pellets by SPS for TE property measurement. Fig. 3a shows a typical optical image of the assintered cylinder-shaped pellet with 12 mm in height and 12.5 mm in diameter. Here, we only focus on the TE properties along the direction perpendicular to the SPS pressure. The as-sintered cylinders are cut into cuboids (inset of Fig. 3a) for performance measurement. Fig. 3b shows the XRD patterns of the sintered pellets parallel to the press direction.\nThe peak intensities of (0 0 6) and (0,0,15) of BT-3 are considerably stronger than that of BT-1 and BT-2, suggesting that BT-3 has a preferential orientation of (00l) plane [46]. The orientation degree of ab plane orientation is revealed by the ratios of the integrated intensity of (0 0 6) and (0,0,15) planes to that of the strongest (0 1 5) peak [39], respectively, as shown in Fig. 3b. In general, larger ratio means higher orientation degree in (00l) plane. It’s evident that as-sintered BT-3 has the highest ratios of 84% and 139%, corresponding to the highest orientation degrees among all the three pellets, while BT-2 has relatively higher ratios (53%, 33%) compared to BT-1 (14%, 19%). The texture fraction of (00l) plane was calculated by using Lotgering method [47]: F = (P − P0)/(1 − P0), with P0 = I0(00 l)/∑I0(hkl) and P = I(00 l)/∑I (hkl), where I and I0 are the peak intensities of the measured and randomly oriented samples, respectively. The F values for BT-1, BT-2 and BT-3 are 0.07, 0.20 and 0.50, respectively, confirming a significant change in texture degree of these samples. The obvious intensity difference of XRD peak indicates that the pellets should have different textures, which were further confirmed by cross-sectional SEM observations, as shown in Fig. 3c–e. As can be seen, the as-sintered BT-1 has randomly stacked grains, while the sintered BT-2 shows textures perpendicular to the press direction, and the sintered BT-3 shows very strongly orientated textures perpendicular to the press direction. Benefited from the fast SPS process, the crystal grains of BT-1 and BT-2 have not shown significant growth (Fig. 3c and d) with similar averaged grain size of ~500 nm, while the as-synthesized ultrathin nanosheets of BT-3 grow into thicker sheets with thickness of tens of nanometres (Fig. 3e). Such a crystal growth could be attributed to that ultrathin nanosheets (~4 nm) have significantly high surface energy, therefore,\nvery high activity for crystal growth. Fig. 4 plots the temperature-dependent TE properties of the sintered samples. Fig. 4a shows the temperature-dependent σ, in which the sintered BT-2 and BT-3 have comparable σ, which exhibits a typical semiconductor behavior. The value of σ drops down by about 20% with increasing the temperature from 300 to 420 K. The sintered BT-1 has significantly lower σ than other two samples without obvious\ntemperature dependence, which could be attributed to the enhanced carrier scattering and reduce μH due to a high density of grain boundaries and weaker texture in the sintered BT-1 [42]. According to our Hall measurement (Table 1), such differences in σ are mainly attributed to the distinct nH and μH. As can be seen, the nH values of the sintered BT-1, BT-2 and BT-3 are 3.3 × 1019, 4.3 × 1019 and 4.0 × 1019 cm−3, respectively. Previous studies [48,49] suggest that such stepped\nnanoplates have higher conductance than the smooth nanoplates, due to the increased nH resulting from the presence of dangling bond at the step-edges, which can be applicable in our observed results. Moreover, the stronger texturing of the samples leads to larger μH, which is consistent with other studies [36–41,50,51]. μH of our samples with variable texture degree exhibits obvious difference as summarized in Table 1, which demonstrates that both the maximum μH of the sintered BT-3 (126.18 m2 V−1 s−1) and BT-2 (115.22 cm2 V−1 s−1) are higher than that of BT-1 (71.27 m2 V−1 s−1).\nFig. 4b presents negative S of all three samples, indicating that the major charge carriers are electrons. As shown in Fig. 4b, S of the sintered Bi2Te3 is not sensitive to the modified texture, while S of the sintered BT-2 is slightly higher than that of other two samples. The calculated effective mass (ms*) derived from Seebeck and Hall measurements based on the single parabolic band (SPB) model suggests that\nthe sintered BT-2 has a larger ms*, which may be attributed to the defects such as screw dislocations that might induce the change of band structures [37,48]. Fig. 4c plots the calculated S2σ, in which the sintered BT-2 has a maximum S2σ of 25.0 μW cm−1 K−2 at 314 K due to the optimized σ and S. Fig. 4d shows that the sintered BT-1 has the lowest κ of 1.11 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and the sintered BT-3 has the highest κ of 1.89 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K. Interestingly, the κ values of all three samples do not show very strong temperature dependence from 300 to 420 K. To determine the contributions of κe and κl to κtot, we calculated κe (Fig. 4e) according to the Wiedemann-Franz law [23]: κe = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number. Here, L is calculated from the measured S (the detailed calculations are discussed in the Supplementary information). Due to the higher σ, the sintered BT-2 and BT-3 have much higher κe values than the sintered BT-1. The κl values are calculated by κl = κ − κe and plotted in Fig. 4f. The sintered BT-1 and BT-2 have similarly low κl due to the strong phonon scattering by the high-density grain boundaries, the slightly lower κl of the sintered BT-2 at room temperature may be attributed to the higher density of interfaces and dislocations due to its step-like shape [52]. Surprisingly, the strong texture of the sintered BT-3 leads to high κl values of ~1.5 W m−1 K−1 across the whole measuring temperature range, which is the major contribution to the high κ of the sintered BT-3 (> 1.81 W m−1 K−1) between 300 and 420 K.\nThe temperature-dependent ZT of all three samples is plotted in Fig. 5a. The sintered BT-2 has the highest peak ZT of 0.69 at 333 K benefitting from the synergistically optimized electrical transport\nproperties and thermal transport property, which is much higher than the ZT values of sintered BT-1 and BT-3. It’s worthy to mention that the peak ZT values of our samples are obtained at nearly room temperature, suggesting that our products have the great potential in room-temperature TE applications. The results above further indicate that the texture of Bi2Te3 can be controlled by tuning the morphology of the powder products, and consequently to affect the TE properties. After the rapid SPS sintering, BT-2 has the highest ZT among these three samples, which is benefited from the improved µH via texturing by textures and reduced κ via increased phonon scattering by nanostructures and interfaces. Randomly stacked Bi2Te3 particles lead to the lowest texture degree, which can strongly scatter the electrons and phonons, resulting in low electrical transport properties and low κ, as well as low ZT values. The ultrathin nanosheets lead to the highest texture degree. Its electrical transport properties are comparable to that of BT-2, but its κl is significantly increased due to the strong texturing [53], resulting in low ZT. Such texture-dependent TE properties are schematically demonstrated in Fig. 5b.\nIt is well-known that layer-structured bulks with high orientation degree are easy to suffer layered failure, which largely reduces the reliability and life time of devices [38,54]. We further examined the mechanical properties (compressive strength, in this case) of the sintered samples by using a universal material test machine. Fig. 5c shows a photograph of the cuboids during test. The compressive direction and TE measurement direction are consistent, and the compressive strengths of the sintered BT-1, BT-2 and BT-3 are exhibited in Fig. 5d. All three samples are subjected to slight crack before completely broken, and the compressive strengths of the sintered BT-1 and BT-2 are 37.0 and 33.4 MPa, respectively, which are significantly larger than that of sintered BT-3 (21.0 MPa). The extensions of the sintered BT-1 and BT-2 are 0.098 and 0.096 mm, respectively, which are also larger than that of the sintered BT-3 (0.061 mm). These results suggest that the mechanical properties of the sintered BT-1 and BT-2 are superior to the sintered BT-3 at the direction perpendicular to the press. The SEM images of the compressed BT-1, BT-2 and BT-3 (Fig. S3) show that the randomly orientated grains in the sintered BT-1 and BT-2 can block the propagation of cracks, while the sintered BT-3 with high orientation degree is easily to be deformed."

      "text" : "In summary, we fabricated Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric (TE) materials by facile solvothermal methods combined with spark plasma sintering process. We successfully tuned the texture degree of sintered Bi2Te3 by controlling the morphologies of the powder products. Our results indicate that texture can significantly affect the TE properties of Bi2Te3 by influencing the carrier and phonon transport. Neither too high nor too low degree of textures is beneficial to the TE properties in layer-structured Bi2Te3. Stronger texture degree facilitates to obtain a higher μH but also give rise to a larger κl, as well as a lower compressive strength. On the other hand, very low texture degree causes large electrical resistivity. By applying such texture engineering to realize an optimized combination of electrical and thermal transport properties with a rational degree of textures, our sintered step-like Bi2Te3 nanoplates achieve a peak ZT of 0.69 at 333 K with good mechanical properties.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
