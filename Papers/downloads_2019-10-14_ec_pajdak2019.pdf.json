The authors tested synthetic materials such as multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as well as natural materials such as coals of various ranks. The value of the surface area of Langmuir and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller, in MWCNTs and rGO was much higher than in the coal. The course of CH4 and CO2 sorption of the materials was investigated and the parameters of sorption isotherms in the pressure of 0–2.0 MPa were determined. The nanomaterials reached the sorption equilibria much faster than the coal. The highest total CH4 sorption capacity was found in low-rank coal. The highest CO2 total sorption capacity was found in MWCNTs and low-rank coal. The highest relative mean drop in CH4 and CO2 sorption capacity resulting from the increasing measurement temperature was found in the MWCNTs and the low-rank coal. The authors analysed the courses of CH4 and CO2 sorption kinetics in the materials of highly different structures. The kinetics of CH4 and CO2 accumulation in MWCNT and rGO nanomaterials progressed almost instantaneously, and their rate was many times higher than in the case of kinetics on hard coals."

      "text" : "The need to curb emissions of greenhouse gases necessitates constant improvement of the technology of CO2 and CH4 capture (Li et al., 2016; Cong et al., 2015; Gawor and Skoczylas, 2014; Marco-Lozar et al., 2014; Dutka et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2013; Chu and Majumdar, 2012; Samanta et al., 2012; Lackner et al., 2012; D’Alessandro et al., 2010). Among many available methods, binding gas through adsorption in porous media seems a promising solution. The ability of a sorbent to adsorb and store gas depends, to a large extent, on the degree of development of its surface area as well as on the amount and distribution of its pores. Laboratory analyses of the synthesis and industrial implementation of many porous materials such as carbon-based materials, polymers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and zeolites as adsorbents for CO2 and CH4 capture have been carried out for years (Sumida et al., 2012; Dawson et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2012; Holst et al., 2010). Since carbon materials give promising results in this respect, there is great interest in their application in adsorption, storage\nand separation of gas. It applies both to synthetic materials such as reduced graphene oxide or carbon nanotubes as well as natural materials such as coal (Pajdak and Skoczylas, 2018; Skoczylas et al., 2015; Georgakilas et al., 2012; Baran et al., 2015; Al-Yaseri et al., 2017; Mastalerz et al., 2012; Pone et al., 2009; Alexeev et al., 2010).\nCarbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe. Such a numerous representation of this element is accompanied by a huge number of structures in which it occurs. Graphene is a two-dimensional, bonded carbon sheet, arranged in a form of a hexagonal honeycomb mesh (Novoselov et al., 2012; Pierson 1993). It is created by a single layer of graphite, which is almost totally transparent, over a hundred times as strong as steel and very flexible. At the same time, it exhibits excellent thermal and electrical conductivity (Abergel et al., 2010). It is due to those properties that graphene is intensively tested in supercapacitors, fuel cells, batteries as well as in areas such as nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, sorption, detection, separation and storage of gas (Gadipelli and Guo, 2015). Moreover, one-layer graphene is a material of a large, theoretical surface area, amounting up to 2600 m2/g (Stoller et al., 2008), which makes it very prospective from a\n* Corresponding author.

The size of its surface area depends, among other things, on the method by which it is produced. The production method strongly impacts not only the structural properties of graphene but also electrical, physical and chemical ones. Lattice imperfections often appear during growth or processing of graphene, which for most technological applications can be problematic. However, in gas adsorption those defects can be very useful. The membranes based on graphene exhibit very good permeation properties and enable fast and selective transport of water, gases (Ali et al., 2019; Shayeganfar and Neek-Amal 2012) and some specific, small particles (Liu et al., 2015). Graphene compounds are activated in order to improve their adsorption properties. Table 1 presents selected findings of literature review concerning structural parameters of graphene and reduced graphene oxide.\nIn (Dolbin et al., 2016) graphene oxide was produced by a modified Hummer method and then it went a thermal reduction to facilitate adsorption to He, H2, Ne, N2, Kr. Unmodified graphene oxide exhibited very low sorption capacity. Thermal activation improved its sorption properties. The best results were obtained after processing the material at 900 �C. Apart from thermal activation, chemical activation is also applied with NaOH, KOH, H3PO4 and ZnCl2 as activating agents or a mixed, physiochemical activation (Liu et al., 2014). Table 2 presents selected findings of literature review concerning sorption parameters of graphene and reduced graphene oxide.\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the forms in which carbon occurs and since their discovery twenty years ago (Iijima 1991), they have found more and more applications in various fields of science and technology. Along with graphite and fullerenes they are carbon allotropes (Tanaka et al., 1999). They have diameters of several nanometres\nand the length of almost 1000 times that size – in the order of micrometres. The atoms of CNTs are arranged in hexagons and their structure is formed from a graphite-graphene sheet. Graphene in CNTs is rolled in a cylinder with a diameter of from several to several dozens of nanometres. Multiwall carbon nanotubes consist of many graphite tubes of various diameters nested within one another. The length and diameter of those structures differ considerably and determine their properties (Iijima and Ichihashi, 1993). The literature review reveals that CNTs are widely used, among others, as adsorbents of hydrogen (Pajdak and Skoczylas, 2018; Reyhani et al., 2012), heavy metals (Salam et al., 2011), organic compounds (Liu et al., 2013), and also as composite materials (Otero et al., 2012; Hermas et al., 2012) as well as anti-pollution reagents (Ren et al., 2011; Upadhyayula et al., 2009).\nMWCNTs exist as bundles of randomly entangled individual tubes. The size of the surface area varies considerably. It mainly depends on the production method, the number of tubes that form a MWCNT and the diameters of those tubes. Tables 1 and 2 presents selected findings of literature review with structural and sorption parameters of CNT. Due to the fact that the surface area of MWCNTs is smaller than the surface area of graphene, their sorption capacity is lower. However, the specific structure of CNT bundles facilitates the kinetics of sorption, which is also extremely important for sorption-based applications. From the point of view of sorption, unmodified nanotubes exhibit very low selectivity. It results from the large size of the inner diameters of CNTs – usually from 1 to 1.5 nm in SWNTs and 10 nm in MWCNTs – as compared to kinetic diameters of sorbates. A number of methods are used to improve their selectivity. Chemical modifications of nanotubes by introducing alkaline places can enhance their selectivity and ability to adsorb CO2 (Samanta et al., 2012).

Chemical modification of CNTs consisted, among others, in introducing functionalized groups at their entrances at the stage of their synthesis (Corry, 2011). Such a functionalization of SWNTs causes considerable changes in the length and morphology of CNTs.\nCoal has been used as a raw material in the conventional power generation industry for years. The urgent need to curb CO2 emissions and the growing interest in clean energy necessitate searching for alternative sources of energy, improving the fuel processing technology or using coal e.g. as a gas collecting rock (Rui et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; G�omez et al., 2019; Grabowska et al., 2018). Unlike synthetic carbon materials, coal exhibits high chemical and physical heterogeneity. It has exceptionally complex structure as well as intricate and heterogenous pore space comprising macropores (>50 nm), mesopores (2–50 nm), micropores (<2 nm) (IUPAC, 1994) and within micropores also ultra-micropores (<0.8 nm) (Sing et al., 1985). Due to the fact that over 90% of the empty space in coal falls to pores with a diameter below 1 nm, it is treated mainly as ultra-microporous material (Ettinger, 1990). Coal contains various functional groups whose presence depends on\nmany factors such as the degree of metamorphism, maceral and mineral composition, physical parametres (Skiba and Młynarczuk, 2018; Gody�n, 2016; Cai et al., 2013; Billemont et al., 2013). A specific feature of coal is the lack of direct relationship in it between the pore volume and the surface area. Consequently, in the analysis of its pore structure, it cannot be treated as a rigid porous body but rather as an ultra-microporous heterogenous copolymer (Battistutta et al., 2010; _Zyła, 2010).\nThe maceral composition, apart from the coal rank and reflexivity, has a strong impact on the surface structure of coals. Coals with high content of vitrinite (percentage share) exhibit high structural and sorption parameters. In coals with high content of internite, the values of those parameters are lower. Structural parameters determined by low pressure gas adsorption with the use of N2 are much lower than those determined with the use of CO2 (Li et al., 1999; Walker and Mahajan, 1993). Tables 1 and 2 presents selected findings of literature review with structural and sorption parameters of coal.\nThe knowledge of structural parameters of coal is crucial not only from the point of view of its exploitation, enrichment and usage in the power industry. It is also an important factor determining the efficiency and kinetics of sorption and desorption of methane (Gonet et al., 2010) as well as the sequestration of CO2 in coal seams (Zarębska and Dudzi�nska, 2008; Czerw and Ceglarska-Stefa�nska, 2008). There is a number of papers concerning gas sorption on coal. Their common topic is the analysis of the aspects connected with CH4/CO2 exchange sorption and competitive sorption. (Dutka et al., 2013; Skoczylas et al., 2015; Skoczylas and Topolnicki, 2016; Topolnicki et al., 2013; Dutka et al., 2012; Busch and Gensterblum, 2011; Clarkson and Bustin, 2000; Goodman\nA. Pajdak et al.\nJournal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering 72 (2019) 103003\net al., 2007). It was proved that CO2 sorption in coal is at least twice as high as CH4 sorption. In some documented cases, the CO2/CH4 sorption capacity ratio can amount to 10/1 (Harpalani et al., 2006; Krooss et al., 2002; Rodrigues and Lemos de Sousa, 2002). The differences in the maximum sorption efficiency of CO2 and CH4 were ascribed to various critical temperatures of those gases (Sakurovs et al., 2010).\nThe aim of this study is to comprehensively analyse the structural and sorption parameters of MWCNTs, rGO and coal of various ranks (SOB-coal, BUD-coal) and to compare their CO2 and CH4 sorption capacity. Sorption in the state of isothermal equilibrium as well as sorption kinetics were investigated. Also, the authors carried out comparative structural analysis of the surface of the materials and studied the relationship between their structural parameters and the course of sorption phenomena."

      "text" : "The microscopic observations of the carbon nanomaterials were made using a Technai G2 transmission electron microscope and a XL30 scanning electron microscope. The samples for TEM analyses were prepared by placing carbon nanotubes on a copper mesh with an amorphous carbon film. A energy dispersive spectrometer with a secondary electrons detector (SE) and a back scattered detector (BSE) was used to observe the phase changes of the topography of the sample surface. The analyses were performed in a high-pressure mode. The samples were sputtered with silver and their images were recorded at the magnification of 100x, 200x, 500x, 1000x, 2000x and 5000x, with an electron accelerating beam of 8 kV.\nThe optic microscopy images of the coals were taken using an AXIOPLAN polarising microscope with a CCD DS -Fi1 camera. Petrographic properties of the coals were determined and a quantitative point analysis was performed, including the composition of the main maceral groups. The degree of coalification of the samples was identified through the measurements of the vitrinite reflectance. The analyses were carried out according to the International Committee of Coal and Organic Petrology. The content of the maceral groups was converted into the mineral matter free state.\nThe technical analyses of the coals concerning the content of the volatile matter, ash and moisture were carried out according to PN-ISO 562:2000 and PN-ISO 1171:2002, PN-80/G-04511 norms. The skeletal density was determined using an AccuPyc II 1340 analyser by measuring the helium volume, which filled the open pores in the coal samples. The weights of the samples were specified with an analytical balance with an accuracy of 0.0001 g.\nIn order to prepare the coal for tests, the core samples were crushed and sieved with analytical sieves and next a grain fraction of 0.125–0.200 mm was selected. Using a multiple cone separation technique, 50 g samples were prepared, which were subjected to structural and sorption analyses.\nThe structural analyses of carbon materials were carried out on a ASAP 2020 analyser using the low pressure gas adsorption (LPA). The measurements were performed under isothermal conditions, in the absolute pressure range of 0–0.1 MPa CO2 was used as the adsorbate in selected temperatures: 258 K, 273 K, 288 K and 298 K. Depending on the temperature, the measurements were made in various relative pressure ranges, equal to the absolute/saturation pressure ratio of CO2 in the gas phase (p=p0). The p=p0 values for CO2 in the measurement temperatures are presented in Table 3.\nBefore the measurement with an LPA method, the samples were degassed. The nanomaterials were degassed in a vacuum of 0.4 Pa for 4 h at 378 K and then heated for 2 h at 393 K. The coal samples were degassed for 12 h at 363 K and heated for 4 h at 368 K. The measurement consisted in filling the pore volume of a sample with CO2 particles thanks to the interactions occurring on the solid/gas interface in\nunderpressure. A direct result of the analysis is the record of the gas volume accumulated in the pore space of a sample and the pressure around a sample. Knowing the volume of the sorbed gas, it was possible to specify such structural parameters as: the surface area of the monolayer and multilayer, the pore volume, average pore size and pore distribution. The space of micropores and partially of mesopores of the materials was characterized. In the calculations the authors used theoretical models of Langmuir, Henry, Brunauer-Emett-Teller (BET) (Brunauer et al., 1938), Barret-Joyer-Halenda (BJH) (Barrett et al., 1951) and Horvat-Kawazoe (HK) (Horvath and Kawazoe, 1983).\nThe analyses of CH4 and CO2 sorption on carbon materials were carried out in the pressure range from 0 to 2.0 MPa using an IGA 001 device. It is a sorption gravimetric analyser that registers weight changes of a sorbent during the process of gas sorption under isobaric and isothermal conditions. The sample weight was 100 or 500 mg. Before the measurement the samples were degassed at 355 K for 24 h in a vacuum of 10 6 Pa. A direct result of the IGA-001 analysis is the record of the sample weight changes, the temperature and the pressure around the sample. The gas sorption in a sample results in its weight change, which is recorded by a precise balance. After an equilibrium was reached, a sorption point was specified. Each of the isotherm was determined based on at least four sorption points. In total, 170 sorption points consisting of 27 isotherms were analysed. On the basis of the sorption equilibrium points, sorption coefficients and sorption kinetics coefficients were specified. Also, the pore distribution was determined based on the Dubinin-Astakhov model (DA) (Dubinin, 1975).\nOn the basis of the results of the sorption analyses, the kinetics of CO2 and CH4 sorption were examined. The researchers looked at the time courses of the sorbent weight changes during sorption and diffusion of the sorbate. In the case of coal, the authors studied a sample sieved to the grain fraction of 0.2–0.25 mm. The use of samples of specific grain fracture makes it possible to determine the equivalent radius for the material analysed and to quantitatively determine the parameter that represents the time aspects of sorption and gas transport. As for the nanomaterials, the analysis of the kinetics was only qualitative.\nThe analyses were based on the assumption that the mechanism of the sorbate emission from the sorbent comprises several stages. That includes the actual process of desorption and diffusion in the pore structure. In the considerations concerning the combined processes of desorption and transport of gas sorbate, which occur during the gas emission from a porous sorbent, it is assumed that within the pore system, there coexist a mobile gas sorbate and a bound sorbate. The transport proceeds with the participation of the mobile sorbate and the amount of the bound sorbate determines the momentary sorption rate. It is assumed that emission occurs with a local equilibrium being maintained. The emission process starts at t0 as a result of a step change of the outside conditions but those conditions remain constant. The accumulation is accompanied by time changes of the distribution of the total sorbate concentration C within the grains. If we assume that we can use a linear sorption isotherm, the course of accumulation can be described using the second Fick’s law:\n∂c ∂t ¼Der 2Co; (1)\nbut:\nDe¼ D\n1þ H (2)\nA. Pajdak et al.\nJournal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering 72 (2019) 103003\nwhere a diffusion coefficient D is replaced by an effective diffusion coefficient De. The value of the latter results from the value of the diffusion coefficient D and the inclination of Henry’s isotherm.\nIf the value of coefficient De remains constant, as a result of the process triggered by a step change of the conditions in the surroundings of the sorbent, concentration Co of the accumulated substance changes from Co0 to Co1, and mass MðtÞ of the sorbate that reacts with a selected fragment of the sorbent increases from M0 to the limit value M∞. In the case of a sphere with radius R, equation (1) looks as follows:\n∂c ∂t ¼De ∂2c ∂r2: (3)\nThe solution of equation (3) takes the following form:\nCoðr; tÞ Co1 Co0 Co1 ¼ 1 2R πr X∞\nn 1\nð 1Þn\nn exp\nt DeðπnÞ2\nR2\n!\nsin � r rπn R � : (4)\nMass MðtÞ of the substance accumulated in a spherical grain increases to the limit value M∞ according to the following equation:\nMðtÞ M∞ ¼ 1 6 π2 X∞ 1 exp � n2π2Det R2 � : (5)\nEquation (5) is often used to assess the value of the effective diffusion coefficient based on the recording of sorbate accumulation through spherical sorbent grains. The effective diffusion coefficient determined on that basis is, in the case of coal, an important parameter in the evaluation of the aspects connected with sequestration and underground storage of carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, quantitative description of structures that differ considerably from a sphere in terms of shape is impossible."

When analysing the TEM images, it was observed that the MWCNTs have a tendency to create large, chaotic groups – conglomerates. The conglomerates are of a size of from a few to over 10 μm, which is shown of Fig. 1a). As can be seen in Fig. 1b), they are characterized by irregular outer surface and they tend to bend. The arrows on Fig. 1b) indicate fullerene endings, which are very rare in the analysed nanotubes. In Fig. 1c) a nanotube can be seen with a diameter of about 18 nm and the wall thickness of 8 nm. The walls of the MWCNTs are not continuous and contain a lot of structural errors. The Fourier transform reveals blurred reflections in the distance of about 3.51 Å, which\ncorresponds with the crystallographic planes {002} with nanotubes coiled around them.\nUsing the BF and HREM images the researchers measured the inner and outer diameters of the studied MWCNTs and performed the statistics of their diameter size distribution. The results of those measurements are presented in Fig. 2. The size of the outer diameter of an MWCNT was mostly in the range of 15–30 nm with a dominant of 20 nm. For the inner diameter, the dominant had 8 nm and the most often measured diameters of MWCNTs were in the range of 6–10 nm.

For CO2 at 258–298 K and for N2 at 77 K. Because coal has specific features such as e.g. wide diversity of sorption capacity, the influence of absorption and swelling, the structural parameters have not, in this case, a physical sense and thus all the structural parameters are treated in this paper as conventional indicators, used to compare the studied materials ( _Zyła, 2000; Kudasik, 2019).\nIn each temperature, CO2 adsorption equilibrium points were identified and on that basis, the adsorption isotherms were determined. Fig. 5 present adsorption isotherms of the studied materials in four temperatures. The sorption isotherms of MWCNT and rGO were of a\nA.

Such a shape of an isotherm indicates that as the concentration of the CO2 adsorbate increases, the active centres gradually saturate and the adsorption decreases.

After N2 adsorption, type III isotherms according to IUPAC classification were plotted for all the studied samples (IUPAC, 1994). The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms are presented in Fig. 6. Such an isotherm shape is typical of mesoporous materials. In rGO sample, capillary condensation of the adsorbate in the multiwall area occurred. In that sample, the desorption isotherm differed from the adsorption isotherm, which led to the formation of a hysteresis loop of H2 type according to IUPAC (Sing et al., 1985).\nOn the basis of the adsorption points as a function of absolute pressure, Langmuir and BET isotherms were fitted. Adsorption equilibrium constants and the limit adsorption capacity were identified. The parameter values of the isotherms and the results of the calculations are presented in Table 7. On the basis of Langmuir (6) and Henry (7) model, the CO2 total sorption capacity was calculated. The value of the sorption capacity accessible to CO2 in the studied materials depended on the measurement temperature. The highest value of that parameter was usually found at 258 K and the lowest at 298 K. The values of the adsorption capacity in the MWCNTs and rGO samples based on Langmuir and Henry models were in the wide range of 0.69–9.31 mmolCO2/ g. According to the assumptions of the Langmuir equation (6),\nadsorption is located on a homogenous surface with no interactions between the adsorbate particles. In the MWCNTs and rGO samples, the very low values of b coefficient and the measurements in the area of low pressures in the gas phase resulted in bp≪1 and the values determined based on the Langmuir equation being similar to Henry equation (7).\na¼ ambp\n1þ bp þ ch (6)\na¼ ambpþ ch (7)\nIn the SOB-coal and BUD-coal samples, b coefficient decreased as the temperature rose and its values were much higher than in the MWCNTs and rGO. In the case of coals, the Henry theory did not reflect the nature of adsorption, producing understated values. The Langmuir total adsorption capacity for coals was at a lower level than for carbon nanomaterials. In the SOB-coal it was in the range of 0.95–1.51 mmolCO2/g and in the case of the BUD-coal - in the range of 0.74–0.98 mmolCO2/g.\nAssuming that the adsorbate particles fill the surface of the studied materials completely, we calculated the surface area of the monolayer SL. It was assumed in the calculations that the surface covered by one CO2 molecule was: ω ¼ 0.170 nm2. The Langmuir surface area of MWCNTs was in the range of 346–980 m2/g and it depended on the adsorption temperature. The higher the measurement temperature the higher the structural parameters. The value of the surface area for rGO was in each of the temperatures almost twice as low and it was in the range of 99–401 m2/g. The values of the surface area of the coal samples were a lot lower. In the case of the low-rank SOB coal (Ro ¼ 0.54%) the values of that parameters were in the range of 98–155 m2/g and in the\nTable 6 Characteristics of SOB-coal and BUD-coal.\nSample Technical parameters Petrographic parameters\nWt , % Ad, % Vdaf , % ρSk, g/cm 3 Ro Vitrinite Inertinite Liptinite\nSOB-coal 5.35 11.54 32.35 1.44 0.54 72.80 16.80 9.40 BUD-coal 1.37 8.4 30.98 1.37 0.95 62.60 27.00 10.40\nFig. 4.

On the basis of the BET model, we calculated the adsorption capacity and the surface area of the SBET multilayer (Table 7). The CO2 total adsorption capacity of the MWCNTs and rGO was at a higher level than in the case of the SOB-coal and the BUD-coal. In the MWCNT sample that value was in the range of 1.67–3.29 mmolCO2/g and in the rGO sample - from 0.92 to 3.23 mmolCO2/g respectively. In the coal samples, the total adsorption capacity BET was in both cases in the range of 0.71–1.56 mmolCO2/g. The parameter of BET surface area of CO2 adsorption in the nanomaterials was in the range of 95–336 m2/g and it was almost twice as high as in the case of coals.\nFig. 7 presents the cumulative volume of the pore space in the studied materials as a function of their diameter, determined according to the HK theory. It assumes a monolayer coverage of the adsorbent surface, depending on the adsorption capacity inside the pore space. Because in the case of the MWCNTs and rGO the notion of porosity does not reflect the actual condition of the surface structure, the authors used\na notion of adsorption layer. In this case, it is understood as an adsorption layer of sorbate particles, covering the surface area of the material completely. The highest pore volume in the whole range of diameters was found in SOB-coal. The value of this parameter in the BUD-coal was almost half as low. In the MWCNTs and the rGO, the volumes of CO2 particles creating the adsorption layer were the smallest.\nThe assumption of only a monolayer coverage of the carbon materials surface is not correct. Hence the authors carried out N2 (77 K) sorption analyses, which allowed them to obtain a full p=p0 range and to investigate the multilayer coverage of the surface. In the calculations, it was assumed that the surface covered by an N2 molecule is 0.162 nm2.\nComparing the results of the N2 and CO2 adsorption analyses, it can be seen that in the MWCNTs and the rGO, the N2 total adsorption capacity BET at 77 K was lower than the CO2 adsorption capacity. However, the difference between those values was not as big as in the case of the coals. It is caused by lower selectiveness of the studied nanomaterials and particularly the MWCNTs toward gases of various sorption potential. The low selectiveness results, among other things, from large inner diameters in the MWCNTs as compared to kinetic diameters of sorbates. A mean MWCNT diameter is about 10 nm, whereas the kinetic diameter of a nitrogen particle is about 0.315 nm, CO2 particle – 0.323 nm and CH4 – 0.339 nm. In coals, the N2 total adsorption capacity BET was much lower than CO2 adsorption. It is consistent with the literature because coal is much more selective than the nanomaterials tested. It exhibits considerably higher ability to adsorb CO2 than N2. Its selectivity is determined by a number of factors such as the potential of an adsorbate to react with coal surface. It comprises van der Waals intermolecular interactions, specific electrostatic interactions and interactions with charge transfer [CT] (Czapli�nski, 1994). Apart from intermolecular interactions in coal, of great importance if the heterogeneity of the pore structure as compared to nanomaterials. Coal contains pores of all types but mainly micropores and ultra-micropores, which are easily accessible to CO2 but less accessible to N2. It is confirmed in Fig. 8 of the cumulated volume of the pore space of the studied materials as a function of their diameters calculated according to the BJH model. That model is based on the Kelvin equation (Klobes et al., 2006) and assumes that the pores are filled with gas following the principles of capillary condensation\nA. Pajdak et al.\nJournal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering 72 (2019) 103003\nunder increasing pressure. As can be seen in Fig. 8, the highest cumulated pore volume with N2 as an adsorbate was found in the MWCNTs. That volume was almost four times as high as the pore volume of the rGO. Comparing to these values, the volume of mesopores in coals was\nnegligible."

The total capacity of the monolayer of SOB-coal is uniquely high for coal.\nThe values of amL coefficient of Langmuir isotherm for CH4 in the selected temperatures for the MWCNTs, the rGO and the BUD-coal were similar and fell within a range of 0.42–0.82 mmolCH4/g.

The distribution of the adsorption layer volume of the MWCNTs was rather inhomogeneous and fell in the whole range of the measured pressures.

This value was selected deliberately and should not be higher so that the gas stream flowing into the reactor does not push the material from the scale pan. The direct measurement results for CH4 are shown in Fig. 14.\nWhen looking at the graphs showing the sorption kinetics of the nanotubes and the reduced graphene oxide, it can also be concluded that the surface accessible to the molecules was covered very fast. The mass changes of the sorbent occurred instantaneously after the pressure change in the reactor. It is not surprising because proper sorption, understood as the change in the number of degrees of freedom of the gas molecules in the vicinity of the sorbent surface is immediate (Gawor and Skoczylas, 2014). The series of phenomena resulting in long observation periods of sorption processes is connected with the transport of gas molecules within the network of cracks and pores of the sorbent. This factor is marginal in the case of nanomaterials but it is of great importance as for typical sorbents such as coal, for instance, where the diffusion of gas molecules toward the target volume of micropores is very time-consuming. The parameter that characterizes the diffusion of sorbate in a porous sorbent is a diffusion coefficient. However, it assumes that diffusion occurs in spherical sorbent grains whose geometry\nA.

Such a short time period (about 1 min) could have resulted from the property of the measurement method. In this case, the quantitative evaluation of the kinetics of the process is not possible. The effective diffusion coefficient in the BUD-coal was determined to be at the level of De ¼ 1.18.10 9 cm2/s – typical of coal. It is so low that for the sorption equilibrium to be established, with the grain fraction of 0.2–0.25 mm, the recording needs to last over 24 h.

Unlike structurally heterogeneous coal, nanomaterials are highly ordered structures. The low pressure adsorption analyses (LPA) with CO2 (258–298 K, 0–0.1 MPa) allowed for the study of the micropores of those materials and revealed that the values of the structural parameters in the nanomaterials and coals differed considerably. Moreover, they depended, to varying degrees, on the measurement temperature. As the temperature decreased, the molecules covered the surface of the materials more efficiently and the values of the measured parameters were higher. In the MWCNTs, the temperature strongly affected the values of the monolayer Langmuir surface area\nA. Pajdak et al.\nJournal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering 72 (2019) 103003\nmeasured using CO2. From 258 K to 298 K, they fell in the broad range of od 346 m2/g do 980 m2/g. In the same temperature range, the value of that parameter for the rGO was over twice as low. In the coals, the Langmuir surface area was at a much lower level and it did not depend so much on the temperature. The values of the BET surface area in the nanomaterials were also almost twice as high. The HK cumulated pore volume was smaller in the nanomaterials than in the coals. The higher surface area/volume ratio indicates that there are more small pores in the nanomaterials than in the coals.\nThe LPA structural analyses with nitrogen (77 K, 0–0.1 MPa) allowed for the observation of the mesopores. The BET surface area in the MWCNTs was 111 m2/g and in the rGO - 48 m2/g. In the coals, this parameter was much lower and did not exceed 19 m2/g. The total volume of mesopores in which capillary condensation occurs, determined according to the BJH model, was the highest in the MWCNTs (0.39 cm3/ g) and in the other materials it amounted up to 0.10 cm3/g.\nThe methane sorption analyses under 0–2.0 MPa (278–353 K) revealed that the nanomaterials exhibited similar, maximum sorption capacities (at the level of 0.42–0.82 mmolCH4/g). These values are close to those of the BUD-coal. In the low-rank SOB-coal, the CH4 sorption was at a much higher level i.e. 0.97–1.61 mmolCH4/g. In the MWCNTs, the b constant of the Langmuir isotherm was the lowest, which resulted in its linear-like shape. The isobars indicated that the sorption capacity in all the materials decreased with increasing temperature. The mean average decrease in the CH4 sorption capacity was the highest in the MWCNTs. The carbon dioxide sorption isotherms show that the MWCNTs and the SOB-coal had the highest sorption capacity. In the other materials, those values were almost twice as low.\nIn the case of CO2 sorption (0–2.0 MPa, 278–353 K), the highest Langmuir total adsorption capacity was found in the MWCNTs (2.27–2.68 mmolCO2/g) and the low-rank SOB-coal (1.70–2.66 mmolCO2/g). In the rGO and BUD-coal samples those values were nearly half as low. During both CO2 and CH4 sorption at various measurement\ntemperatures, the slowest decrease in the sorption capacity caused by increasing temperature was found in the rGO and the BUD-coal (0.45%/ K). In the nanotubes and in the SOB-coal sample, that decrease was more rapid (about 0.65%)\nIn nanomaterials, which are highly ordered structures, gas molecules cover the surface in a different manner and at different pace than in structurally heterogenous coal. In terms of the kinetics of methane and carbon dioxide accumulation, the nanomaterials reached the equilibrium of the sorption points vary rapidly. That rate was many times higher than in the case of the coals and it was comparable to the rate of the quasi-step pressure changes in the reactor. In the CH4 sorption tests, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient in the high-rank BUD-coal was at the level of De ¼ 1.18.10–9 cm2/s (typical of coal) and the same value in the low-rank SOB-coal was De ¼ 1.86-8 cm2/s. The CO2 diffusion coefficient values were 3.47.10 9 cm2/s for the BUD-coal and 2.41.10-8 cm2/s for the SOB-coal. However, the CO2 sorption equilibrium in the coals was established three times as fast as the CH4 sorption equilibrium.\nThe main goal of the article was to compare two types of carbonate materials of extremely different structure. Strongly structurally heterogenous natural coals with advanced carbonate nanomaterials of orderly structure. The authors carried out comparative structural analysis of the surfaces of the materials and the analysis of the dependencies between their structural properties and the course of the mechanism of sorption phenomena. The structural analyses (N2, CO2) and methane and carbon dioxide sorption analyses of were carried out under comparable pressure and temperature conditions of the measurements. The issue discussed in this article is extremely important from the point of view of the application materials of extreme structures in CCS technology and ECBM technologies as well as technologies related to sorption of methane used as fuel (Kwiatkowski, 2013; Casta~nos Calleja et al., 2019).

The authors tested synthetic materials such as multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as well as natural materials such as coals of various ranks. The value of the surface area of Langmuir and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller, in MWCNTs and rGO was much higher than in the coal. The course of CH4 and CO2 sorption of the materials was investigated and the parameters of sorption isotherms in the pressure of 0–2.0 MPa were determined. The nanomaterials reached the sorption equilibria much faster than the coal. The highest total CH4 sorption capacity was found in low-rank coal. The highest CO2 total sorption capacity was found in MWCNTs and low-rank coal. The highest relative mean drop in CH4 and CO2 sorption capacity resulting from the increasing measurement temperature was found in the MWCNTs and the low-rank coal. The authors analysed the courses of CH4 and CO2 sorption kinetics in the materials of highly different structures. The kinetics of CH4 and CO2 accumulation in MWCNT and rGO nanomaterials progressed almost instantaneously, and their rate was many times higher than in the case of kinetics on hard coals.",
