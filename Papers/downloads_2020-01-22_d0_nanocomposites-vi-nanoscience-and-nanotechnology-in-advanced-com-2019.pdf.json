      "text" : "The development, emergence, and increased focus in the selection and use of nanocomposites has in more recent years engendered considerable scientific and technological interest as potentially viable and affordable replacements to not only the heavier and lighter monolithic metals but also their conventional composite counterparts, i.e., the family ofmetal-matrix composites, for the purpose of selection and use in a spectrum of both performance-critical and non-performance-critical applications. A high demand and interest in these composites have been particularly seen in the industries specific to air transportation, ground transportation, high-performance defense-related products, and even commercial products to include electronics and sporting goods. In an attempt to explore the prevailing state of knowledge and aspects specific to research, advancement, and growth by way of selection and use in appropriate applications and to concurrently attempt to bring forth aspects specific to innovation, advances and applications in the domains spanning both nanoscience and nanotechnology for the purpose of engineering the development and use of these “novel”materials, this international symposium, the sixth in a series, was held with the primary objective of bringing to light aspects specific to recent and novel innovations, advances, and applications of the emerging family of nanocomposites. Appropriately, this symposiumwas given the subtitle “Nanoscience andNanotechnology inAdvanced Composites” and was held at the TMS 2020 149th Annual Meeting and Exhibition in San Diego, California, USA (February 23–27, 2020). Overall, this symposium was well represented with abstracts from both the United States and several nations around the world and from engineers and scientists associated with the sectors of academia, research institutions, and industry. This volume contains papers presented at the four-session symposium that was approved by both the Composite Materials Committee and StructuralMaterials Division of TMS.Over 30 abstracts were approved for presentation in the sessions:\nSession 1: Processing and Fabrication of Nanocomposites Session 2: Microstructure and Properties of Nanocomposites Session 3: Processing–Properties–Performance of Nanocomposites Session 4: Polymer and Other Nanocomposites\nv\nIn the four oral sessions, recent advances specific to engineering the development, characterization, rationalization, and properties of the family of nanocomposites were presented. It was clear that every presenter did make an effort to present and discuss new and/or emerging knowledge very much in tune with his ideas. We, the symposium organizers, extend our warmest thanks and appreciation to both the presenters and the participants. We also extend our sincere thanks and much deserving appreciation to the elected and governing representatives of the Composite Materials Committee and Structural Materials Division of TMS for their valued understanding and timely approval of all related and relevant paperwork specific to this symposium.\nOur gracious and generous gratitude coupled with lasting appreciation and recurring thanks are also extended to the following individuals positioned strategically at the head office of TMS (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA):\n(a) Ms. Trudi Dunlap (Department Head, Events, Education, and Exhibitions) for her early interest and involvement by way of observable and much needed attention and assistance. Ms. Dunlap ensured a smooth transition to Ms. Patricia Warren for the purpose of timely execution of all related and relevant intricacies, numerous in number, specific to orchestration, layout, and conduct of the symposium from the moment following its approval all the way until the end signified by compilation and publication of this volume. (b) An unbounded dose of recurring thanks and highly deserving appreciation, of resonating order, is reserved and extended to Ms. Patricia Warren (Programming and Proceedings Specialist) for her infinite patience, valued understanding, and the much desired and needed attention to all of the specifics and intricacies, far too many to list, from point of conception to completion of this technical event by way of compilation and presentation of this impressive bound volume. (c) The timely publication of this volume was made possible by the cooperation of the contributing authors and the publishing staff headed by the dedicated and diligent Mr. Matt Baker (Department Head, Content).\nWe the editors have every confidence that this volume will provide all the readers, to include both the experienced and the new entrant, both new perspectives and directions in their research efforts in the domain specific to nanocomposites. It is anticipated that the sustained growth and resultant demand for nanocomposites will only show a continuing upward trend. Thus, by making possible this symposium we have made every effort to not only aid but also assist material developers in making every possible effort in engineering the safe development of nanocomposites to ensure their eventual selection and use in few to many potential applications.\nDr. T.

Due to these attractive qualities of magnesium, there has been a spurt in the quest of a variety of magnesium materials targeting different functionalities. One subset of magnesium-based materials is magnesium alloy-based nanocomposites that exhibit advantages of both magnesium alloys and magnesium nanocomposites. There has been advancement in this field through careful selection of alloying elements and reinforcement and optimization to obtain the best combination of properties. Accordingly, this paper will focus on the recent developments of magnesium alloy-based nanocomposites capable of replacing conventional materials in multiple engineering and biomedical applications.\nKeywords Magnesium · Alloy nanocomposites · Microstructure · Properties"

These are primarily attributed to a progressive increase in greenhouse gas emissions along with several other factors such as increase in the toxicity in land and water bodies. The extent of these damages is increasing at an alarming rate never seen before in the\nS.

Gupta\nhistory of mankind. In this view, several guidelines are laid out such as keeping the temperature rise to within 2 °C with respect to preindustrial times and to limit the emissions by 2025 to 2 billion tons [2]. While this is an example of the catastrophic problems happening at a global scale, there are also several challenges that a man faces in everyday life such as emergence of electromagnetic smog due to spike in the use of electronic gadgets which poses a higher health risk. Furthermore, with the increase in the ageing population at an unprecedented rate along with a need for materials in biomedical applications that help the patients recover faster without having any effects of toxicity in the human body, there is a need for a paradigm shift in the usage of materials that can help reach all the above said goals. In this view, magnesium serves as a phenomenal material with multiple roles to play. It was ignored to a large extent so far and that ignorance is, in part, responsible for the worsening climate and contamination of land mass and water bodies all over the globe. Magnesium, one of the most diverse metals, has its widespread presence in planet earth and the universe besides being the fourth most abundant cation in human bodies. The key attributes of magnesium are its lightweight (~35% lighter than aluminium, ~75% lighter than steel), its abundance, non-toxicity (a nutritional element for both plants and humans [3]) and most importantly, its recyclability. Over the last 15 years, the price of magnesium has been showing a downward trend making it an increasingly cost-effective option in several applications. Magnesium based nanocomposites have been in the literature formore than a decade as promisingmaterials for aerospace and automotive applications [4]. However, due to their relatively poor ignition and corrosion resistance, and scalability, they have not been explored much commercially [5]. In the recent past, there have been several articles reporting the improved mechanical and ignition response of magnesium with the combined addition of alloying elements and nanoparticles [2, 6–8]. Therefore, it is extremely meaningful to understand the behavior of magnesium alloy-based nanocomposites whose properties and performance depend on both the alloying elements added as well as the reinforced nanoparticles. The multifaceted potential of these magnesium alloy nanocomposites will be unravelled in detail in this paper, and special focus will be given to the engineering and biomedical applications of these materials."

Unlike conventional spray processes, this method employs higher superheat temperatures and lower impinging velocity which helps in achieving a bulk composite material with no-over sprayed powders. Hence, this process offers both the features of (i) fine grain structure and low segregation of reinforcements of spray process and (ii) simplicity and cost-effectiveness of conventional stir cast foundry process. Magnesium-based materials are synthesized by melting and casting commercially pureMg turnings and other alloying/reinforcement additions. This method involves adding the raw material in alternate layers to form a sandwich pattern in a graphite crucible and heating it in an electrical resistance furnace to 750 °C in a protective inert argon gas atmosphere. This method employs vortex stirring of melt at 450 rpm for 5 min. The stirrer used is a mild steel impeller with twin blade (pitch 45o) coated with Zirtex 25 to avoid contamination of molten metal with iron. The melt, released through an orifice of 10 mm diameter, located at the crucible’s base was disintegrated by two argon gas jets that were oriented normal to the melt stream to obtain near equiaxed grain structure. The disintegrated melt was then deposited on the substrate forming an ingot of magnesium-based alloy nanocomposite (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 Disintegrated melt deposition technique [4]\n6 S. Tekumalla and M.

      "text" : "Magnesium alloy nanocomposites with various matrix compositions, such as AZ31, Z6, ZC63, ZC71, and AZ91, have been produced using this method. Ultrasonic cavitation method [9] (Fig. 2a) has been used for improved reinforcement dispersion effects. It employs the transient (in the order of nanoseconds) micro-hot spots that can reach temperatures of about 5000 °C, pressures above 1000 atms, and heating and cooling rates above 1010 °C/s. Such strong impact coupling with local high temperatures will potentially break the nanoparticle clusters and clean the particle surface. SiC nanoparticles reinforced pure magnesium, Mg−4Zn and Mg-(2,4)Al−1Si by ultrasonic cavitation based solidification processing were developed and the experimental findings were promising. Recently, a simple addition to the ultrasonic processing was demonstrated by Chen et al. [10] to synthesize uniformly dispersed nanocomposites containing up to 14 vol.% of nanoparticulates. SiC nanoparticles were introduced in the magnesium-zinc melt and dispersed by ultrasonic processing. After solidification, an ingot was obtained which was evaporated such that the magnesium and zinc melt leaving a high concentrate of SiC nanoparticles. Then the samples were cooled down to room temperature in the furnace. It is reported that SiC nanoparticles self-stabilize in magnesium melt. This is due to the (i) synergy of reduced van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles in molten magnesium, (ii) a high thermal energy of the nanoparticles, and (iii) a high energy barrier preventing nanoparticle from sintering owing to a reasonable wettability between nanoparticles and molten magnesium. The schematic of ultrasonic processing and the evaporation of the melt are shown in Fig. 2b, c.\nFig. 2 Schematic of a ultrasonic-assisted stir casting setup [26]; b ultrasonic processing for nanoparticle feeding and dispersion, and c vacuum evaporation for concentrating nanoparticles in magnesium as demonstrated by Chen et al.

      "heading" : "In Situ Synthesis",
      "text" : "The in situ synthesis method refers to the process in which the nanoparticles are synthesized during the casting process as a result of the reaction between the rawmaterials. It is a very common synthesis technique in aluminium-based materials; however, there has been very little reported work onmagnesium composites processed through this technique. This can be achieved through (i) gas–liquid, (ii) liquid–liquid, and (iii) solid–liquid reactions based on phase diagram principles.Magnesium reinforced by in situ particulates was successfully synthesized using the reaction between pure magnesium and salts, viz., potassium boron tetrafluoride (KBF4), and potassium titanium hexafluoride (K2TiF6) compounds resulting in titanium borides reinforcement particles [11]. Recently, an article [5] suggested in situ synthesizing and processing of magnesium alloy nanocomposites through the in situ evolution of the nanoparticles in the matrix. In this approach, the thermodynamic reactions between the matrix and reinforcements are to be considered and the kinetics play a crucial role in the in situ evolution. For example, in theMg−1.8Y/1.53ZnO nanocomposite, Mg−1.8Y alloy was used as the matrix with ZnO nanoparticles added as reinforcements. During the processing, owing to the thermodynamic reactions, the ZnO nanoparticles dissolution induced the in situ formation of nano length scale rod-shaped Mg–Zn β1′ phase in the matrix. Oxygen released in the reaction forms Y2O3 nanoparticles inMg matrix as shown in Fig. 3. Moreover, the β1′ phase and Y2O3 nanoparticles identified under TEM were shown to range between several tens and hundreds of nanometers. It is analyzed that the kinetics during melt processing at 750 °C led to the in situ formation of β1′ phase and Y2O3. This in situ evolution contributed to the grain size reduction and strengthening of the nanocomposite by improving its yield strength by\nFig. 3 aTEMimage indicating the twodifferentmorphologies (rod-shaped andblockyprecipitates) ofMg–Zn-rich phase and presence of Y2O3 nanoparticles found in an extrudedMg−1.8Y/1.53ZnO nanocomposite; TEM image and EDS spectra of b nano ß1′ phase rods, c blocky ß1′ precipitates, and d Y2O3 nanoparticle\n8 S. Tekumalla and M. Gupta\n124% compared to the monolithic alloy. This mechanism has since then been proposed for in situ fabrication of magnesiummatrix nanocomposites by optimizing the combination of alloying and nano-reinforcement additions that satisfy the thermodynamic criterion to obtain maximized benefit in terms of the properties. Although there has been some exploratory work on in situ synthesis of reinforcements through the use of different reinforcements, there has been very limited amount of work on this subject [12, 13] and several other magnesium alloy nanocomposites, processed through this route, can be explored and studied."

      "text" : "Generally, the solid phase processes yield better strength properties because of minimal brittle interface reaction products. The major solid phase processing methods available includes the blend-press-sinter method. Blend-press-sinter technique is one of the conventional and well-established solid-state processing methods for the production of metal matrix composites. The schematic of Blend-Press-Sinter powder metallurgy method is shown in Figure. The first step involves blending of metal powder together with the reinforcement particles. After blending, consolidation of blended powder mixture is done to obtain a green compact. It is then forged or extruded. The advantage of PM method includes the capability of using different types of reinforcements and possibility of higher volume fraction of reinforcements. The major disadvantage is that this process cannot be used to produce complex shapes. The other limitations include the difficulty in removal of the binder which is normally used to hold the metal powder and reinforcement particles together and the inherent danger in handling the highly reactive powder used in the process (Fig. 4).\nAfter the above-mentioned primary processing techniques, typically the magnesium alloy nanocomposites have been processed using secondary processing such as extrusion, rolling, forging, etc. This is to reduce the porosity and obtain finer microstructures and to increase the homogeneity of the second phases and/or reinforcements in the materials.\nFig. 4 Blend-press-sinter (hybrid microwave sintering) process flow chart\nProcessing, Properties and Potential Applications of Magnesium Alloy … 9"

Owing to the inherent high temperature stability, high strength and high modulus of these ceramic phases, the dispersion of only a small volume percent inMg offers distinct advantages through a combination of different strengthening mechanisms such as grain refinement strengthening, Orowan strengthening, geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) assisted strengthening effects, etc., without adversely affecting the ductility. Figure 5 gives the effect of reinforcements on various magnesium alloy matrices. It is seen that excellent strengths can be achieved through the usage of reinforcements to alloys due to their tremendous load-bearing potentials. Thus, excellent tensile behavior has been observed for alloy nanocomposites without compromise in their ductility.\nFig. 5 Tensile yield strengths of magnesium alloy nanocomposites [4]\n10 S.

      "text" : "A key feature in application of metal matrix nanocomposites in the automotive engineering is dimensional stability over a predicted lifetime at ambient and elevated temperatures. It is established that the dimensional stability is higher if the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material is lower [16]. Thermal expansion refers to the tendency to change shape in response to a change in temperature, occurring through heat transfer. The lesser the CTE value, the lesser the tendency for the material to change shape when the temperature is increased. Thus, a material with lower CTE values is a thermally stable material. Typically, magnesium and its alloys exhibit a coefficient of thermal expansion of 25–27μm/m.K.With the addition of nano-reinforcements, particularly ceramics, the coefficient of thermal expansion alters significantly. Table 2 gives a list of values of commonly used ceramic reinforcements formagnesium. Further, Table 1 also gives the coefficient of thermal expansion values of magnesium alloy-based nanocomposites and it can be seen that just 1.5% of ZnO significantly lowered the CTE of the nanocomposite thereby rendering it more thermally stable."

The nanoreinforcement (typically, ceramics) provides insulating effect that affects the thermal\n12 S. Tekumalla and M. Gupta\nconductivity of the nanocomposite and reduces heat absorption of the reinforcement that affects the specific heat of the nanocomposite. This aids in enhancing the ignition temperature, however, it is to be noted that this enhancement in ignition temperature is only to an extent. Another crucial factor for improving the resistance to ignition is the nature of the oxide layer formed on the metal surface [18]. This is governed by Pilling–Bedworth ratio [19] which is ratio of the volume of the elementary cell of a metal oxide to the volume of the elementary cell of the corresponding metal (from which the oxide is created) and is given by the following equation:\nRPB = VMO VM\n(1)\nwhere RPB is the Pilling–Bedworth ratio, V is the volume, MO corresponds to metal oxide and M corresponds to metal.\nWhen 1 < RPB < 2, the oxide coating is passivating and provides a protecting effect against further surface oxidation. Metals like aluminium, titanium, chromiumcontaining steels fall in this category. Magnesium has RPB < 1, which indicates that the oxide coating layer is too thin, likely broken and provides limited protective effect. When magnesium is exposed to air at elevated temperatures, due to its unstable oxides, the metal ignites rapidly even before reaching its melting temperature. Hence, modification of this oxide layer is equally essential to get an improved ignition behavior of magnesium [20]. The easiest method of modification of oxide layers is through alloying. Alloying with metals with 1 < RPB < 2 such as Y [21], satisfy the criteria of enhancing the ignition temperature due to the formation of a protective and stable oxide layer adhering to the surface of the alloy. Thus, with the synergistic effects of alloying and reinforcement with ceramic particles, a high ignition temperature can be achieved in magnesium alloy nanocomposites. Figure 6 shows the oxidation mechanism of a Mg−1.8Y/1CaO nanocomposite. The formation of such protective oxides along with the presence of thermally insulating reinforcement led to the ignition temperature beyond 1000 °C in the nanocomposite."

Recently, FAA has lifted the ban and allowed the application of magnesium in the interior of the aircraft. Magnesium renders a weight saving of about 33% against Al and about 77% against steels. A comparison of densities is given in Table 3 along with the distribution of materials that are currently used in commercial aircrafts. Replacement of these heavy and dense metals with magnesium translates to reduction in the consumption of fuel and lowering of the aircraft weight coupled with the reduction in the CO2 emissions. An aircraft with a greater number of seats has higher amount of weight and therefore greater amount of fuel burnt per passenger. This shows the extremely critical role weight plays in the aerospace sector. Of late, several magnesium alloy composites have been investigated for their ignition temperatures and the enormous improvement observed in the ignition temperatures of magnesium demonstrates the potential of magnesium to be used in the aircraft industry [7]. It is to be noted that Elektron 21 and Elektron WE43 are already FAA approved to be used in the commercial aircraft in cabin applications [2].

However, the shortcomings such as significantly high EMI emissions and enormous scrap of electronic equipment that is very hard to recycle were realized. Also, it can be added that plastics, generally exhibit poor stiffness and thermal conductivity and bad damping capacity. These attributes are the reason that makes magnesium alloy nanocomposites very lucrative as magnesium can be re-melted, reused and recycled. Its electromagnetic shielding capacity is the same or even superior to that of aluminum alloys as given in Table 4. A key requisite in an electronic equipment that is portable is the ability to withstand elevated ambient/outdoor temperatures and also impact. Magnesium, with excellent stiffness and the best specific damping capacities among known structural materials, is the most viable alternative for these applications. Finally, magnesium also gives a solid looking metallic touch, thereby giving an impression of a good quality and well-graded product [25]."

This is because metals exhibit good mechanical properties (strength, ductility, fatigue resistance and fracture toughness) which are far superior to that of polymers and ceramics. Titanium, steels and Co–Cr alloys are commonly used metallic materials for implant (permanent) applications. Co–Cr alloyswere regarded to be toxic and are being avoided currently. Titanium and steels in general have a disadvantage for implant applications despite their excellent mechanical properties as well non-toxicity due to their very high elastic modulus that leads to stress shielding effects between bone and the implant. Magnesium, in this regard, with its elastic/Young’s modulus (40–45 GPa) closest to that of the bone, is considered to be one of most suitable lightweight bio-material. With bone being a natural composite, magnesium composites stand a great potential in being suitable in the human body. Further, the elastic matching between the bone and magnesium metal minimizes the stress shielding effect to a great extent. The mechanical properties, i.e. strength and ductility of magnesium alloy nanocomposites can be tailored to exceed that of bone which makes magnesium a mechanically suitable material for\n16 S. Tekumalla and M. Gupta\nthese applications. Human bodies need about 250–400 mg of magnesium/day (it is to be noted that Mg is fourth most occurring ion in human body) and it assists in several functions like aiding bone health, multiple metabolic processes in body besides being anti-bacterial. Since magnesium is both biocompatible and biodegradable, it is the best fit to be used in the body as a non-permanent biodegradable implant as it (i) reduces patient trauma; (ii) requires no revision surgery; (iii) reduces doctor’s time; and (d) reduces medical costs. Besides this, the corrosion susceptibilities of magnesium can be used to our advantage. It reacts with simulated biofluids to form localized magnesium ions, increased pH, formation of hydrogen bubbles and a Ca–P layer [26]. With magnesium alloy composites, the reinforcements can be chosen to be biocompatible such that there are no toxicity effects in the body caused due to the reinforcements. Reinforcements like hydroxyapatite, calcium oxide, etc., help in improving the bio-mechanical properties of the material as well as render the material for better biocompatibility. To note here that the corrosion rate of magnesium should be controlled to sync with the healing time of the injury to allow minimal side effects of corrosion, if any. Successful human trials are already made for magnesium-based stents and compression screws while work is in progress for their use as surgical clips and plates. Further efforts need to be made to bring magnesium alloy nanocomposites into the real applications (Fig. 7)."

Surface conditions are held constant whereas diffusivity is allowed to vary slowly corresponding to phase change in the matrix. An analytic solution for variable properties under these conditions is obtained using the Kirchhoff transformation. Penetration lengths are analytically evaluated. A perturbation analysis allows the boundary layer lengths to be estimated, whence the two parameters can be compared. Dimensions obtained by the simulation show that nanomaterial thicknesses are attainable in the boundary layers.

By contrast, self-healing materials appeared later after recent conflicts in the new Millenium spurred by Military research into such materials. Traditionally, “healing” in materials involved the use of high temperature tomelt the affected part and allowflow or diffusion to augment the repair process, sometimes under pressure. For instance, some plastics can be repaired in this fashion. Thermo-sets typically cannot be softened and remolded for repair, whereas thermoplastics are capable of being softened by heat and restored. This suggests that diffusion of heat and matter are involved. However, there are very few papers dealing with diffusion and transport analyses for material repair. This is probably because practitioners are mainly interested in mechanical and physical properties shadowed by fracture analysis.\nHealing has also been studied using the Pennes’ bioheat equation for wounds and tissue damage [1] and with the Stefan approach for polymer capacitors, paints, and self-healing polymer composites.

Unfortunately, as in metals, the weld remains the weakest point and constitutes a site for further future damage [2]. For laminate composites, resin injection is often employed to repair damage in the formof delaminating layers. Fiber breakage in laminated composites is treatable by patch reinforcement to partially restore some material strength [3]. None of these methods of repair is a permanent fix; however, they increase the cost by requiring periodic maintenance and service (Fig. 1)."

      "text" : "consumption for purposeof better fuel efficiency andenergy savings [1]. For example, in a V6 cylinder car, replacement of a cast-iron engine block with magnesium (Mg) reduced the weight from 86 to 30 kg, which in turn promoted noticeable savings in fuel consumption and cost [2]. Similarly, BMWalso reduced the fuel consumption of its model cars by as much as 30 pct. (from 1990 to 2007) using advanced lightweight engine concept [3].\nOf the metallic materials available, magnesium, aluminum and titanium with their relatively low densities (in comparison to steel, nickel and copper.) qualifies for applications requiring a reduction in weight [4]. While the metals and their alloy counterparts have high specific mechanical strength (σ/ρ), their strength properties can further be improved by engineering or synthesizing metal matrix composites, i.e. through the addition of ceramic reinforcements of desired volume fraction to a metal matrix. Extensive research is continuously being conducted in this regard to develop new light metal alloys and their composites [5]. Titanium alloys and composites possess very high tensile strength and toughness (at both high and low temperatures) coupled with a combination of lightweight, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, the high cost and processing difficulties limits their use to selective critical engineering applications [5]. So far, aluminum alloys and composites have been most successfully manufactured and commercialized for various industrial applications and their behavior have been widely studied and applied to different engineering structures [5, 6].\nThe magnesium alloys also exhibit mechanical properties that are comparable with aluminum alloys. Hence, the research and development of magnesium-based materials received an exponential interest since magnesium is ~35% lighter than aluminum. It also possesses excellent damping capacity, machinability and castability, and can safely be considered as a prospective candidate material for future applications encompassing a wide range of engineering sectors [7]. While magnesium and its alloys offer greater degree ofweight savings, the use ofmagnesium in its pure form is often restricted in critical industrial and commercial applications due to their poor elastic modulus, strength, toughness and ductility. To overcome these limitations, it is conventionally alloyed with metallic elements such as aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), zirconium (Zr) and even the rare earth (RE) metals. Despite the development of new alloys, most commercial alloys exhibit low thermal stability and are stable only up to ~150 °C. In this regard, the incorporation of hard and brittle ceramic reinforcements into the magnesium matrix significantly improves the dimensional stability, elastic modulus, strength, hardness andwear resistance. However, the ductility is often compromised. To minimize the loss in both ductility and toughness while concurrently retaining strength at acceptable levels, the addition of nanoscale reinforcements is promising [7, 8]. An efficient dispersion of the nanoscale reinforcements in a magnesium or magnesium alloy metal matrix aids in enhancing dispersion strengthening while concurrently activating non-basal slip for the purpose of achieving superior strength and acceptable ductility.\nIn the present research study, nanosized boron nitride (BN) particleswere incorporated into a pure magnesium (Mg)-matrix using the techniques of solid-state powder metallurgy and the liquid-state disintegrated melt deposition (DMD).

The peaks observed at 2θ = 32°, 34° and 36° diffraction pattern of the developed asextrudedMgmaterials correspond to the (1 0− 1 0) prism, (0 0 0 2) basal and (1 0–1 1) pyramidal planes of the HCP Mg-crystal. Along the cross section, the prismatic plane intensity (2θ = 32°) was maximum in all the cases. This clearly indicates that any of the prismatic planes are aligned in a direction, which is perpendicular to the extrusion direction. Also, the basal plane intensity (2θ = 34°) was found to increase following the addition of nano-boron nitride (BN) particulate reinforcements. This provides evidence that most of the basal planes are aligned parallel to the extrusion direction, indicating a strong basal texture, which is commonly observed in the wrought magnesium materials [9]."

While a higher yield strength under tensile loading results from a difficulty in activation of basal slip coupled with an inability of twinning in the case of strong fiber texture. The ease of tensile twinning under compression loads results in lower compressive yield strength.

Aluminium (Al) with its noteworthy properties, such as high specific strength (σ/ρ), low coefficient of thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity and good wear resistance characteristics is an ideal candidate for engineering the development of self-healing materials. In this paper, shape memory alloy [Ni50Ti50 (NiTi)]-reinforced aluminummatrix nanocomposites [referred to henceforth through the text as SMA-AMNCs] were fabricated using the technique of powder metallurgy followed by hybrid microwave sintering. The intrinsic influence of addition of nanosized particles of the chosen alloy (NiTi) on microstructural development, mechanical properties and even thermal properties of the chosen aluminum are examined. With the addition of nanoparticles of the shape memory alloy (NiTi), a noticeable improvement in hardness, ultimate compression/tensile strength [σ UTS], yield strength [σYS], damping capacity (Q-1) and damping loss rate (L) was observed, with a concurrent decrease in the values of failure strain (εf) and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The observed increase in properties of the engineered nanocomposite as a consequence of contributions from intrinsic microstructural effects is neatly presented and briefly discussed.\nM.

      "text" : "A synergism of lightweight coupled with excellent specific mechanical properties of the aluminum (Al)-based materials has over a substantial period engineered significant attention and resultant action. With noticeable advances in technology coupled with urgent need for lightweight materials for the purpose of both selection and use in a spectrum of applications spanning the industries of automotive, aerospace and even commercial products, the addition of ceramic reinforcements to an aluminummatrix has been critically examined as a technically viable and economically affordable approach to replace the commercial alloys for use in a spectrum of performancecritical and even non-performance-critical applications. Ceramic particle-reinforced aluminummetal matrix composites (AMMCs) have been chosen for use in these sectors owing to their exceptional physical properties and mechanical properties, such as (i) lightweight, (ii) low cost, (iii) high specific modulus (E/ρ), (iv) high specific strength (σ/ρ) and (v) low coefficient of thermal expansion [1, 2]. Several ceramic materials have been chosen for use as the reinforcing phase for the aluminum-based composites, and a few of these include the following: (i) silicon carbide (SiC), (ii) aluminum oxide (Al2O3), (iii) boron nitride (BN), and (iv) titanium carbide (TiC) [3–5]. In an attempt to further enhance the mechanical properties, aluminum-based materials have been incorporatedwith nanoparticles with the prime objective of engineering a composite material. This has proven to simultaneously increase not only the strength but also the ductility of aluminum.\nCurrent research studies have focused their attention on examining the influence of the addition of nanosized reinforcement particles on both thermal and mechanical behaviors of aluminum-based composites [6–8]. The engineered nanocomposites can be tailor-made to suit different applications by an appropriate selection of not only the reinforcement but also the fabrication technique used. In the recent past, metallic glass as the reinforcing phase was considerable importance from a technological perspective due on account of its high strength and hardness, enhanced resistance to corrosion coupled with acceptable to good functionality [9]. Various studies have convincingly shown that uniformly distributed metallic glass reinforcement nanoparticles can simultaneously improve both the strength and ductility of the aluminum-based composites [10, 11].\nThe Ni50Ti50 metallic glass alloy particles are a potential material for use as nanoparticles due to essence to their shape memory effect, high damping capacity coupled with super-elastic properties. A few of the earlier studies have attempted to present noticeable achievements in the mechanical properties of NiTi shape memory alloy-reinforced aluminum (Al) matrix, magnesium (Mg) matrix, and silver (Ag) matrix composites [12–16].

Among the different synthesis methods used for the aluminum-based composites, the technique of powder metallurgy (PM) using an innovative, microwave sintering technique is particularly suitable for the synthesis of composite materials as it provides an excellent control over particle size growth, intrinsic microstructural changes coupled with careful control over volume fraction of the matrix and the reinforcement [19]. Microwave sintering of a NiTi alloy-reinforced aluminum matrix composite has not as yet been reported in the published literature.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no report has been published till date on aspects specific to a study and/or an investigation of the mechanical, thermal, and damping behaviors of Al–NiTi nanocomposite fabricated using the method of microwave sintering followed by hot extrusion. Therefore, the aim of the present research study was to investigate the microstructural evolution, mechanical, thermal, and damping behavior of aluminum nanocomposite reinforced with Ni50Ti50 shape memory alloy nanosized particles."

      "text" : "Recently, metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) are emerging as a novel class of materials to offer metals and alloys supreme mechanical properties [6]. While the strengthening [6, 7] and phase modification effects [8] from nanoparticles like ZrB2, TiB2, and TiC are well studied, it remains unknown how the electrons affect the electrical performance of these novel MMNCs. In this case, while expecting a good combination of mechanical and electrical properties in MMNCs [9], it is important to resolve the dilemma with systematic analyses into the electron behavior.\nTo achieve this goal, many studies of metal matrix nanocomposites consider Al as a model system, because its alloys are widely used as electrical structural materials [10–12] and wire conductors. It’s noticeable that many efforts have been devoted to clarify the effects of nanophase percentage [7, 13] and size [14]. Thereafter, useful theories including effective medium theory (EMT) have been developed to describe the electron behavior [13, 14]. The main problem of these investigations resides in the following several aspects: First, though nanophase percentage and size are important for the depiction of collective electron behavior (e.g. room temperature electrical conductivity), the true interaction between Al matrix with the nanophase is not clear. Second, many experiments interpret the electrical performance from configurational factors including dislocations, grain boundaries, etc. [9, 14, 15]; the electronic parameters like electron mobility are not quantitatively discussed; and the correlation between configurational and electronic factors is missing. Last but not the least, experiments directly revealing the relationships between these electronic parameters have not been conducted and the temperature-dependence electrical performance has not been studied in Al–MMNCs. Therefore, a wide temperature scanning for Al–MMNC electrical properties and an investigation of inter-connected electronic parameters are urgently needed.\nIn this paper, in situ synthesized 3 vol.% ZrB2 are used as the nanophase in Al matrix. Microstructures including grain size and nanoparticle size are discussed to separate their effects on electrical conductivity. By measuring the electrical conductivity from 2 K to 300 K, it is confirmed that the metallic characteristics of electrical properties remained in the Al–3 vol.% ZrB2 nanocomposites. Bymeasuring the electron mobility and (apparent) free electron concentration, the electronic contribution to the reduction of electrical conductivity in Al–3 vol.% ZrB2 is quantitatively analyzed. With configurational factors, a complete picture of how ZrB2 nanoparticles affect thematrix electrical performance is obtained. This study is of great significance to the design of Al–MMNCs for desired electronic applications."

The nanoparticles are pseudo-dispersed, and the Al grains are refined. After obtaining the electrical conductivity, electron mobility, and electron concentration via Hall measurement, the contributions to the reduced electrical conductivity from configurational (i.e. grain boundary, and dislocation) and electronic (i.e. electron mobility, and electron concentration) aspects are separated and quantitatively analyzed. It is confirmed that the altered grain boundaries and dislocations are not the major reason for the reduction of electrical conductivity in the Al–3 vol.% ZrB2 nanocomposites. The major role of the incorporated ZrB2 nanoparticles is to introduce the abovementioned defects that increase the phonon–electron interactions, thus leading to a significant decrease in (apparent) free electron concentration [22]. This understanding can help eliminate the errors and inaccuracy from determining MMNCelectrical conductivity purely by configurational considerations.Moreover, a quantitative determination of electronic parameters in Al–ZrB2 can guide the rational design in MMNC materials for electrical applications.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and MetaLi L.L.C."

      "text" : "Metallic biomaterials have long found numerous applications in the biomedical industry owing to their excellent mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and reasonable biocompatibility. These materials have been extensive as either permanent implants (hip, knee, elbow, spinal disc replacement) or as temporary implants like surgical screws, plates, pins, and clips in orthopedic fracture management. The most commonly used metallic biomaterials are stainless steel, titanium, and Co–Cr alloys [1–4]. Thesemetallic biomaterials are the gold standard for permanent fixtures but come with a few drawbacks in temporary fracture management, namely, stress shielding and non-bioresorbability. The Young’s modulus of the natural bone is 2–20 GPa. The metallic biomaterials like stainless steels (210 GPa), Co–Cr alloys (210 GPa), and titanium alloys (100 GPa) display a relatively higher Young’s modulus values resulting in stress-shielding effects [5]. Hence, due to themismatch inYoung’s modulus, during the implantation, the majority of the load is carried by the stiffer metallic implants rather than being shared by the implant and the bone, ultimately resulting in stress shielding of the surrounding bone [2, 6–8]. Literature dictates the periprosthetic bone loss to have a multifactorial etiology that includes two main causes: (i) stress shielding of bone that can trigger bone resorption as a result of changes in its loading pattern after the implantation of the stiffer implant material in the host bone tissue, eventually leading to complete bone fracture or implant loosening, and (ii) osteolysis occurring due to accumulation of debris in the host bone tissues, caused by excessive wear of implanted materials which may impede the new bone formation [9–11]. In terms of bioresorbability, none of the commercially used metallic implants is bioresorbable. These materials stay in the body for a long time even after the bone has regrown. Inmost cases, revision surgery is required to remove this implant from the human body. In certain cases, the implant is in the human body forever. This approach not only induces severe physical and financial trauma but also impedes the intrinsic mobility of the patient.\nBiodegradable metals such as magnesium (Mg), Zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) provide necessary structural support to host tissues, degrade gradually in vivo, and then completely dissolve after fulfilling the missions of assisting tissue healing [4, 11]. Furthermore, owing to their non-toxicity and presence in the human body as essential trace elements for performing various biological functions,Mg−, Fe−, and Zn-based"

      "text" : "alloys and composites are considered for a variety of biomedical applications.Magnesium, therefore, is a suitable replacement material considering the salient advantages it possesses over the incumbent metallic implant players in the market. Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest structural metal and is the sixth most abundant element in the earth’s crust. Also, it is the fourth most abundant cation in the body responsible for close to 300 enzymatic reactions [12]. However, the Achilles heel of the magnesium research community is controlling its rapid degradation in physiological environments. In comparison to Mg, Zn does not generate gases on biodegradation and displays superior corrosion resistance and excellent processability. Nevertheless, the poor mechanical strength of pure Zn impedes its utilization as biodegradable implant material [5]. On the other hand, when compared to Mg alloys, Fe-based materials possess increased strength and superior mechanical properties but display a significantly slower degradation in the physiological environment [1, 4, 9]. Additionally, the ferromagnetic characteristics of Fe-based materials adversely affect their compatibility for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The elastic modulus of Mg-based materials ranges from 40–45 GPa, closer to that of natural bone (10–30 GPa) as compared to biodegradable Zn-based alloys (90–100GPa) and Fe-based alloys (200GPa) [5, 13]. Considering the aforementioned advantages, this class of metallic biomaterials was recognized as ‘revolutionizing metallic biomaterials’ for medical devices and tissue engineering [14]. Over the past two decades, various attempts have been made to control the degradation profile of magnesium-based materials in the physiological environment of the human body. One of the commonly used techniques is alloying which has proven to be effective in improving the mechanical properties and controlling the corrosion rate. However, secondary phase formation in theMg-X alloy systems can aid in the faster degradation of magnesium. Additionally, coating technology has also been preferred by materials scientists to address the ability of controlled degradation [3, 15, 16]. However, in case of a poorly coated magnesium, the degradation is observably higher due to the galvanic corrosion. Hence, addition of inexpensive biocompatible nanoreinforcements is a cost-effective, viable option to alleviate these problems to obtain better corrosion and cytocompatibility results. Several studies have been done using secondary nanoreinforcements and its effect on the degradation and corrosion behavior of magnesium [17]. It was further understood that better dispersion of nanoscale particles in Mg matrices led to strengthening of theMgmatrices due to their inhibition of dislocation motions. For instance, the yield strength of theMgalloywas seen to be enhancedwith the addition of alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles as reinforcements in AZ31B alloy [18]. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of Mg matrices via synergistic strengthening mechanisms were greatly improved by the addition of numerous nanoreinforcements in Mg matrices, such as alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), yttria (Y2O3) [19], graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) [20], and calcium phosphate ceramic (CPC) [21, 22]. The enhanced property with the presence of bioceramic nanoreinforcements like CPC is encouraging and paves way for more studies to be conducted in this domain. As bone is a bionanocomposite of collagen and hydroxyapatite, using hydroxyapatite as reinforcement in magnesium can be an interesting approach."

This interaction leads to the anodic dissolution of Mg and Mg-based nanocomposites releasing Mg2+ ions into the solution. The higher the rate of dissolution, the greater is the amount of Mg2+ released and higher pH values are observed. However, pH values from day 2 to day 7 for both pure Mg and Mg–0.5 HA nanocomposites reveal steady pH values, and no substantial increase or decrease in the values was observed. The absolute pH values of the nanocomposite were observed to be lesser than that of pure Mg. This suggests that the uniform presence of the HA nanoparticles has resulted in enhanced dynamic passivation of the composite samples from day 2 to day 7, thereby keeping the pH increase/decrease in control.\nThe corrosion rates were calculated as per Eq. 4, where, time conversion coefficient, K = 8.76 × 104, W is the change in weight pre- and post-immersion (g), A is the surface area of the cylinder exposed to the immersive medium (cm2), T is the time of immersion (h), and D is the experimental density of the material (g·cm−3) [12].\nCorrosion rate = K × W (A × T × D) (3)\nThe corrosion rate at the end of day 1 for pure Mg was ~3.9 mm/y. In comparison, the Mg–0.5 HA nanocomposite displayed a significantly lower corrosion rate value of 1.29 mm/y (~67% improvement). The corrosion rates of the samples decreased progressively for both pure Mg andMg–0.5 HA nanocomposites. Mg–0.5 HA nanocomposite displayed the best response with near-uniform corrosion rate from day 2 to day 7. This improvement in the corrosion resistance can be attributed to (a) smaller grain size and (b) formation of a protective film. As seen earlier, significant grain refinement for the nanocomposite would enable the grain boundaries to act as corrosion barriers, hence increasing the corrosion resistance [12]. Note that the immersion process of the samples is governed by the ionic interactions among Mg2+, Cl−, and OH− present in the HBSS as shown in equations [25]."

This anodic dissolution leads to the formation of hydrogen gas pockets at the surface of the sample. pH of the solution and hydrogen gas evolution has a close correlation and can provide a near accurate estimation of the extent of gas pockets formed [26]. Further, a protective magnesium hydroxide layer is formed due to the ionic interaction between Mg2+ and OH−. This results in a decrease in the corrosion rate as the hydroxide layer forms a diffusion barrier between the matrix and the solution. The low radius Cl− ions diffuse through the layer and interacts with the surface resulting in localized pits and with the secondary phases causing micro-galvanic corrosion [8]. Additionally, the nanocomposite degradation releases Ca2+, PO43−, and HPO42− ions which react with the free OH− to form (Ca)3(PO4)2 apatite layer. The primary reason for the growth of Ca10(PO4)6 and (Ca)3(PO4)2 is the degree of supersaturation in the physiological environment. HA, when compared to other calcium phosphates, is the most stable with the lowest solubility [27]. Thus, the corrosion products formed are a combination of Mg (OH)2, MgO and (Ca)3(PO4)2 compounds. To note that high pH andMg2+ concentration can damage the cell viability in a culturemedium and therefore formation of the corrosion products assists in cell attachment to the samples. The current study indicates that the presence of HA nanoparticles can improve the biocompatibility of pure Mg [28]."

Mg–0.5 HA nanocomposite samples improved and accelerated cell proliferation compared to the cell growth on pure Mg after day 1, 3 and day 5 incubation. Nevertheless, after 3 and 5 days, cell proliferation on Mg–0.5 HA nanocomposites was considerably (P < 0.05) higher in comparison to pure Mg. As per the ISO 10993–5:2009 standard for MTT assay, if the cell viability percentage is greater than 70% of the negative control, the material has zero cytotoxicity potential. This suggests that both the pure Mg and HA nanocomposites exhibit satisfactory biosafety with regard to cellular metabolism. This cytocompatibility response is consistent with the low corrosion rates of the samples aiding in superior cell attachment and proliferation and high cell survivability.\nCytotoxicity, indicated by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the culture media after 24 h of incubation, was analyzed in MC3T3E1 cells cultured as shown in Fig. 3b and was calculated by normalizing to maximum lysis (100% toxicity) and spontaneous LDH release or 0% toxicity controls. Cytotoxicity values falling within this specified range are considered nontoxic. The amount of LDH released from the dead cells when lysedwith a diluted detergent is corresponding to themaximum lysis control. LDH assay results (Fig. 3b) revealed a level 0 cytotoxicity (≤25% cell death) for both pure Mg and Mg–0.5 HA nanocomposites samples after 24 h of exposure.

      "text" : "Magnesium alloys and their composite counterparts, due to their low density and high strength-to-weight (σ/ρ) ratio, have the potential to improve energy efficiency and system performance in industries spanning aerospace, automobile, defense, and even commercial products. In comparison with the magnesium (Mg) alloys, the magnesium (Mg)-based composites provide an improvement in hardness, elastic modulus, yield strength (σYS), ultimate tensile strength (σUTS) and elevated temperature properties. However, ductility of the composites is severely impaired by the addition and/or presence of micron-sized ceramic reinforcements in the metal matrix [1, 2]. This results in poor toughness (work of fracture) of the composites. In an attempt to improve the ductility of magnesium and its alloys, addition of nano-sized reinforcements to the Mg-based nanocomposites (Mg–MMNCs) [3, 4] is being both researched and examined. The nanocomposites reveal a noticeable improvement in ductility when compared to the micron-size reinforced composites, while concurrently possessing enhanced toughness [3, 4].\nAmajor limitation of the magnesium-based materials is their lowwear resistance. When twomaterials undergo relativemechanicalmotion, both friction andwear come into force. Wear is often an undesirable loss of material that eventually culminates in catastrophic failure. Magnesium-based materials are viable candidates for tribological applications, such as (i) brakes, (ii) brake drums, and (iii) piston ring cylinder, to name just a few. In these applications, it is important to control both the wear and friction characteristics. A significant improvement in wear resistance has been widely reported for Mg composites with micron-sized reinforcements [5, 6]. However, a major drawback of these Mg composites with micron-sized reinforcements is the occurrence of counter-abrasion by the hard, brittle and essentially elastically deforming ceramic particles [5, 6]. In this context, the tribological performance of nanocomposites is of both scientific and technological interests.\nIn this innovative research study, Mg–5Nb is reinforced with varying weight fractions of nano-silicon carbide (SiCn) ceramic particles made by the technique of disintegratedmelt deposition (DMD). The engineered and/or synthesized composites were then characterized for their microstructure, hardness, and slidingwear behavior. The wear behavior and the operating wear mechanism of the nanocomposite were studied in comparison to that of the Mg–5Nb."

It can be seen that near-equiaxed grains were observed in all the materials, with an average grain size <10 μm. The refined microstructure is due to the presence of both niobium (Nb) and nano-silicon carbide (SiCn) reinforcement particles, which act as heterogeneous sites for grain nucleation [7]. Further, as the hot extrusion was carried out at 350 °C (>0.5 Tm), it facilitated in the occurrence of recrystallization, thereby resulting in the formation and presence of fine and nearly equiaxed shaped grains [3].When compared to theMg–5Nb, addition of 0.25% SiCn did not contribute appreciably to a reduction in grain size. However, for the 2.0 % SiCn addition resulted in an observable reduction in the grains size of the engineered composite. This provides an indication that for 2.0%SiCn content, the nanoparticles act as obstacles for grain growth [7], thereby resulting in a fine-grained structure. Microstructures of the Mg–5Nb composite (Fig. 1a) and Mg–5Nb–SiCn composites (Fig. 1b, c) are shown in Fig. 1.\nTable 1 Grain size and morphology of Mg–5Nb and Mg–5Nb–SiCn composites\nMaterial Grain Size/μm Aspect ratio Roundness/μm Mg–5Nb 9.1 ± 3.2 1.8 ± 0.63 1.9 ± 0.6 Mg–5Nb–0.25% SiCn 9.9 ± 4.4 1.8 ± 0.5 1.6 ± 0.3 Mg–5Nb–2.0% SiCn 5.9 ± 2.6 1.8 ± 0.7 1.6 ± 0.4"

It is seen that the Nb particles tend to form clusters and are not uniformly distributed through the metal matrix. From EDS elemental distribution (not shown here), it was identified that the reinforcing nano-sized silicon carbide (SiCn) particles are present within the Nb clusters. Particle clustering can occur due to processing parameters, such as (i) improper melt stirring time and (ii) insufficient melt super-heat temperature, or due to poor interfacial properties. Interfacial properties depend on wettability of the reinforcing particle with the matrix and bonding between the matrix and the reinforcing particles. It should be noted that based on the Mg–Nb phase diagram, Nb and Mg have no mutual solubility and do not form an intermetallic phase [8]. Hence, the Nb particles will tend to agglomerate during processing due to the relatively high density of Nb [8.57 g/cc] coupled with the absence of chemical bonding between the Nb particles and the Mg matrix. XRD analysis (Fig. 2) reveals the Mg and Nb peaks, along with very low-intensity Mg2Si peak. However, the SiC phase is not visible, probably due to their very fine size and low weight fraction of the particles."

In addition, particles with sharp features are expected to behave as optical antenna by concentrating the local field into a small volume [5, 6]. Plasmonic properties of metallic nanoparticles have potential application in plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy, near-field imaging, sensing and nanophotonic devices [1–6]. By exploiting these novel properties and phenomena at the nanoscale, novel and improved detection technologies can be produced.\nOver the years, a great deal of interest has been directed toward the development of active substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments. Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a surface-sensitive analytical technique that enhances Raman scattering of chemical species adsorbed on rough surfaces or nanoscale structures. It provides s a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. The Raman vibrations of molecules are in general very weak. However, the Raman signature of molecules that are near metal nanoscale surfaces is greatly enhanced in intensity compared to the molecules alone [1, 5, 6]. The most commonly metal nanoscale surfaces are silver and gold which allow chemical detection of analytes at very low concentration with the potential for singlemolecule detection. The enhancement effects observed in the SERS are the results of two different effects: (a) the electromagnetic (EM) effect, enhancement of the local electromagnetic field incident on an adsorbed molecule at a metallic surface, (b) and the chemical effect, due to the electronic resonance/charge transfer between a molecule and a metal surface, which leads to an increase in the polarizability of the molecule [1, 5, 6].\nMore recently, silver [1, 5, 6] and rhodium nanoparticles [7] (NPs) have been investigated for sensing via surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) scattering technique. Bulk Rh–Ag alloys are thermodynamically unstable and therefore do not mix. At the nano level, however, bottom-up manufacturing makes it possible to mix immiscible metals such as Rh and Ag. Nanoparticles also have higher surface-to-volume ratios compared to bulk metals, leading to an increase in reactivity. Rh–Ag nanoparticle alloys were synthesized via the co-reduction of the metal precursors and the ratio of the two metals was altered to vary the final Rh–Ag composition. Rh–Ag NPs also have a plasmon band that stretches into the UV region. As a result, these NPs can also be used for UV plasmonic applications, including the destruction of toxic molecules or label-free detection of biomolecules [7].\nIn this paper, we show that silver–rhodium bimetallic nanoalloy particles can be prepared by a simple polyol approach via the co-reduction of the metal precursors at elevated temperature. These hybrid nanomaterials were evaluated for their ability to serve as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering."

Polyols have high boiling points which allow the synthesis of nanoparticles at high temperatures without the need of using other extraneous experimental parameters, such as high pressure. The metal precursors are often readily soluble in the polyol which makes this a simple and versatile procedure for mono- and bimetallic nanomaterial preparation. Careful selection of the ratio between reactants introduced in the reaction pot and reaction’s temperature can be used for tailoring nanomaterial’s final size and morphology. It is expected that higher temperature would make this reaction more thermodynamically favorable.

The Raman peaks of the SERS-enhanced signal were also slightly blueshifted compared to the native solution. This is probably due to the presence of defects and lattice mismatch between Ag and Rh [10].\nIn Fig. 4, theRaman frequency for the in-plane ring vibrationalmode at 1103 cm−1 for 4-mercaptophenol is also blueshifted ~20 cm−1 when attached to Rh–Ag NPs. This has been reported by others and is attributed to charge transfer or local bonding effects that affect the energies of the vibrational and electronic modes of Raman [10, 11]. For example, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been found to transfer charge with aromatic thiol ligands, such as phenylthiol, where the covalent bond between the ligand and the AuNP leads to an increase in the surface electrons that are responsible for the plasmon band [12]. This is one possible explanation for the observed Raman frequency shift. The peak at 1008 cm−1 doesn’t shift but becomes more intense in the SERS sample. The analytical SERS enhancement factor (EF) was calculated based on Eq. 1 [1, 5, 6, 13].\nEF = ISERS/cSERS IR/cR\n(1)\nwhere ISERS and cSERS are the intensity and concentration of the sample with the NPs, and IR and cr are the intensity and concentrations in the absence of the NPs, respectively.

TheEF for theAgNPswas 5,whereas for Rh–Ag itwas 19, demonstrating that the bimetallic nanostructures are better SERS-responsive nanomaterials. This is due to the possible formation of pinholes in the lattice mismatch which could function as SERS “hotspots” leading to enhanced response."

The company is intensively developing such direction of electron-beam technology:\n– Design and mounting laboratory and industrial equipment for melting of metals and alloys, production of protective coatings, production of composite materials condensed from a vacuum phase; – Production of high purity Ni–W alloys used as seeds in growing single-crystal blades; – Production of titanium alloys for biomedical applications; – Master alloy production; – Production of high-quality ingots from a scrap of high-temperature alloys IS26-VI and JS32; – Manufacturing tubular billets-cathodes fromNi–Cr–Al–Y, Ni–Co–Cr–Al–Y heatresistant alloys for ion-plasma coating deposition; – Production of metal powders for thermo-spray and cold-spray depositions; – Production of electrical contacts; – Production of protective coatings on gas turbine blades.\nNew Electron-Beam Equipment and Technologies … 107\nFig. 1 Unit L-2 (From The Paton Welding Journal, No. 5–6, 2016. Used with permission)\nMany years’ experience opens a possibility to design and build multi-functional electron-beam machine, which can perform a lot of technological processes in one technological chamber and allows to save time and money for the new development of materials and technological processes. Recently, a new semi-production/semiexperimental unit L-2 was proposed to the market, see Fig. 1.\nThis unit allows the realization of four types of different technological processes. The first of them is the coating deposition on various parts in tribune blades, Fig. 2. Three independent water-cooled crucibles with diameters of 70 mm make evaporations independently (simultaneously) of three different materials according to the programmed process. Such a design with strict control gives an ability to get heatresistant, metal, ceramic, single-layer, and multilayer graded coatings. There is a two-chamber variant design for better vacuum keeping. Loaded and unloaded parts in the chamber are performed without vacuum breaking due to the separation of the chamber in two chambers: loading/unloading chamber and technological chamber.\nMicrolaminated, dispersion-strengthened, and microporous types of composite materials produced from the vapor phase allow the unit to perform the second task. At the evaporation from three independent crucibles, the vapor flow is deposited on stationary or rotated substrates with 500 mm in the diameter, Fig. 3. The thickness of the coating can reach up to 20 mm. For easy separation of coated (sintered) material substrate is covered and advanced with thin non-diffusion composition. Standard composition thickness is between 1 and 7 mm (Table 1).\nFig. 2 Schematic of coating deposition on gas turbine blades a side view, b front view (From The Paton Welding Journal, No. 5–6, 2016.

Grechanyuk et al.\nFig. 3 Schematic of production composite materials condensed from vapor phase a top view; b front view (From The Paton Welding Journal, No. 5–6, 2016. Used with permission)\nThe new technological process developed in the L-2 is dispersed metal, ceramic composites, and composite powders.\nAt present much attention is given to the development of thermo-barrier coatings (TBC) on the blades. SPEElteckmash designed and built new electron-beam unit L-8 for TBC deposition on turbine blades. Figure 4 and schematic of the technological process in Fig. 5 L-8 unit are loaded with gas discharge e-guns, and operating life of them is up to 1000 h, and they apply for the deposition of any types of protective coatings: metal, ceramics, composites, with a single layer, multilayers, graded layers. All complex compositions of TBC layers can be formed in one processing circles. There are two loading/reloading lock chambers supplied with ion cleaning of blades before coating deposition in these chambers’ blades can be preheated as well. Here as well, the formation of barrier microlayers with inner heat-resistant layer and outer ceramic layer for diffusion slow down in interfaces also takes place. For controlling coating thickness, there is a sensor mounted on the technological chamber wall along with sighting tube and viewing window for contactless measurements of the item’s temperature. For that purpose, high-temperature infrared pyrometer is mounted on the working chamber rear wall. The unit also supports partial technological gas ionization and metal vapors by applying a negative bias to the parts (up to 2 kV) for better adhesion of the coating and its quality improvement."

      "text" : "The alarming rate of depletion of crude oil coupled with the increasing norms placed on emissions has in more recent years provided the necessary impetus for lightweight materials for selection and use in a spectrum of applications in the industries of automobile and aerospace. Being the sixth most abundant element in the earth’s crust, magnesium with its low density and high specific strength [σ/ρ] promises to be befitting for selection and use in the high-performance industries. However, magnesium does possess a few serious limitations, such as (i) low elastic modulus and (ii) low ductility. In the aviation industry, the low auto-ignition temperature of magnesium is an impediment to its selection for use in key and potential applications [1]. Owing to the recent lift of ban on using magnesium in aircraft interiors, usage of magnesium in an aircraft may significantly increase provided the ignition temperature can be increased [2]. Currently, around 43 pct. of the weight of a seat in an aircraft is comprised of aluminum alloys. Replacing the alloys of aluminum with magnesium offers a reduction in weight as high as 30 pct. In an attempt to overcome these limitations coupled with the need to further enhance mechanical properties, magnesium has been incorporated with nanoparticles, thereby engineering a composite material. This has proven to simultaneously increase both the strength and ductility of magnesium [1].\nNanocomposites can be tailor-made to suit different applications by an appropriate selection of the magnesium alloy, the reinforcement, and fabrication technique used. Such inclusion of alloying elements and nanoparticles in pure Mg has improved the surface reactivity alongwith themechanical propertieswithout adversely affecting its ductility by grain size strengthening and solid solution strengthening mechanism [3]. The drawback with the alloying elements is that they impose extra weight, thereby increasing the overall density of the material and certain elements such as rare earth elements and aluminium induce a certain level of toxicity in pure Mg [4, 5]. This limitation can be overcome by incorporating nanoparticles at lower amounts in the base matrix. Studies show that metallic ceramic oxides like Al2O3, Y2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, ZnO, SiO2 when reinforced in Mg matrix display significant improvement in the strength properties aswell as ductility [6]. Incorporation of rare earthmetal oxides (REOs) including those of the lanthanum series as well as yttrium and scandium into metallic matrices can induce ‘reactive element effect’ (REE), due to their strong rare earth–oxygen interactions [7]. Along with enhancing the protective characteristics of oxides on many metals and alloys, the addition of such REOs also helps in realizing a refined microstructure and good strength–ductility combination in the composites [7, 8]. Further, REOs are thermally stable reinforcements and hence can be used in extremely high-temperature applications [9]. Compared to other metallic oxide reinforcements, REOs offer unique advantages in enhancing the performance of Mg composites which may not be realized otherwise.\nThe currentwork focuses on the synthesis ofMg–Sm2O3 andMg–CeO2 nanocomposites by powdermetallurgy technique followed by hybridmicrowave sintering. The environmentally friendly approach of hybrid microwave sintering helps in achieving\nRole of Rare Earth Oxide Reinforcements in Enhancing the Mechanical … 117\nbetter end-application propertieswithmassive reduction in processing time and costs. Further, it does not require additional inert protection gas for sintering. Accordingly, this paper presents the effect of presence of REOs on microstructural, mechanical, damping and ignition properties of pureMg.Also, the structure–property correlations have been drawn and analyzed."

To produce theMg–REOnanocomposites, 1.5 vol.% of Sm2O3 and CeO2 nanoparticles and pure magnesium were precision weighed in an electronic balance and subsequently blended at 200 rpm for full 2 h (120min) using a planetary ballmill [Model: Retsch PM400].

The difference in the thermal expansion coefficient of Sm2O3 (10.6 × 10−6/K) and CeO2 (8.5 × 10−6/K) nanoparticles with respect to pure Mg (27.1 × 10−6/K) led to lower values of thermal expansion values for the nanocomposites. The addition of thermally stable rare earth oxide nanoparticles in pure Mg contributes in maintaining the dimensional stability of the material [10, 11].\nTable 2 Results of coefficient of thermal expansion of the synthesized materials\nSample CTE (×10−6/K) Pure Mg 26.27\nMg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 24.11\nMg-1.5 vol.% CeO2 22.42\n120 M.

      "text" : "According to the FAA, ignition is the point where the white flame appears and starts to propagate [13]. Although the reaction of magnesium with oxygen is exothermic in nature, and releases substantial heat, ignition may not lead to burning if enough heat is removed [13]. The ignition testing here focuses on the temperature at which the material starts to burn. Table 3 reports the ignition temperature for pure Mg, Mg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 and Mg-1.5 vol.% CeO2 which is 581 °C, 650 °C and 610 °C, respectively. The thermally stable rare earth oxide, Sm2O3 and CeO2, nanoparticles were able to improve the ignition temperature of pure Mg by 69 °C and 26 °C, respectively [10, 11]. This improvement in the ignition property can be attributed to\n(a) the ability of the rare earth oxides to provide a non-conductive interface for heat transfer, (b) formation of protective oxide layer at high temperatures owing to the addition of rare earth oxides which modify the surface of Mg and (c) insulation offered by thermally stable oxides on the surface of Mg.\nIt can be inferred that ignition is governed by oxidative mechanisms [14]. At 440 °C or above, Mg evaporates and reacts with oxygen and forms MgO at the surface of the nanocomposite. This MgO film has pilling–bedworth ratio (PBR) of 0.81 and isn’t strong enough to form a protective barrier and would enable formation of oxide nodules [15]. With the addition of Sm2O3 and CeO2 nanoparticles having pilling–bedworth ratio (PBR) of 1.02 and 1.07, respectively, may result in the change of intrinsic chemistry of the base matrix, hence allowing the formation of rich rare earth oxide layer beneath theMgOfilm in pureMg [15]. This rich protective rare earth oxide layer would suppress oxide diffusivity characteristics and would prolong the\nTable 3 Results of ignition temperature and thermal conductivity for synthesized materials\nMaterial Ignition temperature (°C) Thermal conductivity (W/m-k)\nPure Mg 581 135\nMg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 650 132.97\nMg-1.5 vol.% CeO2 610 133.151\nAM60 525\nAZ61 559\nZK60A 499\nAZ91 600\nAM50 585\nAZ63 573\nZK51A 552\nZK40A 500\nRole of Rare Earth Oxide Reinforcements in Enhancing the Mechanical … 121\nmaterial from igniting early. Also, by incorporating lower thermal expansion coefficient of Sm2O3 (10.6 × 10−6/K) and CeO2 (8.5 × 10−6/K) nanoparticles would provide an insulating effect throughout the matrix [10, 11]. The ignition property can also be correlated with thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity at 400 °C for pure Mg, Mg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 and Mg-1.5 vol.% CeO2 is 135 (W/m-k), 132.97 (W/m-k) and 133.151 (W/m-k), respectively, when calculated theoretically by rule of mixtures [10, 11]. Incorporation of REO reinforcements with lower CTE values decreased the CTE values of the nanocomposites as seen in Table 3 in turn offering better thermal and dimensional stability, thus improving the ignition resistance [11]. With the decrease in the thermal conductivity values, there is a rise in ignition temperature as seen in Table 3. It can be suggested that the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites is directly related to the amount of reinforcement added to the matrix, and in view of the ability of the reinforcement to reduce the availability of the matrix for ignition [10]. Additionally, the fair dispersion of rare earth oxide nanoparticles would delay the ignition by not allowing the heat transfer to take in the matrix across the nanoparticles. The ignition temperature of Mg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 (650 °C) and Mg-1.5 vol.% CeO2 (610 °C) nanocomposite is higher than most of the commercially available alloys like AM60 (525 °C), AZ61 (559 °C), ZK60A (499 °C), AZ91 (600 °C), AM50 (585 °C), AZ63 (573 °C), ZK51A (552 °C) and ZK40A (500 °C) [10] and is, hence, suitable for aerospace applications."

Inclusion of REOs would promote grain alignment, aiding slip as well as deformation twinning. The REO reinforcements assist in hindering the twinning by activation of new slip/twin deformation modes by change in the crystallographic texture in the base matrix, hence improving the fracture strain [10]. Additionally, nanoscale buckling of ceria nanoparticles in Mg matrix aids in dispersing localized stored energy during compressive deformation, hence increasing fracture strain values [11]."

The damping capacity and damping loss rate for the Mg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 nanocomposite sample improved by ~189% and ~346% when compared one-on-one with that of pure magnesium (Mg).\nSeveral damping-related mechanisms are responsible for the observed improvement in the damping characteristics of pure magnesium (Mg) with the addition of REO nanoparticles and these include the following:\nRole of Rare Earth Oxide Reinforcements in Enhancing the Mechanical … 123\n(a) Bulk texture modification. (b) Enhanced damping at the interface binding the REO nanoparticles in the\nmagnesium (Mg) matrix, and (c) High number of dislocations owing to mismatch in the thermal expansion coef-\nficient of the soft and ductile magnesium (Mg) matrix and the reinforcing REO nanoparticles.\nThe damping response of magnesium-based materials can also be influenced by the presence of microscopic defects and porosity. These mechanisms are primarily the result of a combined interaction between these phenomena and not a characteristic effect of each. Further, from Table 5, it is observed that the elastic modulus [E] of the nanocomposite sample increased with the addition of REO nanoparticles. This is consistent with the trend exhibited by magnesium (Mg)-based metal matrix composites [16] indicating a good interface between the reinforcing REO nanoparticles and the Mg matrix."

(c) The observed increase or enhancement in the mechanical properties can be attributed to the conjoint influence of secondary processing, homogenously distributed particles and dispersion strengthening effect. (d) Coefficient of thermal expansion showed a reverse trend indicating an increase in thermal stability. (e) The ignition temperature of Mg-1.5 vol.% Sm2O3 showed the highest resistance to ignition (enhancement by ~69 °C) indicating superior thermal and dimensional stability.

In recent years, a myriad of procedures like emulsion, suspension, precipitation and dispersion polymerization has been demonstrated for synthesizing controlled polymeric microspheres with specific desire properties [3, 8–10] with emulsion polymerization among the most widely used.\nSeveral techniques like gravity sedimentation, vertical deposition, spin coating, electrophoresis, among other techniques have been proven to be very useful for attaining self-assembly of polymer colloidal spheres with vertical deposition technique being the most extensively used. Among the myriad of polymers that have been previously used for the fabrications of colloidal crystals with compact periodic monodisperse colloidal particles, polystyrene (PS) is considered to be very valuable due to excellent properties like lowwater absorbing property, rigidity, low production cost, etc. [11–13]. Many practical applications have been achieved in the industry using this polymer [14, 15]. However, the presence of non-polar functional groups in its chemical structures can limit its usefulness in some practical applications that require the generation of photonic crystals with strong bonding strength with its substrate, among others. Depending on the nature of application that requires the utilization of polystyrene microspheres, functional groups can be incorporated into its structures to suit the required application. For example, Yao Meng et al. [16] generated colloidal crystal coloured films with improved mechanical properties and hydrophobicity from PS spheres by incorporating it with polyacrylate. Also, Jingxia Wang et al. [7] also improved the mechanical strength between the inter-phase of colloidal photonic crystals and its substrate by using hard core PS latex with elastomeric methyl acrylate and acrylic acid shell. Colloidal crystal films with a special FCC structure and tough mechanical strength were simply fabricated using latex spheres with a hard PS core and an elastometric PMMA/PAA shell. In an attempt to improve the properties of polystyrene, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid were incorporated into styrene monomers. This is the first time a correlative study on the influence of butyl acrylate (BA) and acrylic acid (AA) on PS in P(St–BA–AA) latex and that of the conventional PS latex has been studied.\nIn this study, the impact of incorporating butyl acrylate and acrylic acid into the structure of PS microspheres via emulsion polymerization was evaluated by characterizing the as-synthesized PS and P(St–BA–AA) latexes for the fabrication of mono-sized and binary-sized colloidal crystals."

Some of the absorbance peaks in the prepared polymer samples were observed to be similar due to the existence of the polystyrene core in both as-synthesized polymeric samples. The peaks at 696 and 762 cm−1 were observed to be common to both prepared PS and P(St–BA–AA) samples and can be attributed to C–H out-of-plane bending vibration in methylene and benzene groups, respectively. A broad peak ranging from 1443 to 1505 cm−1 corresponding to aromatic C = C–C stretching vibration was observed in the spectrum of PS [18]. A similar absorbance peak was also seen in an equivalent position for P(St–BA– AA) latex, although the peak is split into two.

The emergence of absorbance peaks at 1162 cm−1 and 1725 cm−1 in the spectrum of P(St–BA–AA) could be ascribed to C–O stretching vibration (ester bond) [19–21] and carboxylic acid (C = O stretch) [21–23], respectively.

The spectrum of PS showed a fairly constant rate of degradation from 0 to 382 °C, whereas there was a slight decrease in the weight of P(St–BA–AA) between the temperature of 226 and 382 °C. This could be due to the loss of carbon (IV) oxide and water from the acrylate and ester portion of the terpolymer. As the temperature of 382 °C exceeds, there was a rapid decrease in the spectra of both samples until the temperature reached 382 °C. 14.2% loss in weight was observed during this period. Again, as the heating temperature increased beyond 382 °C, the rate of degradation for both samples further increased until the temperature reached 455 °C. The total weight loss during this period is 84.8%. The TGA analysis, therefore, showed that both samples were completely degraded at 455 °C.\nFigure 1c revealed the XRD spectra of the as-synthesized PS and P(St–BA–AA) samples. Despite the fact that the chemical composition of both samples differs, equivalent absorption peaks with broad nature at position 2θ equal to 20° were observed for both samples.

The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the prepared samples were also evaluated because of the usefulness of thermal stability in determining feasible applications for polymer colloidal latexes. The acquired result sets the Tg of the as-synthesized PS andP(St–BA–AA)microspheres at about 106 °Cand104 °C, respectively. The results showed that the prepared P(St–BA–AA) sample has a slightly lower Tg (104 °C) when compared to the polystyrene latex (106 °C). The reduction in glass transition temperature from 106 to 104 °Cmay be due to the incorporation of the butyl acrylate (BA) unit to polystyrene chain during the formation of P(St–BA–AA) latex. The incorporation of BA to PS has been shown to decrease the Tg value of PS because polybutyl acrylate has a much lower glass transition temperature than polystyrene [26]. These temperature values indicate that the glassy and rigid nature of the synthesized PS and P(St–BA–AA) latexes will habitually be conserved whenever they are applied within 102 °C and 110 °C, respectively. However, their glassy and rigid nature becomes rubbery like or viscous when their glass transition temperature (Tg) is surpassed.\nTable 1 shows the particle diameters, polydispersity indexes and zeta potentials of the synthesized PS and P(St–BA–AA) latexes.

The arrangement of particles from both samples is in line with the polydispersity results shown in Table 1. The observed compact nature of the PS and P(St–BA–AA) crystal film particles has nothing to do with their chemical composition but may be attributed to the reaction conditions used during the synthetic stages of these polymer samples [21].

As such, the bonding of the as-synthesized P(St–BA–AA) colloidal particles with glass substrates was expected to be higher than that of PS latex because of the presence of polar carboxylic and acrylate groups in its structure. The hydrophilic property of the as-synthesized P(St–BA–AA) latex may have also increased the hydrogen bond connections on the carboxylic (COOH) groups in the colloidal latex surface compared with the generated PS colloidal crystals [19]. The insets in Fig. 2a, b is a top surface view of an area in both colloidal crystal films viewed by a wide magnification optical microscope. The parallel lines revealed that there are few defects on the surfaces of the films. This could be attributed to solvent evaporation during the growth stage of the colloidal crystals.\nFigure 4 shows three dimensional images (3D) of PS and P(St–BA–AA) colloidal crystal films. The AFMmicrographs revealed uniform spherical particles that readily assemble into a highly periodic patternwith hexagonal symmetry. The observedmorphology is in agreement with the morphology shown by the scanning electron micrographs (Fig. 3).

Colloidal solutions of the PS (197.3 nm) and P(St–BA–AA) (404.9 nm) mixtures were prepared and thereafter subjected to vertical deposition procedure at 55 °C for the assembly of colloidal particles on the surface of a glass slide. SEMmicrographs revealed that the colloidal particles readily assemble into an ordered periodic arrangement in such a way that the small size PS colloidal crystal spheres are assembled round the larger size P(St– BA–AA) particles in a well-ordered periodic manner. However, the numbers of small size particles were observed to be far more than the larger particles, and as such too many small particles were assembled around them. The formation of high-quality binary crystals may have been hindered by the fact that the colloidal particles used for this fabrication are micrometer-sized colloids as a previous study has established gravity and slow crystallization rates to be responsible for the hindered formation of micro-size high-quality binary crystals [2]. It could also be that the PS and P(St– BA–AA) mixing ratio used during the preparation of the colloidal particles did not meet the required mixing ratio that could generate binary colloidal crystals with the best possible qualities."

Experimental results showed that the as-synthesized P(St–BA–AA) latex wasmore thermally stable than the preparedPSmicrospheres. Furthermore, spherical shaped particles that are readily assembled into a closely-packed three dimensional highly periodic pattern with hexagonal symmetry were generated using both colloidal latexes. Also, the fabrication of binary colloidal crystals with ordered particles was successfully carried out. The results disclosed that the improvement made on the functional groups of PS by incorporating with butyl acrylate (BA) and acrylic acid (AA) generated P(St–BA–AA) latex with a slightly more enhanced properties compared to the as-synthesized PS. This modified polystyrene may be useful in optical devices and decorative materials, such as high-performance reflectors, chemical sensors and environmentally friendly colour coatings.\nAcknowledgements This investigationwas supported by theWorldAcademyofSciences (TWAS).

      "text" : "[3–9]. Graphene is a two-dimensional or single-layer graphite packed in a honeycomb lattice [9–13] with a thickness of one single atom [14], which is thought to be the stiffest [3, 15] and strongest material in the world [16]. Intrinsic graphene is a semi-metal or zero-based gap semi-conductor [9] with unique properties that vary significantly from the bulk graphite and have greatly influenced its incorporation in new technologies [17]. Pristine graphene has amazing mechanical, electrical, chemical and thermal properties (high thermal conductivity approx. 5000 Wm−1 K−1), an ultra-high intrinsic carrier mobility (~200, 000 cm2V−1S−1), large theoretical surface area (~2630 m2 g−1), and high theoretical transmittance (97.7%). All these qualities of pristine graphene make it promise in many applications [9], such as in transparent conductive films, transistors, super capacitors, sensors, and catalyst support [14, 18–23].\nA major encumbrance in the use of pristine graphene material is the difficulty in obtaining the unmodified form and insolubility in all organic solvents, as the modified graphene does not retain the structural quality and exceptional properties (e.g., as electron mobility) found in the single-layer graphene [18, 24]. Graphite oxidation to graphene oxide (GO), via modified Hummers method, and the reduction of the obtained GO to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is the commonest method used to produce graphene, but with distorted structure that cannot be fully restored [24, 25]. Also, rGO is susceptible to aggregation and requires surfactant or strong capping agent to improve dispersion due to its hydrophobicity, and thereby introduces impurity and thus disrupts the electrical structure of pristine graphene as the surfactant is difficult to remove [26–29].\nWithout significant modification, exfoliation of graphene from graphite in the liquid phase can be achieved using both aqueous and non-aqueous systems, in reasonable quantities for research purpose that can be scaled up. Unlike the non-aqueous system, the aqueous system of liquid-phase exfoliation of graphene is cheap, safer and environmentally friendly from the use of water, only requiring the addition of surfactant in order to get the best interfacial tension range for efficient exfoliation. Matching the cohesive energy of liquid phase to the cohesive energy of graphite promotes the separation of graphitic and graphene sheets under shear [30]. Liu et al. [15] and co-worker demonstrated that graphite flakes can be exfoliated to give graphene sheets that are well dispersed in ethanol/water mixture and stable for years without addition of any surfactants.\nThough there are several nanoparticles that are currently used in the synthesis of polymer nanocomposites (PCN), such as clays, carbon nanotubes, silica nanoparticles, nanofibers, etc., graphene is outstanding. Graphene sheets can be used in hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers and can furnish most of the possible merit of nanorange sized fillers [31–33]. The low cost, natural availability, combined with its good mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties makes graphene a choice nanoparticle for use in polymer nanocomposites that can offer possibilities for new material"

As stated earlier, the unprecedented reduction in the elongation in Gr–PUH could be due to the failure at the interfacial region which did not have optimum interaction at the interphase of the graphene nanosheet and matrix of the polymer. Also, there is a reduction in the ultimate true stress in Gr–PUH and Gr–PUM, while yield stress increased in Gr–PUM and decreased in Gr–PUH. There is generally some improvement in the mechanical property of the polyurethane nancomposites (see Fig. 8), which could be ascribed to the impact of the presence of graphene reinforcement."

Therefore, an efficient and economical method for low-level contaminant removal and recovery is needed. The purpose of the research is to improve and modify a newly developed continuous flow ion exchange process for expansion to a variety of non-industrial applications, including removal of metal ions from the Upper Clark Fork River Watershed. The process involves a dual column reactor designed to capture metal ions using 90–105 μm spherical, functionalized silica gel coated magnetite particles, targeting copper ions with future expansion to additional metals, such as manganese and zinc. The optimization of nanoparticle synthesis and dispersion is ongoing with variables that include pH, metal ion concentration, nanoparticle concentration, and temperature. Additional focus involves maximizing contaminant capture, with current values of 0.19 mmol Cu/g Fe3O4 for magnetite and 0.25 mmol Cu/g Fe3O4 for silica-coated magnetite.\nKeywords Magnetite nanoparticles · Nanocomposites ·Wastewater treatment · Ion exchange · Adsorption"

The image at right in Fig. 1 shows a closer view of a three-neck, round-bottom flask used for mixing and sonication of the nanoparticles throughout the process.\nThe first step uses tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the source of silica for the coating and is done under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the magnetite to maghemite, which could be caused by the addition of ammonium hydroxide to the nanoparticle suspension. The first surface functionalization step utilizes methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (CPTMS), and the second functionalization step involves a poly(allylamine) (PAA) solution. PAA functionalization of the silica surface adds adsorption sites to the surface, with future work aiming to target specific metal ions using other resins and functional groups. Each step involves several hours of mixing, washes with toluene or 2-proponal or deionized (DI) water and acetone, and complete drying of the nanoparticles before beginning of the next step. The drying of the nanoparticles occurs using an air stream for evaporating asmuch acetone as possible before placing the nanoparticles into a vacuum chamber. Depending on the size of the container and how often the vacuum is pumped, 1 week or longer may be required to fully dry the nanoparticles. Further details can be found in Continuous Flow Process for Recovery of Metal Contaminants from Industrial Wastewaters with Magnetic Nanocomposites [7]."

The automation system will be adapted to the fourth generation design as well. The fourth generation design features a more compact in-line electromagnet for particle collection.\nThe third generation design, shown at right in Fig. 2, is a dual column PVC reactor. The process outlined in the flow sheet, shown at left in Fig. 2, begins with the mixing of the nanoparticle slurry and metal bearing solution at the top and down the vertical column. The column contains static mixers which aid in maximizing contact of the metal ions with the synthesized nanoparticles. At the first branch, the slurry goes to two wye collection modules. Each module has an in-line electromagnet with core wires within the annulus to collect the nanoparticles. While in collection mode, treated effluent flows toward the center. When the magnet is de-energized, copperloaded nanoparticles are collected and routed for further processing. The double column enables continuous processing, when one magnet is off for nanoparticle removal, the solution is diverted to the other leg.\nFig. 2 Pilot-sale dual column continuous flow reactor (left).

Optimal performance for the reactor hinges on the electromagnetic coil, which separates the loaded nanoparticles from the treatedwater. Thus, being able to produce a magnetic field strong enough to capture the magnetic nanoparticles is imperative to the effectiveness and efficiency of the reactor. The magnetic field strength can be calculated using a simplified equation from the Biot–Savart law in Eq.

Two coils were made for the fourth generation reactor. The coil wire was solid copper with a polyamine polymer insulation. The first coil did not produce sufficient magnetic force to attain acceptable collection efficiencies and the observed efficiencies were less than 80%. The second coil was wound using thinner wire, a reduced inner diameter, and more turns for an increased outer diameter.\nA Gauss meter was used to determine the flux density of the coils, which can be seen in Table 2. The first coil did not reach the 1 kG target, which led to unsatisfactory collection efficiencies. The second coil produced higher flux densities at similar currents, as seen in Table 2, with the target of at least 1 kG being achieved with a current of 9 amps.\nThe second coil was used for the experiments shown in Table 3. Data collected includes nanoparticle mass, initial and final current and voltage, total time, time of brown water observed in the clean stream, and nanoparticle loss to the clean stream.

Due to these attractive qualities of magnesium, there has been a spurt in the quest of a variety of magnesium materials targeting different functionalities. One subset of magnesium-based materials is magnesium alloy-based nanocomposites that exhibit advantages of both magnesium alloys and magnesium nanocomposites. There has been advancement in this field through careful selection of alloying elements and reinforcement and optimization to obtain the best combination of properties. Accordingly, this paper will focus on the recent developments of magnesium alloy-based nanocomposites capable of replacing conventional materials in multiple engineering and biomedical applications.",
