      "text" : "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the highly toxic gases, widely exists in petroleum industry, natural gas, and biological decomposition of organic materials and is extensively used in many industrial processes. Leakage of H2S gas will impose tremendous risks on environment and human health even at a very low concentration. Therefore, rapid and selective detection of H2S gas is of great importance.\n1 In recent years, many types of H2S gas sensors have been developed, such as resistive sensor,2 electrochemical sensor3 and surface acoustic wave sensor.4 Among these, the resistive sensor based on semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures attracts great attention because of its facile fabrication process and excellent sensing performance.5\nVarious semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures6 have been explored to detect H2S gas, including ZnO, 7 CeO2, 8 WO3, 9,10 CuO,11 MoO3, 12 NiO,13 SnO2, 14 In2O3,\n15 and αFe2O3. 16 Among them, the α-Fe2O3 nanomaterials are\nnontoxic, chemically stable, and low cost, which are good sensing materials to detect ethanol,17 acetone,18 trimethylamine,19 NH3, 20 and H2S. 21 It was reported that α-Fe2O3 nanomaterials exhibit good sensing performance for H2S. 16 It is well known that the size, morphology, and porosity of αFe2O3 nanomaterials significantly affect their gas-sensing properties, such as sensitivity, response/recovery times (tres/ trec), selectivity, and stability. Therefore, great effort has been made to prepare different α-Fe2O3 nanostructures to improve the H2S gas-sensing performance, such as flute-like porous nanorods,22 micro-ellipsoids,21 sheaf-like architectures,17 hollow urchin-like spheres23 and microcubes,24 and so forth. The sensing properties of H2S gas sensors based on different Fe2O3 nanostructures reported in the literature are summarized in\nReceived: December 25, 2018 Accepted: March 12, 2019 Published: March 12, 2019\n© 2019 American Chemical Society 12761 DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b22517 ACS Appl.

It can be found that high response values and ppb level detection limits have been achieved using some Fe2O3 nanostructures. However, the response/recovery speeds of these reported H2S gas sensors based on these α-Fe2O3 nanostructures are not fast enough to timely trigger the alarm. In addition, many of these H2S gas sensors do not show good selectivity to H2S gas.\n19 For example, although the porous α-Fe2O3 exhibited fast responses/recovery speeds at 250 °C, there were no significant difference in the response values toward H2S and ethanol. 25\nIn order to enhance the H2S gas-sensing performance, modifications of the α-Fe2O3 nanomaterials using noble metals have been widely reported. For example, Wang et al.32\nprepared a gas sensor made of Ag-modified α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles, which showed a high response value of 220 and fast response/recovery times of 42 s/26 s toward 100 ppm H2S and good selectivity at 160 °C. Balouria et al.\n31 reported that Au-modified α-Fe2O3 films achieved the response/ recovery times of 80 s/180 s to 10 ppm H2S and good H2S selectivity compared to gases of C2H5OH, CO, NH3, CO2, NO, and Cl2 at 250 °C. Although the response values, selectivity, and response/recovery speeds of these α-Fe2O3based H2S gas sensors have been remarkably improved by modification using noble metal nanoparticles, the response/ recovery times are still mostly longer than 40 s. Therefore, it is still a critical challenge to optimize the α-Fe2O3 nanostructures for achieving the best sensing performance to H2S gas with fast response/recovery speeds, high sensitivity, and good selectivity. Nanocrystals of α-Fe2O3 are usually prepared using multiple processes. For example, the precursor of iron hydroxide is often initially prepared using a hydrothermal method,16 a sol− gel method,36 or an electrospinning method,37 and then, the iron hydroxide is calcined to obtain α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals. The increase of nanocrystal sizes is often observed during the calcining process, which will influence the sensing performance. However, there are few reports for using the one-step synthesis method to produce the α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals. In this work, α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids were directly synthesized using a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The H2S gas sensors based on these α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids exhibit not only high response values but also ultrafast response/recovery speeds and good selectivity to H2S gas."

Iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), sodium\nnitrate (NaNO3), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethanolamine, urea, ethyl alcohol, and n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Limited, Shanghai, China, all with analytical purity.\nIn a typical hydrothermal process, 1.616 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 2.0 g of urea were dissolved into a mixed solution which contained 20 mL of distilled water, 9 mL of ethyl alcohol, and 1 mL of ethanolamine under continuous magnetic stirring. After stirring for 10 min, 0.5 g NaNO3 and 0.5 g SDS were successively added into the above solution to form a homogeneous solution. Then, 5 mL of DMF was added drop by drop into the above solution under magnetic stirring, and the solution was maintained under ultrasonic agitation for 30 min. The hydrothermal reaction was maintained at 120 °C for 20 h in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave in an air oven. After that, the red-brown precipitate in the autoclave was washed using a mix solution of deionized H2O and anhydrous ethyl alcohol four times. Finally, it was dried at 60 °C for 10 h to obtain red-brown α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids.\nThe crystalline structure of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα radiation. Their morphologies were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Inspect F50, USA) and a transmission electron microscope ( JEM-2200FS, Japan) attached with selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). Chemical binding information of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids was characterized using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Al Kα radiation. The specific surface area was measured using the N2 physisorption apparatus (JW-BK122W, JWGB SCI. TECH.) and the data were calculated using the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) method.

The α-Fe2O3 nanoellipsoids were dispersed into ethanol and then dip-coated on the surface of the tube to form a uniform sensing layer. The thickness of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid layer was about 20 μm. This tube with the layer of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids was heated at 500 °C for 2 h in air. The detailed configuration of the gas sensor device has been previously reported.11 The sensor devices were placed in a chamber of airproof black box (with a volume of 2 L) for the evaluation of gassensing performance. H2S gas was injected into the black box using a microinjector to achieve the required concentration. The electrical resistances of the sensor were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400), and a computer with a suitable Lab View interface was used to handle the data acquisition. During the measurement, the working voltage was set as 1 V. The response value is defined using the following equation: S = Ra/Rg (Ra and Rg are the sensors’ resistance readings in air and the target gases, respectively). The selectivity coefficient (SAB) of gas A to gas B is defined as SA/SB, where SA and SB are the response values to H2S gas and to other gases\nDOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b22517 ACS Appl. Mater.

      "text" : "3.1. Characterization of the α-Fe2O3 Nano-Ellipsoids. The XRD spectrum of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids is shown in Figure 1. For the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids obtained from the\nhydrothermal reaction, all the diffraction peaks in the spectrum are corresponding to (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (018), (214), (300), (208), (119), and (220) crystal planes of the rhombohedral phase of the α-Fe2O3 crystalline structure (JCPDS no. 33-0664), with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.036 Å, c = 13.747 Å. No peaks associated with other phases are observed, suggesting that the as-synthesized powders after the hydrothermal reaction are pure α-Fe2O3 crystals. This indicates that the α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals with a rhombohedral crystal structure can be directly prepared using the one-step hydrothermal process in this study. As can be seen from the SEM image shown in Figure 2a, the morphology of as-prepared α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals after the hydrothermal process are nano-ellipsoids. These α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids have an average long-axis diameter of 275 nm and an average short-axis diameter of 125 nm. No other types of morphologies are observed. After these nano-ellipsoids were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h, the morphology and size of αFe2O3 nano-ellipsoids are not significantly changed as shown in the SEM image in Figure 2b, indicating that the α-Fe2O3 nanoellipsoids have good stability when annealed at high temperature. In addition, it can be found from the TEM image (see Figure 2c) that the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids after calcination at 500 °C have smooth surfaces without any apparent pores. The smooth surface of the annealed α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids can facilitate fast absorption and desorption of H2S gas molecules, which is beneficial to the fast response and recovery of the gas sensor. As observed in Figure 2d, the lattice fringe analysis shows that the interplanar distance of 0.365 nm is corresponding to (012) planes of α-Fe2O3. The SAED pattern shown in the inset of Figure 2d demonstrates that the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids are crystalline in nature. The BET surface area of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids obtained by N2 physisorption is 12.09 m2/g.\nThe XPS survey spectrum of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids is shown in Figure 3a. It reveals the presence of Fe, O, and C elements. The binding energy peaks at 724.1 and 710.5 eV and their corresponding satellite peak at 732.3 and 718.7 eV in the Fe 2p high-resolution XPS spectrum in Figure 3b are attributed to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, respectively,\n19 which proves that the chemical state of the iron element is Fe3+.27,33 Two obvious peaks can be observed in the O 1s high-resolution XPS spectrum as shown in Figure 3c, which have the binding energy values of 529.2 and 530.7 eV. The peak located at 529.2 eV is associated with the lattice oxygen atoms in α-Fe2O3 and the peak located at 530.7 eV is linked with the chemisorbed oxygen species on the surface of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids. The large peak area of chemisorbed oxygen species in Figure 3c means that there are many chemisorbed oxygen species on the surfaces of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids. 33\nFigure 3d shows the FT-IR spectrum of the α-Fe2O3 nanoellipsoids. The peaks at 482 and 574 cm−1 are corresponding to the Fe−O vibration modes of α-Fe2O3. The peak at 3428 cm−1 can be assigned to the O−H stretching vibration mode of the absorbed water molecules and that at 1632 cm−1 can be assigned to O−H bending vibration of absorbed water.\n3.2. Gas-Sensing Properties. Figure 4a shows typical current−voltage (I−V) curves measured with the two neighboring platinum electrodes bridged by the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid layer at working temperatures from 100 to 340 °C. All the current values are increased linearly with the applied bias voltage increased from −10 to 10 V. Such a linear behavior reveals a good Ohmic contact formed between the αFe2O3 nano-ellipsoid layer and Au electrodes. Moreover, when the working temperature is increased, the conductivity of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid layer is increased, which is consistent with the conduction behavior of a standard semiconductor. The working temperature affects the adsorption/desorption rates of oxygen molecules and target gas molecules on the\nDOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b22517 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2019, 11, 12761−12769\n12763\nsurface of metal oxides and thus affects the sensitivity of metal oxide-based gas sensor. The response values of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based sensor to 50 ppm H2S have been tested at various working temperatures from 26 to 340 °C, and the\nobtained data are shown in Figure 4b. The gas sensor shows the highest response value of 12.0 at the room temperature of 26 °C. However, as shown in Figure 4b, the long response time (30 s) and recovery time (∼787 s) of the sensor for sensing 50\nDOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b22517 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2019, 11, 12761−12769\n12764\nppm H2S make it unsuitable for real-time application for H2S detection operated at room temperature, whereas when the sensor was operated at different working temperatures from 100 to 340 °C, all the obtained response/recovery times are less than 15 s as shown in Figure 4c. With the increase of working temperature from 100 to 260 °C, the response values are increased as shown in Figure 4b. However, they are then slowly decreased with further increase of working temperature. The response value of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based sensor achieves a high value of 8.0 at 260 °C, which is higher than many reported values for sensors made of pure α-Fe2O3. For example, the response values of the sensors made of porous αFe2O3 25 and Fe2O3 films 28 were 1.6−50 ppm of H2S and 5− 100 ppm H2S operated at 250 °C, respectively. Taking into account both response/recovery times and sensitivity response, the optimum working temperature for this study is 260 °C for the H2S gas sensor based on α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids. The high response values of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoidsbased sensor when operated at room temperature can be explained as follows. Besides the chemical reactions between H2S molecules and chemisorption oxygen ions, the formation of iron sulphides (i.e., Fe2S3) on the surfaces of α-Fe2O3 nanoellipsoids because of the reaction between H2S and Fe2O3 is another important factor to enhance the response values of the sensor.27 It was reported that the H2S molecules can generate ions of S2− and H+ on the surfaces of Fe2O3 to form iron sulphides, even at room temperature.39 Therefore, iron sulphides can be easily formed on the surfaces of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids, which results in a much higher response value than those operated at much higher working temperatures. However, the formation rate of these iron sulphides is slow at room temperature, which means that a longer response time is needed. For example, Huang et al. reported that the porous Fe2O3-based H2S gas sensor showed the highest sensitivity of\n38.4 but with long response/recovery times of about 180/3700 s, when sensing 100 ppm H2S operated at room temperature. 27\nWhen the working temperature is increased to above 100 °C, the chemical reactions between H2S molecules and chemisorption oxygen ions becomes dominant.39 More active oxygen ions can form and the chemical activation potentials of sensing materials have been increased with the increase of working temperature, all of which can enhance the response values of the gas sensor. However, at a very high working temperature, the adsorbed gas molecules can be quickly released from the surface of materials before the chemical reaction happens. Therefore, with further increase of the working temperature, the quantities of the adsorbed H2S molecules are decreased significantly, thus resulting in decreased responses.40 Clearly, there is an optimum working temperature for these resistive H2S gas sensors, such as those based on the Fe2O3 film, 28 α-Fe2O3 micro-ellipsoids, 21 αFe2O3 nanochains, 29 and Au/Fe2O3 thin films,\n31 whose optimum working temperatures were reported to be 250, 350, 285, and 250 °C, respectively. Good selectivity is another important requirement of gas sensors in order to avoid interference from the other gases during gas sensing. The response/recovery curves of the αFe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based gas sensor to different gases (including C2H5OH, CO, NO2, H2, CH2Cl2, and NH3) were measured at the same concentration of 50 ppm at 260 °C, and these obtained results are shown in Figure 4d. It can be found that the gas sensor shows insignificant responses toward NO2, CH2Cl2, and NH3, and the response values toward C2H5OH, CO and H2 are also very small, for example, 1.5, 1.1, and 1.05, respectively. The response value of 8.0 toward H2S for this gas sensor is remarkably higher than the values toward other types of gases. The selective coefficients (SAB, which is defined as the ratio of response values of the gas sensor for H2S and other\nDOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b22517 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2019, 11, 12761−12769\n12765\ngases) are 5.3, 7.0, and 7.6 for C2H5OH, CO, and H2, respectively. Generally, when the selective coefficient of a gas sensor is higher than 3, this gas sensor is regarded as having a good selectivity. For examples, the H2S gas sensors made of porous ZnFe2O4 nanosheets 41 and porous ZnO thin films42 showed H2S selective coefficients of 5.3 and 4.1for ethanol, respectively. The nanocrystalline ZnO thin films-based H2S gas sensor43 showed the H2S selective coefficient of 3.48 for NH3 and 2.92 for ethanol. All these abovementioned H2S gas sensors are regarded to have a good selectivity to H2S. For the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based H2S gas sensor in this study, its high selective coefficient value reveals its excellent H2S selectivity. Various factors influence the selectivity of the gas sensor.\nFirst, the different responses of the gas sensor toward different gases are mainly because of the chemical properties of gas molecules. The bond dissociation energy of H−S in H2S molecules is only 381 kJ/mol, which is smaller than those of other interfering gases.44 Consequently, compared to those of the other gases, the H−S bonds in H2S molecules can be easily broken because of the chemisorbed oxide ions on the surface of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids, thus achieving a high response. On the other hand, the higher response of the sensor to H2S than those to the other gases is also attributed to the formation of iron sulphides on the surface of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids, which can improve the response because of its higher conductance value than that of α-Fe2O3,\n42 whereas there is no such effect when the sensor is used for other types of gases. Therefore, the gas sensor based on α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based H2S gas sensor displays good selectivity to H2S gas. Figure 5a shows the response/recovery curves of the α-\nFe2O3 nano-ellipsoid sensors toward various H2S concentrations (100 ppb−400 ppm) operated at 260 °C, and the corresponding response values are shown in Figure 5b. For all different concentrations of H2S, this gas sensor can be fully recovered (e.g., returning back to the baseline) after H2S gas is quickly replaced with air, which indicates that the sensor made of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids has excellent reversibility. It also shows high responses as can be seen in Figure 5b, for example, the response is as high as 33.1 for detecting 400 ppm H2S. Even when the H2S concentration is as low as 100 ppb, the\nsensor still exhibits obvious response/recovery phenomena with a response of 1.2, indicating that the sensor can detect a low H2S concentration down to ppb-level. Furthermore, the response value (S) and concentration of\nH2S (CH2S) are found to have a power law function relation (as listed in eq 1) with a good correlation coefficient (R = 0.9974). This is beneficial for precisely detecting the concentrations of H2S gas.\nS R1.07C ( 0.9974)H S 0.57 2 = = (1)\nThe fast response/recovery speeds play a vital role for realtime detection of the toxic gases. For all response/recovery curves of the sensors based on the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids to various H2S concentrations, the resistance value of the sensor is decreased sharply after injection of H2S gas, whereas it returns to the baseline quickly after the release of H2S. This indicates that the H2S gas sensor has very fast response/ recovery speeds. The obtained response/recovery times are shown in Figure 5c, and all the response times are less than 9 s and all the recovery times are less than 5 s. When the H2S concentrations are increased from 1 to 200 ppm, the response/ recovery times are all less than 5 s. Figure 5d shows the response/recovery curve toward 50 ppm of H2S with a sampling interval of 0.1 s. It is found that the response and recovery times to 50 ppm H2S are only 0.8 and 2.2 s respectively, showing an ultrafast response/recovery behavior of the sensor. Compared with the other reported Fe2O3-based H2S gas sensors listed in Table 1, it is worth noting that the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based H2S gas sensor developed in this study exhibits much faster response/recovery speeds (for example, compared to those based on Fe2O3 nanostructures, 21,25−30 noble metal-modified Fe2O3, 31−33 and hybrid Fe2O3 nanostructures34,35). Furthermore, compared with other semiconducting metal oxide-based H2S gas sensors reported in the literature (some of them are listed in Table 2), the response/recovery speeds of the H2S gas sensor developed in this study are the fastest as far as we have searched in the literature. For example, the H2S gas sensors based on various nanostructures of Co3O4, 45 SnO2, 44,46, α-MoO3, 12,47 ZnO,48−50 WO3, 51 and CuO50,52−56, all showed much longer\nDOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b22517 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2019, 11, 12761−12769\n12766\nresponse/recovery time than those of the α-Fe2O3 nanoellipsoids reported in this study. It is well known that α-Fe2O3 is an n-type semiconducting metal oxide and the surface chemical reactions between the adsorbed oxygen species and target gases are responsible for the gas-sensing performance. Figure 6 shows a schematic\nillustration of the H2S-sensing process on the surface of αFe2O3 nano-ellipsoids. The possible reactions that have taken place on the surfaces of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids are listed as follows47\nO 2e 2O (100 300 C)2(ads) (ads)+ → − ° − −\n(2)\nH S 3O SO H O 3e2 (ads) 2 2+ → + + − −\n(3)\nIn air, the chemisorbed oxygen ions on the surfaces of αFe2O3 nano-ellipsoids are mainly O\n− ions at the working temperature of 260 °C.60 Oxygen molecules are adsorbed onto the surfaces of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids and then transferred into O− ions by gaining electrons from the conductive bands of α-Fe2O3 to form O\n− ions (as shown in reaction eq 2). Therefore, an electron depletion layer with a high-resistance state is formed on the surface of α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids as shown in Figure 6. When the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids are exposed to H2S gas, H2S molecules react with the chemisorbed oxygen (O−), as listed in reaction eq 3. The reaction releases electrons to the electron depletion layers and thus reduces the resistance of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids as shown in Figure 6. In addition, the H2S molecules can react with lattice oxygen on the surface of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids to form iron sulphides (Fe2S3), based on the reaction eq 4.\n28 Fe2S3 has a lower band gap than Fe2O3, which can cause increase of surface conductance.61 When H2S gas is replaced with air, the\nrecovery of Fe2O3 from Fe2S3 will occur because of the reaction of the Fe2S3 with the active oxygen ions of O\n− at the working temperature of 260 °C as shown in the reaction eq 5.28,39\nH S Fe O Fe S 3H O2 2 3 2 3 2+ → + (4)\nFe S 9O Fe O 3SO2 3 2 3 2+ → + −\n(5)\nThe excellent H2S gas-sensing performance of the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based sensor can be attributed to their homogeneous and smooth surface nanostructures, which promote the rapid adsorptions of the O2 and H2S molecules. The repeatability of the gas sensors was further investigated\nby measuring 200 ppm of H2S at the optimum operating temperature of 260 °C, and the obtained results are shown in Figure 7a. It is found that all the response/recovery curves are repeatable without any significant changes, and the sensor maintains similar responses and ultrafast response/recovery speeds within 13 cycles, indicating its good repeatability. In order to prove its long-term stability, the sensor has been\ntested repeatedly for 30 days. The response values are shown in Figure 7b. In the repeated tests for 30 days, the responses of the sensor toward H2S gas with various concentrations (100, 50, and 10 ppm) only show minor fluctuations within a small range. Moreover, comparing the response/recovery curves of 50 ppm H2S measured on the first day and the last day as shown in Figure 7b, the response/recovery curves have not shown apparent differences, and the response/recovery times are 0.8 s/2.2 s and 0.9 s/2.6 s, respectively. Therefore, the H2S gas sensor based on α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids has shown a good long-term stability."

    "abstractText" : "Ultrafast response/recovery and high selectivity of gas sensors are critical for real-time and online monitoring of hazardous gases. In this work, α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids were synthesized using a facile one-step hydrothermal method and investigated as highly sensitive H2S-sensing materials. The nano-ellipsoids have an average long-axis diameter of 275 nm and an average short-axis diameter of 125 nm. H2S gas sensors fabricated using the α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoids showed excellent H2Ssensing performance at an optimum working temperature of 260 °C. The response and recovery times were 0.8 s/2.2 s for H2S gas with a concentration of 50 ppm, which are much faster than those of H2S gas sensors reported in the literature. The α-Fe2O3 nano-ellipsoid-based sensors also showed high selectivity to H2S compared to other commonly investigated gases including NH3, CO, NO2, H2, CH2Cl2, and ethanol. In addition, the sensors exhibited high-response values to different concentrations of H2S with a detection limit as low as 100 ppb, as well as excellent repeatability and long-term stability.",
