Results showed that the adsorption process of OTC was highly pH- and metallic species-dependent. The amount of sorbed OTC at four pH were in the order of pH 8.0 > pH 10.0 > pH 5.5 > pH 3.0 and reached equilibrium around 120 min, indicating adsorption affinity of four species to nHAP followed the order of OTC > OTC2 > OTC± > OTC+. Adding metal ions greatly increased the distribution coefficient (Kd) of OTC between adsorbents and aqueous phases, following the order of Fe3+ > Cu2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+ = Ca2+ in the pH range of 3.0–10.0. Moreover, the co-adsorption behavior of OTC and heavy metals onto nHAP was also explored at pH 5.5 for the first time. OTC adsorption was significantly enhanced with the co-existence of 0.25 mmol/L Cu2+ or Pb2+. Inversely, the presence of 0.25 mmol/L OTC slightly led to the improvement of Cu2+ adsorption and depression of Pb2+ adsorption, yet Pb2+ adsorption was obviously promoted with the co-existence of 0.1 mmol/L OTC. Meanwhile, adsorption of OTC and Cd2+ showed unapparent variation in single or binary systems. The bridging effect involving metal ions, O- and N- containing groups in OTC molecules, and „CaOH or „POH sites of nHAP resulted in the formation of ternary complexes which were responsible for the promotion of their adsorption, while dissolution-precipitation was another key mechanism with the co-existence of Pb2+.\n2019 Elsevier Inc.

      "text" : "Tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) are extensively applied to improve livestock growth as veterinary medicine and prevent infectious diseases in modern healthcare [1,2]. In 2011, the total usage of TCs is 9.7 107 kg in China, accounting for 46% of all antibiotics [3]. Due to their poor absorption and metabolism in vivo, TCs may be directly transmitted into environment through feces and urine as active ingredients [4,5]. To date, TCs as micropollutants have been found in various environmental mediums at the concentrations around 0.13–0.51 lg/L in surface water, 86– 199 lg/kg in soils, and 4.58 mg/kg in animal dung samples [6–8]. The potential effects of TCs on organisms mainly including damage ecosystem functions and productivity, induce antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) and increase adventure of antibiotic resistance gene transfer to human body through food chain [9–12]. Therefore, it is urgent to explore their environmental behaviors and efficient removal techniques.\nOxytetracycline (OTC) which belongs to the member of TCs, is a complicated molecule with multiple ionizable functional groups. Owing to the presence of amine groups and acid/base-active phenolic hydroxyl groups, OTC can undergo protonationdeprotonation reactions, thereby generating four species such as OTC+, OTC±, OTC , and OTC2 under different pH. However, these species show high persistence and good solubility in water, leading to inability to completely removal from sewage in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) [13–17]. What’s more, metal ions such as zinc and copper are frequently applied as growth promoter along with TCs in swine diets, which will induce cocontamination in the environment [18,11,19–21]. Specifically, TCs have different affinities to complex with diverse metal ions (e.g. Cu2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) to form metal ion-TCs pollutants due to the multiple N- and O-containing moieties [22–24], which may affect their environmental behaviors, including photodegradation [10,25], redox reactions [7,26], toxicity [27], and adsorption [28]. Moreover, numerous literatures have reported that it is more difficult to dislodge these co-pollutants from wastewater compared with that of single pollutant [10,29]. Although all kinds of approaches have been applied to remove heavy metals or antibiotics from water, only adsorption is considered as an effective and environment-protecting separation process for simultaneous removal of them [30,31]. Among common adsorbents such as carbon nanotube [1], clay minerals [32], biochar [28], mesoporous silica [30], and graphene oxide [33], minerals have been frequently used as green adsorbents to treat wastewater containing heavy metals and organic pollutants due to availability, low-cost, and high-efficiency [32]. Recent studies also proved that the complexation between heavy metals and antibiotics could promote the retention of them onto minerals and soils. For example, Gu et al. reported that Cu2+ significantly increased the adsorption of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on goethite via forming goethite-Cu2+-CIP surface complex at pH 6.0 [13]. Wang et al. found that the TC-Cu2+ complexes (CuH2TC2+, CuHTC+, and CuTC) had higher sorption coefficient (Kd) onto montmorillonite than their corresponding TC species (H3TC+, H2TC, and HTC ) in the normal pH condition [34]. Further research suggested that the presence of heavy metals enhanced the adsorption of TC on soils through an ion bridging effect in the order of Cu2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+ at pH 3.0–10.0. Conversely, the presence of TC had little effect on the adsorption of heavy metals [23]. Although these minerals exhibited good performance in the removal of antibiotics with the maximum adsorption capacity around 20–200 mmol/kg, the adsorption of heavy metals always remained at a low level with the co-existing of antibiotics. Thus, it is necessary to seek a mineral with high adsorption capacity towards heavy metals for enhancing OTC removal.\nNano-hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, nHAP), a universal inorganic secondary metal minerals, was widely exploited in environmental remediation, novel bone-related scaffolds, and sustained drug release systems [35]. Over the past decades, it has been used as a mature stabilizer for removing heavy metals. Metal ions (e.g. Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) were successfully immobilized in wastewater and contaminated soil through interaction with nHAP to form composite phosphate [36]. Owing to the reaction sites (e.g. „CaOH, „POH, „CaOH2+, and „PO3H ) on the surface of nHAP [14], it has been gradually used to get rid of the single pollution of antibiotics in water and soil. For example, Cazalbou et al. found that the maximum sorption capacity of TC onto biomimetic apatite was 70 mmol/kg at pH 7.4 [37]. Maria Harja et al. reported that the maximum removal efficiency of OTC by uncalcined nHAP was 97.6% at pH 8.0 within 60 min when the initial concentration was 100 mmol/kg [14]. Besides, Li et al. fabricated a newly FenHAP to dramatically enhance its removal efficiency for TC according to strong affinity between Fe3+ and OTC [38]. However, there is still a dearth of knowledge regarding whether nHAP is a promising candidate to control the combined pollution of antibiotics and heavy metals in environmental remediation. To best of our knowledge, the adsorption process of OTC in the nHAP-OTC/heavy metals binary system has not been investigated until now. Therefore, it is well worth comprehensively exploring the co-adsorption behavior of OTC and heavy metals onto nHAP.\nIn this work, the objectives were to investigate (1) the adsorption behavior of OTC onto nHAP at four selected pHs; (2) effect of co-existing ions on the interaction between OTC and nHAP within pH 3.0–10.0; (3) sorption of OTC and heavy metals (Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) onto nHAP in single or binary systems; and (4) the major interaction mechanisms among OTC, heavy metals and nHAP."

      "text" : "The synthesis process of nHAP was based on a modified method [14,38]. Firstly, two starting solutions were prepared: dissolved the Ca(NO3)2 4H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 into the ultrapure water to achieve the solutions of 100 mmol/L Ca2+ and 100 mmol/L PO43 , respectively. Under the magnetic stirring at 1000 rpm, 250 mL of 100 mmol/L Ca2+ was dropwise added into 150 mL of 100 mmol/L PO43 using constant flow pump under appropriate fluid velocity for 1 h at 60 ± 1 C. During the reaction, the pH of the suspension was monitored and adjusted to 11 ± 0.5 by NaOH solution (1 mol/L). Later, the suspension was left to mature for another 3 h at 60 ± 1 C. Finally, the obtained precipitate was filtered through a 0.22 lm membrane, washed with ultrapure water for several times, and dried in the oven at 100 C for 24 h.\nThe hydrodynamic diameter of nHAP was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The morphology and composition of nHAP were obtained by a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDAX attachment (FESEM: JSM-\n6700F, JEOL, Japan). The specific surface area of nHAP was determined by Brunauer-Emmentt-Teller (BET) with N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K. The crystalline structure of nHAP was characterized by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) with mono-chromated Cu Ka (k = 1.5418 Å) radiation. Fourier transform infrared spectra of nHAP were recorded by the KBr pellet technique using a Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrophotometer (FTIR, Japan) in range of 4000–400 cm 1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of nHAP was collected on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA)."

Prior to addition of nHAP, solution pH was adjusted to required value by adding negligible volumes of diluted NaOH or HCl solutions, and the final pH values were also measured. All data were recorded as the average of three duplicate experiments.\nTo investigate the influence of solution pH on adsorptive behaviors (kinetics and isotherms) of OTC onto nHAP, two types of adsorption experiment were carried out at pH 3.0, 5.5, 8.0, and 10.0. For kinetic experiments, 100 mg of nHAP was mixed with 100 mL OTC solution with 0.1 mmol/L of initial concentration. Time intervals of 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min were selected as sampling points. For isotherm experiments, 30 mg of nHAP was added into 30 mL OTC solution with different concentrations of 0.02–0.24 mmol/L.\nTo reveal both co-existing ions and solution pH effects on OTC adsorption, 30 mL mixture of 0.1 mmol/L OTC with different concentrations of co-existing ions (0.25 mmol/L cations: Na+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, and Cd2+; 0.5 mmol/L anions: NO3 , Cl , F , CO32 , SO42 , and PO43 ) were pre-equilibrated for 3 h at pH 3.0–10.0, and 0.1 mmol/L NaNO3 was set to the control group. Sorption isotherms of both OTC and heavy metals (Cd2+, Cu2+, Pb2+) onto nHAP in single or binary systems were also studied. The mixture with pH value of 5.5 was prepared as describe above, but 30 mL mixture were contained: (1) the OTC at initial concentrations of 0.02– 0.24 mmol/L with 0, 0.1 and 0.25 mmol/L heavy metals; (2) the heavy metals at initial concentrations of 0.6–2.1 mmol/L with 0, 0.1 and 0.25 mmol/L OTC. Other operations were consistent with isotherm experiment of OTC.\nAfter adsorption, 4 mL of aliquots were taken from suspension at the set time, and quickly filtered using 0.45 lm of membrane. The aqueous OTC were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1100) on a column of Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C 18 (150 4.6 nm, 5 lm) [23,40]. The aqueous heavy metals were diluted with 4 mL HNO3 (5%) for inductively couple plasma optical emission spectroscopic analysis (ICP-OES, optima 5300 DV) [41,42].The adsorption capacity of OTC or heavy metals (qe, mmol/kg) and distribution coefficients of OTC (Kd, L/kg) were calculated by expressing in Eqs.

      "text" : "The morphology and composition of nHAP were characterized by FESEM and EDAX, respectively. As seen in Fig. 1A, the FESEM image indicates that the nHAP is needle-like shape, 20–50 nm in diameter and 100–200 nm in length. Due to aggregation, the structure of nHAP shows stacked and irregular surfaces with intergranular porosity. Fig. 1B shows that the hydrodynamic diameter of nHAP in suspension is 141.8 nm after pretreating by ultrasound. The main reasons why an overestimated diameter was measured\nin DLS analysis compared with that in FESEM was that the DLS analysis was conducted with the sample in the hydrated state, while in the FESEM the estimated size was performed in the solid state [44]. The corresponding EDAX spectrum of native nHAP in Fig. 1C demonstrates that the Ca/P molar ratio is 1.63 in the presence of calcium, phosphorus and oxygen, which proves the composition of sample as hydroxyapatite. Besides, Fig. 1D displays the full N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore distribution curve for nHAP. The BET surface area and the total pore volume of nHAP are 55.24 m2/g and 0.19 cm3/g, respectively. On the basis of IUPAC classification, nHAP possesses a type Ⅳ isotherms with a hysteresis loop at approximately P/P0 = 0.83–0.99, implying the characteristics of mesoporous materials [45]. The pore size distribution curve obtained by the desorption branch of the isotherms based on BJH model is also inserted in Fig. 1D. It can be seen that the size of pores are centered at 30 nm and not evenly distributed on the whole. The phase purity of nHAP was also analyzed by XRD. From Fig. 2A, the XRD diffraction peaks of nHAP are well indexed to the reference JCPDS file number (No. 09-0423) [46].\nThe FT-IR spectra of OTC and nHAP are presented in Fig. 2B. In the FT-IR spectrum of OTC, the broad band between 3600 cm 1 and 3000 cm 1 were attributed to the H-bonded hydroxyl groups in phenolic and alcoholic groups. The peaks at 1669 cm 1 and 1528 cm 1 belonged to the skeletal vibration of C@O at C2 site and = NH2 at N2a site in ring A (seen in Fig. 5A). The peaks at 1615 cm 1 and 1582 cm 1 were attributed to C@O at C11 site in ring C and @NH at N4a site in ring A, respectively, while the peak\nat 1457 cm 1 was assigned to C@C skeletal vibration. In the FT-IR spectrum of nHAP, the characteristic band around 3567 cm 1 and the peak at 3446 cm 1 were attributed to OAH group hosted by the adsorbed water and nHAP framework, respectively [38]. The peak at 1093 cm 1 or 1035 cm 1 and the peak at 605 cm 1 or 565 cm 1 were relevant to asymmetrical stretching and bending modes of PO43 ions, respectively. Meanwhile, the peak at 962 cm 1 was attributed to symmetric stretching mode of the PO43 ions [47]. Due to the presence of HPO42 , a small peak at 874 cm 1 was also detected."

      "heading" : "3.2. Kinetics of OTC adsorption",
      "text" : "The adsorption kinetic plotted in Fig. 3A as adsorption capacities vs contact time is nonlinear. It is noteworthy that the curves under different solution pH exhibit the similar trend. OTC adsorption onto nHAP rapidly increased within the first 15 min due to the abundant adsorption sites. After 15 min, adsorption rate slowly decreased, and gradually reached equilibrium at 120 min.\nTo understand the time-dependent adsorption of OTC onto nHAP, PFO, PSO, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models were applied to fit the experiment data. The kinetic parameters are presented in Table 1. PFO and PSO are considered to determine the rate-limiting step of the adsorption process at first. Compared with PFO, the smaller v2 (0.96–8.00) and higher R2 value (0.968–0.982) were found in PSO and the values of qe,cal simulated by PSO were more close to the qe,exp values, which implied that OTC sorption\nonto nHAP was uppermost controlled by chemisorption [48,49]. The results of PSO rate constant K2 (kg/mmol min) and the initial adsorption rate h (K2qe2, mmol/kg min), greatly impacted by the species distribution of OTC, were noted as 0.0049–0.0094 kg/ mmol min and 4.19–14.76 mmol/kg min, respectively. The initial adsorption rates under four pH values followed an order of pH 8.0 > pH 10.0 > pH 5.5 > pH 3.0, indicating that adsorption affinity of different species followed the order as: OTC > OTC2 > OTC± >\nOTC+, especially at the beginning of the adsorption process [50]. However, previous studies pointed out that the idea to restrict the fit to only PFO and PSO was unsupported since the adsorption process often took place in complicated adsorbate/adsorbent systems, including often complex molecules, sometimes heterogeneous surface [37]. Therefore, Eolvich model, identified as the bestfitted (highest R2 (>0.990) and lowest v2 (0.23–1.03)) model, was chosen to further illustrate reaction mechanism. In combination\nwith the assumption of this model, we concluded that OTC molecules were primarily adsorbed onto the heterogeneous sites of nHAP via chemical action.\nSince the above kinetic models were unable to describe the mass transfer steps in OTC adsorption, intraparticle diffusion model was further fitted in Fig. 3B. As seen, the plot of this model was multi-linear containing three distinct parts. The first stage (first 15 min) with the steepest segment was mainly ascribed to the transfer of OTC from liquid phase to the external surface of nHAP through film diffusion [51]. Due to the higher affinity of OTC to nHAP, the maxima of k1d (mmok/kg) was obtained at pH 8.0 in Table 1. The second stage (30–120 min) showed a gradual adsorption process controlled by intraparticle diffusion (from external surface into the pores of nHAP). In addition, the intraparticle diffusion started to reach saturation at the last stage (120– 180 min) because of the decrease in the active sites for nHAP. Thus, we found that both film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion existed in the diffusion process. Furthermore, all of the linear plots did not pass through the origin, which also proved that intraparticle diffusion was not the sole rate-controlling step [43]."

      "heading" : "3.3. Isotherms of OTC adsorption",
      "text" : "Two most prevailing isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich) were applied to analyze the data (Fig. 3C), and relevant parameters were calculated and listed in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, Freundlich model presented higher R2 (0.982–0.991) and smaller v2 (0.10–6.22) compared with Langmuir model, implying that the adsorption of OTC on nHAP was heterogeneous with multilayer uptake. Besides, the n values (0.17–0.33) defined as heterogeneity factor is much less than 1, suggesting that adsorption sites on nHAP interact with OTC via weak free energies [48].\nIn generally, the adsorption capacity and adsorption mechanism are influenced by solution pH through changing both the surface chemistry of adsorbents and the ionization state of pollutant. The OTC’s Kf varied from 33.34 to 139.38 mmol1 nLn/kg (Table 2). It was obvious that Kf increased rapidly with increasing pH values\nfrom 3.0 to 8.0, and then marginally decreased with increasing pH values from 8.0 to 10.0. The trend kept similar pace with the pH-regulated distributions of OTC . However, the adsorption capacity at pH 3.0 was about 4 times smaller than that at other pH values, mainly attribution to two aspects: (1) destruction of the embedding calcium triangles structure contributed to the interaction between hydroxyl group and hydroxide ions under acidic medium [50], resulting in the depression of both hydrogen bonding and complexation between nHAP and OTC, followed by the maximum fluctuation of solution pH from 3.0 to 6.5 in Fig. 3C; (2) when solution pH was under PZC of nHAP (6.5–7.0) [14], the surface charge of nHAP was positive and the major species of OTC are OTC+ and OTC±, which might produce a lasting electrostatic repulsion on reaction interface. Combined with Fig. 3C and D, no matter how solution pH was changed between 5.5 and 10.0, the adsorption capacity always floated in a small range. Thus, nHAP is an outstanding adsorbent for coping with antibiotic wastewater at various pH except for strong acidity. At pH > 7.0, the main types of OTC are OTC , OTC2 , and OTC± with higher affinity to nHAP, but electrostatic repulsion is stronger than electrostatic attraction. We speculate that electrostatic forces should play a secondary role in adsorption process."

      "heading" : "3.4. Metal ions ─ OTC interaction in solution",
      "text" : "The interaction between OTC and metal ions was studied via spectroscopic measurements. UV–vis spectra and reaction mechanisms of OTC-metal complexes are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3. As shown in Fig. 4, different degrees of spectral redshifts were observed in mixed systems due to the significant intramolecular charge transfer between OTC and metal ions [28]. Literatures have reported that TCs’ A ring chromophore contributed to the adsorption band at 250–300 nm, meanwhile the BCD ring chromophore contributed to the adsorption band at both 250–300 and 340– 380 nm [7,52]. It was pretty clear that the absorbance of OTCFe3+ complexes increased significantly around 250–300 nm within all pH values, but decreased slightly around 340–380 nm because\nof OTC’s self-degradation accelerated by Fe3+ [7]. Thus, Fe3+ likely complexes with A ring at O3-O2a site when O3 atom becomes the first donor group, or at N4a-O12a site until the deprotonation of C4 dimethylammonium group, but shows no apparent impact on BCD ring (Table 3). Significant redshifts of OTC-Cu2+ complexes were found around both 250–300 and 340–380 nm except pH 3.0 (seen in Fig. 4A), in which the stability constant of CuH2OTC2+ was under a lower level (log KCu,OTC = 5.02) at pH 3.0 so that UV– vis spectra could not detect the discernible ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). As discussed by Jezowska-Bojczuk and Jin [10,53], it could be inferred that O3-O2a site firstly bound with Cu2+ at low pH, with CuH2OTC2+ as the unstable species. When solution pH was raised, CuHOTC+ or CuOTC± was preferentially substituted for CuH2OTC2+, and chelation then converted to the O11-O12 site. If the ratio of copper ions to OTC was greater than 1, the O3-O2a site of CuHOTC+ and the N4a-O12a site of CuOTC± might further bind with free copper ions to form 1:2 ligand-to-metal complexes, with Cu2HOTC3+ and Cu2OTC2+ as the ultimate species, respectively. For OTC-Pb2+ complexes, their significant redshifts were only detected at 340–380 nm adsorption band under pH 8.0, suggesting that Pb2+ could only complex at the O11-O12 site in ring BCD, with PbOTC± as the unique complexes [54]. Based on Pearson’s Hard-Soft-AcidBase (HSAB) theory [55], ligands such as phenolic-diketone group and tricarbonyl group in OTC molecule would be served as soft bases owning to their large ionic radius and strong polarizability of conjugated electron clouds. Hence, Lewis acids such as Fe3+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ could coordinate with these soft bases in antibiotics molecules.\nAlthough complete overlap of absorbance and peak locations occurred in both OTC-Ca2+ (KCa,OTC = 106.44) complexes and OTCCd2+ complexes (KCd,OTC = 106.9) due to weak iron-chelation activity, the complexes like Ca2OTC2+ and CdOTC±, were also found in previous literature [48,56,57]. For example, Ca2+ chelated easily with OTC2 to form complexes with less protons through pHmetric titration analysis [56]. More specifically, Ca2+ would bond with TC to form a 1:2 ligand-to-metal complex via chelation with O11-O12 site resulting in the extended conformation A of TC, and then bound with OH12a and N4a sites through hydrogen bonding to relieve the steric crowding [57]. Just like OTC-Pb2+ complexes, Cd2+ would also complex with O11-O12 site of OTC2 to form a unstable complex, such as CdOTC± [48,54]."

      "heading" : "3.5. Effect of co-existing ions on OTC adsorption",
      "text" : "The distribution coefficients (Kd, L/kg) of OTC were calculated in the presence of cations at 0.25 mmol/L or anions at 0.5 mml/L with the solution pH values ranging from 3.0 to 10.0. The adsorption envelopes for OTC onto nHAP in the presence of co-existing ions were bell shaped in generally. As showed in Fig. 5B, the promotion in Kd influenced by the six cations had the order of Fe3+ > Cu2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+ = Ca2+ = Na+, which was highly dependent on their complexation affinity with OTC. Xu et al. reported that the predominant surface sites in nHAP suspension were „POH at pH < PZC and„CaOH at pH > PZC, respectively, whereas„PO and„CaOH2+ became significant at pH near PZC [58]. Thus, OTC could be adsorbed onto „CaOH2+ and „POH mainly via cationic exchange\nwith Ca2+ and H+ at pH < 7.0, and complex with „CaOH to form insoluble Ca2OTC2+ and CaOTC± complexes at pH > 7.0. When Fe3+ or Cu2+ presented in the solution, Kd values were increased by two orders of magnitude at pH < 6.0, and then dropped dramatically at pH > 6.0. According to previous literatures [58,59], with the co-existence of metal ions (Men+ represents Fe3+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+), the following interactions may occur:\nBPOH + Menþ = BPOMeðn 1Þþ + Hþ ð9Þ\nBPO + Menþ = BPOMeðn 1Þþ ð10Þ\nBCaOH + Menþ = BCaOMeðn 1Þþ + Hþ ð11Þ Therefore, Men+ could act as a bridge ion between OTC and nHAP\nto form insoluble nHAP-Me-OTC ternary complexes, resulting in reinforcing the liquid-solid separation of OTC from aqueous media. The influence of metal ions on OTC adsorption might include three possible mechanisms: (1) 1:1 or 1:2 ligand-to-metal complexes had stronger affinity with nHAP than either OTC species alone; (2) at pH < 7.0, metal ions might be firstly adsorbed on surface sites via ion-exchange to form nHAP-Me while part of OTC was also loaded on the surface through weak free energies, and then the\nnHAP-Me further adsorbed OTC to form stability complexes due to stronger affinity. (3) at pH > 7.0, the soluble complexes, such as Cu2HOTC3+ ,Cu2OTC2+ and PbOTC±, could be captured onto the negatively charged surface of nHAP via electrostatic attraction. In addition, the tendency of Kdmay be greatly impacted by the solubility product constant (e.g. Ksp(Fe3+) = 4.0 10 38; Ksp(Cu2+) = 4.8 10 20; Ksp(Pb2+) = 1.0 10 16), because the degree of metal precipitation is in an inverse ratio of Ksp value. As the pH gradually changed from acidic to alkaline, Men+ might gradually precipitate to formMe(OH)n+ in solution, so that in turn impeded the promotion effect. According to the study ofMavropoulos et al. [59], only part of Pb2+ (20–30%) were adsorbed on the surface by ion-exchange or complexation, and a two-stagemechanism including nHAP dissolution and hydroxypyromorphite (HP) precipitation was actually the controlling step for lead immobilization, which could be described by following interactions:\nDissolution: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 14Hþ !10Ca2þ +6H2(PO4) 1 + 2H2O ð12Þ\nPrecipitation: 10Pb2þ + 6H2(PO4) 1 + 2H2O!14Hþ +Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2 ð13Þ\nAfter introduction into the reaction system, OTC molecules had more opportunities to interact with the adsorption sites during nHAP dissolution, and then the relevant complexes including Ca2OTC2+, CaOTC±, and PbOTC± might be sequestrated into crystal lattice during HP precipitation and re-arranged to form solid solutions. As opposed to other systems, Kd’s tendency of nHAPOTC/Cd2+ remained unchanged, which might be related to the similar stability constant compared with Ca2+.\nIt is well-known that anions could not complex with OTC species. However, SO42 and CO32 would replace structural PO43 to form Ca10(PO4,SO4)6(OH)2 and Ca10(PO4,CO3)6(OH)2, respectively. Meanwhile F and Cl would isomorphous substitute for structural OH to form fluorapatite (FA, Ca10(PO4)6F2) and chlorapatite (CA, Ca10(PO4)6Cl2). As shown in Fig. 5C, Kd reduction for OTC adsorption generally followed an order of PO43 > SO42 > CO32 = F = Cl > NO3 . This phenomenon was quite common in Hofmeister effect, both at interfaces and in solution medium [60]. In our case, the presence of PO43 and SO42 could significantly inhibit OTC adsorption, because PO43 and SO42 were easier to compete with OTC to approach superficial Ca2+ [50,61], and then held back the formation of nHAP-OTC binary complexes, especially compared with anion species (OTC and OTC2 ) at pH > 7.0. In contrast, the low-affinity ligands such as CO32 , F and Cl exerted a minor inhibition to OTC adsorption. It was likely that solution pH might occupy the leading status compared with the disturbance of the three anions."

      "heading" : "3.6. Mutual effects of OTC and heavy metal on adsorption isotherms",
      "text" : "Up to now, little is known about the influence of heavy metal on organics adsorption, and conversely organics, to heavy metal adsorption on apatite. Therefore, nHAP was adopted as adsorbent\nto illuminate their mutual effects on adsorption isotherms. Adsorption isotherms of OTC and heavy metals in single or binary systems are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. Meanwhile the corresponding parameters calculated by Langmuir and Freundlich models are also listed in Table 2. No matter in single or binary systems, the adsorption of OTC onto nHAP was Freundlich type (R2 > 0.98, and 6.0 < v2 < 44.0), and the adsorption of heavy metals onto nHAP was Langmuir type (R2 > 0.98, and 20.0 < v2 < 125.0). Besides, the binary systems showed different adsorption performances by means of antagonistic, neutral, and synergistic effects.\nAs shown in Figs. 6A and 7A, the addition of Cu2+ dramatically facilitated OTC adsorption on nHAP, and the presence of OTC also enhanced Cu2+ adsorption on nHAP with minor variation at pH 5.5, which indicated the synergistic effect on adsorption isotherms between OTC and Cu2+. The similar phenomenon was found on goethite, montmorillonite, and mesoporous silica [13,30,34], showing discrepancy with biochar and chitosan [28,62]. As shown in Table 2, the maximum Freundlich parameter (Kf) of OTC onto nHAP was 411.16 mmol1 nLn/kg in the presence of Cu2+, which was about 3.4 times than that in single system, with Kf value of 120.96 mmol1 nLn/kg. Conversely, the maximum sorption amount (qmax) of Cu2+ to nHAP was 865.89 mmol/kg in the presence of OTC, with an increase of 114.2% in qmax values compared with single system. Despite this, the n values of OTC (Freundlich fit) in binary systems were smaller than those in OTC alone system, but the b values of Cu2+ (Langmuir fit) in binary systems were larger than those in Cu2+ alone system. The above comparison revealed that the OTCCu2+ complexes (e.g. CuOTC0 and CuHOTC+) would have higher affinity to nHAP than OTC and Cu2+ separately.\nUnlike Cu2+, although the addition of Pb2+ also considerably enhanced OTC adsorption on nHAP with Kf values ranging from 120.96 to 233.80 mmol1 nLn/kg, opposite behaviors for Pb2+\nadsorption were found in the presence of OTC, involving an increase of 28.1% at 0.10 mmol/L OTC and an decrease of 12.6% at 0.25 mmol/L OTC, respectively (Figs. 6B and 7B). Due to the special mechanism of lead immobilization by nHAP, the process was similar to co-precipitation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and metal ions with Fe in many environments [63]. Besides, the promotion or inhibition for lead immobilization really depends on the concentration of OTC. The addition of 0.10 mmol/L OTC could complex with Pb2+ to form PbOTC0 with higher affinity to nHAP, and the new precipitate might have larger surface area and newly formed binding sites due to OTC/Pb2+ loading, implying the promotion effect on removal of both Pb2+ and OTC. When OTC concentration reached to 0.25 mmol/L, „POPb2+ and „CaOPb2+ on the surface were probably saturated with regard to OTC loading, and an increasing amount of OTC might blockade the metal sites due to the formation of organic multilayers, which resulted in ending the reactions of (12) and (13) at the early stage [59,63,64]. Either way, the adsorption processes of both OTC and Cd2+ were always independent in binary systems, which suggested the neutral effect on adsorption isotherms between OTC and Cd2+ (Figs. 6C and 7C)."

      "heading" : "3.7. Adsorption mechanism",
      "text" : "XPS, FTIR and XRD analyses were performed to understand the interaction mechanism about adsorption of both OTC and metal ions onto nHAP. The results of XPS survey scans of seven samples are shown in Fig. 8A. Obviously, the major elements including Ca, P and O were found on the surfaces of these samples. The minor peaks of N 1s, Fe 2p, Cd 3d, Cu 2p and Pb 4f provided evidence of metal ion-OTC interactions on nHAP. More explanations are given below:\nThe Ca 2p XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 8B. Two peaks located at 350.68 and 347.11 eV were assigned to Ca 2p1/2 and Ca 2p3/2,\nrespectively [50]. The binding energy of Ca 2p3/2 in nHAP increased from 347.11 to 347.45 eV after OTC loading, which was attributed to the interaction between OTC and „CaOH. When OTC and metal ions coexisted in the aqueous solution, the binding energy of Ca 2p of these samples changed slightly as compared with nHAP-OTC, since OTC exhibited higher affinity toward Fe3+, Cu2+ and Pb2+, compared with Ca2+. The high resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p and Cu 2p are also shown in Fig. 8C and D. It was obvious that the XPS spectra of Fe 2p could be divided into six peaks, including Fe2+ 2p3/2 peak at 710.26 eV, Fe3+ 2p3/2 peak at 712.26 eV, Fe2+ 2p1/2 peak at 723.75 eV, Fe3+ 2p1/2 peak at 726.54 eV, and two satellite peaks at 716.29 and 719.71 eV, indicating that Fe existed as Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the samples and coordinated with nHAP to form FeAO bond. Besides, the peak of Fe3+ 2p3/2 shifted from 712.26 eV to 713.64 eV after OTC loading because of the interaction between Fe3+ and OTC [30]. In the Cu 2p spectra, two peaks located at 952.70 and 932.90 eV were assigned to the Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p2/3, respectively [65]. The peak of Cu 2p3/2 shifted from 932.90 to 933.31 eV after OTC loading. Moreover, a new minor peak of Cu 2p3/2 was observed at 934.81 eV, which might be attributed to the interaction of Cu2+ with the amino groups in OTC molecules to form stable complexes [33].\nAs for O 1s spectra in Fig. 9, three peaks located at 532.51, 531.18 and 530.59 eV were corresponded to 16.43% of chemisorbed H2O, 48.88% of hydroxyl groups on nHAP surface (e.g. „CaOH and „POH), and 34.69% of metallic oxide as well as phosphorus oxide (M-O), respectively. When OTC was absorbed on nHAP, the area ratio of hydroxyl groups reduced from 48.88% to 44.44% indicating that hydroxyl groups played an important role in OTC adsorption onto nHAP. Correspondingly, the increased ratio of M-O from 34.69% at 530.59 eV to 39.17% at 530.66 eV was assigned to the formation of CaAO between „CaOH and OTC (Fig. 9B). Besides, the area ratio of M-O dramatically increased from\n34.69% to 54.65%, 50.05%, and 49.63% after OTC/Fe3+, OTC/Cd2+, and OTC/Cu2+ loading, respectively, and the area ratio of hydroxyl groups also reduced proportionally (Fig. 9D-G). These changes might be ascribed to (1) the formation of „POMe(n 1)+ and „CaOMe(n 1)+ via the interaction shown in Eqs. (9)–(11) after metal ions loading; (2) the formation of ternary complexes, such as nHAP-Cu-OTC and nHAP-Pb-OTC, in which Cu2+ or Pb2+ could interact with O-containing groups in OTC molecules according to the proposed binding sites in Table 3.\nAccording to FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2B), the characteristic peaks of OTC were detected in HAP-OTC spectrum at the region of 1700– 1400 cm 1, such as 1651, 1610 and 1458 cm 1. It was likely that the peak belonged to C@O at C2 site in ring A shifted from 1669 to 1651 cm 1 due to hydrogen bonding of „POH and complexation with Ca2+ species [38]. The peak belonged to C@O at C11 site in ring C became blunter and slightly shifted from 1615 to 1610 cm 1 and the peak at 1582 cm 1 belonging to@NH at N4a site in ring A almost disappeared, which might be explained by complexation with Ca2+ ions on the surface of adsorbent. Compared with nHAP-OTC, the FT-IR spectra of nHAP-OTC/Cd2+ stayed the same after OTC/Cd2+ loading. While the peak located at\n1669 cm 1 sharply shifted to 1646 cm 1 in nHAP-OTC/Fe3+ spectra because of the strong complexation of Fe3+ with O3AO2a site in OTC molecules. Moreover, the peaks of C@O groups located at 1651 and 1610 cm 1 shifted to 1655 and 1600 cm 1 in nHAP-OTC/Cu2+ spectra, respectively, testifying the chelating path of Cu2HOTC3+ in Table 3. On the whole, the peak area of OAH between 3600 and 3400 cm 1 dramatically decreased after the reactions, which was consistent with XPS analysis. Besides, the C@C skeletal vibration at 1457 cm 1 was no lateral movement, but the peak area of this band decreased in these systems, possibly resulting from the reduction of carbon density after loading on nHAP.\nInterestingly, Additional peaks (21.6 and 30.2 ) were found and identified as Pb(10 x)Cax(PO4)6(OH)2 in the nHAP-OTC/Pb2+, but the XRD patterns of other samples kept unchanged in Fig. 2A, which indicated that the reaction between OTC/Pb2+ and nHAP was involved into mineral interior via a mechanism of dissolution and precipitation. Although a part of nHAP could react with OTC/Pb2+ to produce HP-OTC deposits according to reactions of (12) and (13), nHAP-Pb-OTC might also form on the surface of nHAP via an ion bridge effect. Specifically, the peak located at 1610 cm 1 shifted to 1598 cm 1 in nHAP-OTC/Pb2+ spectra due to the complexation\nof Pb2+ with C@O at C11 in OTC molecules (Fig. 2B), which could verify the possibility of OTC adsorption on nHAP-Pb. Therefore, the interaction among OTC, Pb2+ and nHAP was co-determined by dissolution-precipitation mechanism and bridging effects."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In summary, the interaction of OTC onto nHAP was influenced by OTC species under pH-regulation, complexing affinity of metal ions, and the process of co-precipitation in lead immobilization. The results implied that adsorptions of OTC were fitted by Elovich and Freundlich models, and adsorptions of heavy metals were described by Langmuir model. Anion species exhibited strong adsorption affinity at pH = 8.0 and high contribution to the overall adsorption of OTC. Besides, the presence of metal ions enhanced OTC adsorption via an ion bridge effect. When OTC and Cu2+ coexisted in the solution, the adsorption of both OTC and Cu2+ on nHAP were improved due to the stronger affinity of OTC-Cu2+ complexes compared with sole OTC or Cu2+. Meanwhile the interactions between Cd2+ and OTC were too feebler to exhibit significant changes in binary system resulting in the independent sorption of both OTC and Cd2+. However, the adsorption of OTC and Pb2+ onto nHAP was different from other systems since the interaction among OTC, Pb2+ and nHAP was co-determined by dissolution-precipitation mechanism and bridging effects. These findings not only help us understand how pH and metal ions influence OTC migration and transformation in the environment, but also prove the potential application of nHAP to remediate the cocontamination of them in environment."
