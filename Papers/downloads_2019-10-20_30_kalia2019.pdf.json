      "text" : "Nanotechnology (NT), the science of dwarf, involves the study of nanoscale (1–100 nm) materials (Feynman, 1991) that exhibit unique physical, chemical, and biological properties (Li et  al., 2001). It is a transgressing and multidisciplinary field that aims for innovative novel products and protocols which are anticipated to possess high-growth and pertinent broad impacts (Mishra et al., 2016). The nano-beverage utopia may involve supplementation of direct products of NT, nanomaterials (NMs) or ameliorating the tools and techniques of NT for generating novel textures or flavor concealers/enhancers from the components of the beverage itself. The NMs can be classified on the basis of their origin into two broad groups: natural and engineered. However, these can be better classified on the basis of their structural/ dimensional characteristics as 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D NMs. Further, the NMs can also be categorized on basis of their chemistry such as element/elemental forms [metal/nonmetal (M/NM), M/NM oxide/ nitride/sulfide], carbon NMs (Carbon Quantum dots, C60 fullerenes, carbon nanotubes SW-, DW-, and MW-CNTs), organic (synthetic/ natural) polymeric NMs (liposomes, micelles, dendrimers, solid lipid NPs, protein nanoparticles, and PLGA/PLA NPs) and composites ( organic–inorganic conjugate NMs) (Kumar and Kumbhat, 2016).\n164 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\nAs NMs exhibit unique properties compared to their bulk counterparts, their characterization is a prerequisite. Two basic characterization tools can be used to decipher different properties of NMs (Kumar and Kumbhat, 2016) (Fig.  7.1). Advanced microscopy tools can be helpful in elucidating the morphology (shape, size, size distribution profile, average particle diameter, and agglomerate types) and surface topography (surface facets, contours, edges, and lattices) of the NMs. These fundamentally include the electron microscopy (scanning and transmission EM and their variants) and scanning probe microscopy (atomic force microscopy) techniques. The spectroscopy tools involve interaction of light with matter can give information on the size/size distribution profile of the NMs (dynamic light scattering spectroscopy), zeta potential (surface charge potential that governs the physical stability and redispersibility of the nano-dispersion), crystallite behavior (X-ray diffraction spectroscopy), chemical functional groups (FT-Infra red/Raman spectroscopy), qualitative and quantitative surface chemical composition (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy), total elemental composition (Atomic absorption Spectroscopy or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry), and analytical electron diffraction techniques to elucidate polycrystallinity (small area electron diffraction, convergent beam electron diffraction, and dark field-TEM/HAADF-STEM) (Thomas et al., 2017).\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• •\nAllow control of environment and product packaging\nFor storage or transmission of data\nSensors\nBar labels\nBiosensor Nanosensor\nTime and temperature indicators Integrity indicators Freshness indicators\nIndicators of incidence\nRadiofrequency Identification (RFIDs)\nCommunication\nConvenience\nSensors/ Indicators\nSupporting data systems\nIntelligent/ Smart Beverage packaging\nsystems (IBPS or SBPS)\nFig. 7.1 Realization of smart beverage packaging systems: Platforms for simultaneous detection, presentation, and communication with the end-users about the product history, quality, and environment.\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 165"

      "text" : "Beverages are one of the most vulnerable commodities whose quality (organo-leptic or sensory and microbiological and chemical) and shelf life is drastically retained/enhanced/altered or deteriorated by the type of packaging or the packaging material used. The quintessential beverage packaging system must provide physical protection from shocks or vibrations to overt any mechanical damage, should safeguard package product from attack of different biotic agencies, and should ensure chemical stability owing to minimization of any changes in the chemical composition due to diverse abiotic factors, viz., moisture, light, or gases (Ramos et  al., 2015). Therefore, innovative packaging solutions are ardently required for maintenance of optimum quality standards for the packaged beverages and other drinks.\nThe potential applications of nano-enabled processes and products have been best identified and realized in food industry in virtually every segment of the sector (food processing, packaging, and nutrient supplements) (Duncan, 2011). However, urbanization has led to proliferative growth in the food packaging industry. This industry caters to the packaging needs of diverse subsidiary industries such as the fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, ready-to-eat meals, instant food, precooked foods, non-carbonated fruit-based beverages and other enterprises concerned with improving the preservation of food with prolonged shelf life (Kalia and Gupta, 2017; Kalia and Gupta, 2012; Kalia and Parshad, 2015). It is being refurbished through nanointerventions such that wastage of food besides waste generated due to improper disposal of the packaging material can be prudently dealt with. The NT-enabled solutions include engineered NM amendments to improve the material (gas exchange, photo-optic, mechanical) properties as well as to fabricate active packaging solutions or both at the same time (Radusin et al., 2016). These predicted trends have been translated as popular commercial food packaging products flaunting the willingness of the consumers for “out-of-food” nano-products (Unalan et al., 2014).\nThe food packaging products are predominated by use of petroleum-based nonbiodegradable materials or plastics as basic material (Othman, 2014). However, since inception the beverage industry chiefly utilized glass probably due to its unique practical properties such as being transparent, provides high gas barrier properties, and possesses appreciable nonreactive nature so that the ingredients remain chemically safe and being cost effective. Soon the beverage packaging industry started searching for non-glass alternatives that can help resolve the disadvantages of bulky and breakage-prone glass-based packaging system. The common polyethylene (PE low/high density)\n166 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\nderived packaging systems with variants such as flexible packaging modules; standing pouch packs initiated for Capri Sun orange drink (Wild, Germany) that later diversified to foil laminated pouches (Tetra Pak), and different size and shaped pouches (Cyclero, Finland; Peel Plastics Products, Canada and Ampac Flexibles, USA) (Farmer, 2013) are available now.\nThe plastic packaging systems exhibit use of low-cost materials and possess several desirable articulative functional advantages such as transparent, opalescent to translucent optical properties, ease of modulation to variety of shapes and sizes, amenability to many fabrication techniques (such as extrusion/coextrusion and lamination), and thermosealability (Ramos et al., 2015). However, soon the problems related to petro-plastics started cropping up. The plastic bottles/ containers had variable gas barrier properties, mostly transparent, these allowed light to interact with the packaged beverage, were prone to discoloration as reacted with the components of the juice/other products leading to development of off-flavors and deterred organoleptic characteristics of beverage probably due to maillard reaction (Wibowo et  al., 2015). The modified PE, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been used to package beverages and other drinks. This polymer exhibits comparable gas barrier properties to that of glass, possesses UV-resistance, good mechanical strength, can be molded or extruded, and is also amenable to supplementation of diverse nonplastic materials such as metal/non-metal/metal oxides. This fueled the endeavors to look out for innovative solutions. Moreover, due to globalization, longer supply chain containment for a batch consignment required improved shelf life, better gas barrier properties (oxygen, CO2, moisture) to curb or avoid undesirable changes in useful compounds, and other modulations such as spouts, tear strips, etc. have been steering toward revolution in beverage packaging systems (Ramos et  al., 2015). It is also amenable to innovative supplementations or additions such as flavor/gas releasing widget packaging systems like the one marketed by Guinness Ltd. and Ball Packaging Europe. The flavor-releasing packaging modules enhance, create, or maintain the product sensory properties, that is, quality and intensity of the beverage products by releasing flavors and aromas into beverage products at the point of consumption from the packaging polymer. AddMaster Pvt. Ltd. has developed a PE-based chocolate fragrance release packaging for chocolate-flavored milk-based drinks (Markarian, 2006). Similarly, ScentSational Technologies (Jenkintown, PA) have developed injection-molded closures for bottled water. These innovative solutions may involve NP supplementation of the polymer to fabricate polymer-NP hybrids that alters several properties of the new product, thus these materials as fillers can be of significance (Kalia and Parshad, 2015; Kaur et al., 2016). Addition of these fillers lead to\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 167\nalteration in the optical, mechanical, and other properties such that overall performance of the new product become at par or even superior to glass. Beverages account for a meager 19% of the total global advanced packaging scenario (Ramos et  al., 2015). Thus, there is a greater scope for expansion in this domain of food packaging."

      "text" : "Nanocomposite materials include any member(s) of the dimensionality classified NM category and amorphous materials supplemented in main matrix material such that it can be described as made of distinctly dissimilar components that are mixed at the nanometer scale (Camargo et al., 2009; Azeredo et al., 2011). Compared to the conventional packaging materials, nanocomposites have several additional benefits like enhanced strength or elasticity, improved biodegradability, antimicrobial action, and better control over gaseous molecules. The nanocomposite material is comprised of three different types of components, viz., the matrix material, filler, and the filler interface material with at least one of them in nanoscale order (Azeredo et al., 2011).\nThere are basically two types of polymers that could be used as composite matrix material, viz., the petrochemical-based polymers (like polyamides, nylons, polyolefins, polystyrene, ethylenevinylacetate copolymer, epoxy resins, polyurethane, polyimides, and polyethylene terephthalate) and the biopolymers (polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and their composites). A comprehensive overview of the various nanopackaging materials, that is, edible films, nanocomposite, bionanocomposite, and biodegradable nanocomposite films has been provided by Miller and Senjen (2008). Among the above-discussed biopolymer matrix materials, polylactic acid (PLA) (Tingaut et al., 2011) has the highest potential for commercialization followed by cellulose and polyhydroxy butyric acid because of the ease of production/availability and scaling up for commercial production (Janjarasskul and Krochta, 2010). The fruit and vegetable purees are the other major components that could be used to fabricate durable and cost- effective bionanocomposites (Azeredo et al., 2011). The bioplastics have been dealt in detail in Section 2.1.1.4. The nanoparticles as filler material to enhance the food packaging polymer properties have been actively researched in leading companies, including Bayer, Kraft, and Kodak (Farmer, 2013)."

      "heading" : "Nano-Fillers: Nanomaterials as Polymer Additives",
      "text" : "The particulate or the filler component that is to be added to the matrix to enhance its barrier properties, usually are nano-sized particles with high aspect ratio and are as diverse in nature and\n168 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\ncharacteristics as the matrix material itself. These may be of different types ranging from inorganic nanoparticles of clay such as montmorillonite or kalonite clay particles (Mangiacapra et al., 2006), carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles of noble metals like silver-, gold-, nano-zinc oxide, nano-SiO2 to organic such as nanocellulose fibers (Sozer and Kokini, 2009), cellulose nanocrystals (Habibi et al., 2008), starch, and chitin/chitosan (Chang et al., 2010). The nano-fillers may also impart the antimicrobial properties to the packaging material to check the growth of undesirable or contaminating microorganisms and for enhancing its shelf life.\nElemental/Element Oxide Nanoparticulate Additives These nanoparticulate fillers include a diverse range of particles of varied morphology and chemical nature. Usually, these fillers impart the potential antimicrobial properties to the composite. However, the nonmetal NMs can exhibit gas barrier properties as these may possess the moisture-binding/oxygen/CO2 scavenging activities. The following sections provide a detail account of these NMs.\nMetal/Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Metal nanoparticles are the crystalline 0D NMs having all dimensions in range of 1–100 nm that exhibit unique properties and unusual transport mechanisms. The nanoparticles of noble metals, gold (Au), and silver (Ag) possess potent antimicrobial properties owing to their strong UV-enabled photocatalytic oxidation stress mechanism (Dakal et  al., 2016; Wang et  al., 2017). The nanoscale oxides of the outer transition d-block metals including the zinc, copper, iron, titanium, platinum, and manganese further have high antimicrobial properties. These metal/metal oxide NPs have been amended in the polymeric matrices to enhance the gas barrier properties, mechanical strength, protection from photodegradation of polymer, and impart the antibacterial or antimycotic activity to curb unintentional or postharvest pathogenic contamination of fruits juices or beverages (Carbone et al., 2015; Ramos et al., 2015). Nowadays, there is an escalating trend for application of dual or multiple heavy metal/metal oxide NPs in the blended nanocomposites to enhance the antimicrobial action spectrum on pasteurization-hardy pathogens Lactobacillus plantarum in orange juice (Emamifar et al., 2011), Escherichi coli in fresh orange juice (Metak, 2015), and yeast and molds in kiwi and melon fruit juices (Lloret et al., 2012).\nNonmetal Oxide Nanoparticles The nonmetal oxide NPs primarily used as polymer fillers include silicate/aluminosilicate particles have morphological diversity ranging from spherical, quasi- spherical, layered lattices or exfoliated sheets. The nanoclay incorporated nanocomposites are now being popular due to better control over gaseous exchange which is a prerequisite for maintaining the quality of the fresh produce. These nanocomposites could be synthesized by methods like exfoliation/adsorption and in situ intercalative polymerization which\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 169\nenhance the tortuosity of the path gas molecules have to follow to reach and react with the produce surface components (Gacitua et al., 2005; Rashidi and Khosravi-Darani, 2011). The advantage of incorporation of nanoclay particles in the PET or other polymeric matrices can revolutionize the traditional green or brown colored glass packaging of beer and other effervescent carbonated drinks (Roohinejad and Greiner, 2017). Nanoclay has been the filler material used by Voridian using Imperm nanocomposite barrier technology and developed in association with Nanocor (USA). Miller Brewing Company has been utilizing the nanoclay particle technology currently to fabricate mechanically stronger plastic beer bottles having improved gas barrier properties to contain the CO2 molecules in the beer (Momin and Joshi, 2015). Another high oxygen barrier and recyclable nanoclay-based commercial plastic packaging product for beer involves the incorporation of polydiene-polyamide nanocomposite has been developed as Aegis OXCE grade (South Korean, Hite Brewery Hite Pitcher beer bottle). This nanocomposite can also be used for preparing flexible, lightweight, and cost-effective packaging products (Momin and Joshi, 2015)."

This group of NMs are most unique owing to their exceptional conductivity (thermal/electrical), and mechanical (high aspect ratio and greater elastic modulus) properties. These have been supplemented in polymers, particularly PET to derive diverse structural and functional materials (Wang et  al., 2015a, b). Chemically, polymer-CNM composites possess short polymer chain due to curbed extensions and enhanced crystallizability on CNT supplementation which leads to altered electric conductivity, enhanced mechanical strength, and elasticity of polymer-composite material (Agabekov et al., 2012; Dasan, 2015). Furthermore, a concentration dependent drastic enhancement in these special properties occur which\n170 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\nis influenced by the purity, aspect ratio, dispersion, and alignment of the CNMs particularly CNTs/CNFs (Yang et  al., 2005; Bauhofer and Kovacs, 2009). The 2D graphene materials exhibit mechanical properties similar to CNTs though the electrical and thermal properties are rather increased due to the larger surface of grapheme crystal lattices (Wang et al., 2015a, b)."

      "heading" : "Bioplastics",
      "text" : "To remain abreast for the surging demand for sustainability and environmental safety, R&D efforts have been directed toward development of biodegradable food packaging materials that could be completely mineralized and can be rapidly degraded (Jayaramudu et  al., 2013) besides steering researchers to develop alternative nanocomposite-based biodegradable packaging solutions (Kaur et  al., 2016). Degradable polymers such as biopolymers have been one of the favorable alternatives to be exploited and developed into eco-friendly food packaging materials due to their cost- effectiveness, amenability to existing mass scale-up fabrication technologies, environmental safety, and biodegradability (Tang et al., 2012). Unlike petroplastics, bioplastics are derived from renewable biomass source as diverse as plant starch (corn, potato, cassava, rice, wheat, barley, oat), natural fibers (jute, hemp, coconut, kenaf, bamboo, agri-waste such as straw, peel, hull, stem powder), vegetable oil (polyamides such as Rilson B PA11), and microbial processed glucose/starch derived polyester granules (polyhydroxy alkanoate and polyhydroxybutyrate) (Song et al., 2011). These consist of monomeric units covalently bonded, forming chain like molecules though the bonds remain vulnerable to degradation so that these get mineralized to organic by-product as CO2 and H2O (Othman, 2014). Bioplastics exhibit several characteristics superior to petroplastics including improved durability, flexibility, high gloss, clarity, and tensile strength. On basis of the chemistry of the biopolymers, these can be classified as synthetic such as PLA, polycaprolactone (PCL), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polybutylene succinate (PBS) (Rhim et al., 2013) or natural polymers derived from carbohydrates (starch, cellulose, chitosan, and agar)/proteins (gelatin, gluten, alginate, whey protein, and collagen) (Unalan et al., 2014). The bioplastics are finding enormous applications in packaging of milk and milk-based drinks (Huang et  al., 2014). The absolute degradability, stability at cold and ambient to microwave heating conditions of starch-derived bioplastics can be further harnessed to pack other types of beverages such as fruit juices and energy drinks. NatureWorks along with US agri-business “Cargill,” a US enterprise is a bioplastics giant manufacturing PLA containers and bottles for packaging of beverages and drinks (Farmer, 2013).\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 171\nBioelastomers, another category of biomass-derived plastics can be fabricated by adding starch or vegetable waste in silicon-based thermosets (in 80:20 ratio proportion) at ambient temperatures without investment of higher energy costs (Song et al., 2011). These elastomers have been developed to combat practical challenges of less durable mechanical strength and low water resistance of the biodegradable starch or vegetable waste powder-based biopolymers/−composites.\nBionanocomposites The bionanocomposites (BNCs), natural polymers/biopolymers, organic/inorganic filler (less than 5% by weight) and interfacial materials combinations exhibit elaborated benefits of biocompatibility and biodegradability which landmark their extensive applications in non-carbonated beverage packaging besides fresh-cut fruit and vegetable industry. The biopolymers that could be used as matrices for designing nanocomposites generally include polysaccharides such as cellulose and cellulose derivatives, starch and starch derivatives, pectin, chitosan, alginate, carrageenan, and different types of natural gums, viz., xanthan, guar and gum Arabic; organic acids like poly lactic acid, polyhydroxy butyric acid; proteins like zein, gluten, soy protein, peanut protein; and cotton-seed protein (plant origin), casein and whey protein (animal origin); and lipids particularly a variety of waxes and fatty acids (Azeredo et al., 2011)."

These IBPS can be dichotomized as data support systems (DSS) to trace the packaging history of beverages (RFIDs or bar labels) and indicators/sensors which can detect the occurrence of contaminants (low molecular weight species) and adulterants, allergens, and food-borne pathogens in complex food matrices (Fig. 7.1). The sensors will be dealt in detail in Section 2.3.

      "heading" : "7.1.2.1 Nano-Nutrient Fortification",
      "text" : "Macro and micronutrients are the essential elements which are required in substantial to trace quantities for optimum working of several metabolic processes in living organisms including humans. The initial nano-nutrient supplementation appeared in the dairy industry targeting the elderly people through a milk-based beverage product launched by FrieslandCampina that claimed faster calcium digestion (Santillán-Urquiza et  al., 2017). Moreover, the most common functional drink, milk has itself been an oil in water emulsion. Recent years have witnessed increased impetus for utilization of the same principle to develop nanoemulsions of essential minerals such as macroelement calcium and micronutrients like iron, zinc, and selenium; vitamins, and other functional ingredients that can be supplemented in whole milk or its varied products. Very low level of Ca-bioavailability in the commercial products fortified with bulk-Ca has invoked the interest for nano-Ca supplementations. The larger surface area to volume ratios of the nano-Ca particles can ensure enhanced bioavailability which was experimentally substantiated by Park et al. (2008) in their in vivo studies on feeding ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic rats with nano-Ca supplemented milk whereby nano-Ca subjects exhibited greater reformation of the trabecular bone compared to bulk-Ca milk test animals. Likewise, Erfanian et al. (2014) have also linked increased\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 175\nCa-bioavailability with decreasing size. Another macronutrient, magnesium fortified milk drink with trade name Candia Viva has also been commercially available in European market (Shukla et al., 2017).\nAmong the trace elements, bioavailability of iron in Fe-fortified milk can be enhanced drastically by decreasing size as has been documented by Pereira et al. (2014) for particulate size of 5 to 10 nm in in  vitro studies. The nano-iron fortifications become more crucial as fast Fe-releasing iron salts such as ferrous sulfate or citrate can severely affect natural gut microflora causing gut-related problems besides high blood Fe-levels may lead to an array of cardiovascular, kidney disorders, and diabetes (Shukla et  al., 2017). The problem further gets compounded up by the poor disposal of iron from the body such that long-term consumption of Fe-supplements can lead to damage to the cell and its components possibly due to increased oxidative stress particularly lipid peroxidation or even development of cancer. Thus, development of novel Fe-supplementation products (via Fe-encapsulation in solid lipid NPs and Vitamin C capped magnetite NPs) and techniques can improve Fe-bioavailability in the body to treat Fe-deficiency rapidly in a short span (Shukla et al., 2017).\nSelenium is another trace element possessing potential antioxidant/anticancerous properties. Milk contain quite low natural Se contents far below the RDI of 20–100 μg day−1 and hence, Se-fortifications are desirable (Kuriyan et al., 2016). However, Se-supplementation may lead to decrease in the availability or absorption of several other trace elements particularly zinc (González-Arrojo et  al., 2016). Therefore, probably nano-selenium could be a possible refuge to address such problems. Alzate et al. (2010) have observed that lactobacilli are able to biotransform even the toxic concentration of selenium salts in medium and convert as well as excrete soluble selenium to elemental selenium nanoparticles (approximate size ranges 100–500 nm) outside the cell. These transformations can be instrumental in providing a better Se-supplementation on consumption. Therefore, Se-supplemented milk-based drinks having fermentation products such as yogurt milk and buttermilk can be commercialized. Selenium nanoparticles have been incorporated in a yogurt formulation to develop LactoMicroSel product to enhance absorption and uptake of selenium on consumption (Eszenyi et al., 2011).\nMultiple mineral supplemented whole milk/milk beverages can only be generated by incorporation of nanoscale mineral elements or their salts as this will avoid the cross-talk among elements besides enhancing the stability and bioavailability of the component elements on consumption (Santillán-Urquiza et al., 2017).\nMineral supplementation of other beverages particularly functional drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks, fruit juices, mineral waters, and low alcoholic blended soft drinks has peaked during the\n176 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\nlast decade (Ashurst and Palmer, 2016). However, supplementation of fruit-based drinks with nanoscale nutrients such as nano-iron or nano-zinc (Miller and Senjen, 2008) is expected to enhance the health and sensorial benefits of the product. Such customized fruit drinks can assertively correct mineral deficiency disorders due to better dispersion, controlled release, improved bioavailability, and higher absorption of single, dual to multiple nutrients from a single drink (Miller and Senjen, 2008). Dachner et al. (2015) have analyzed the supplementation standards for micronutrient and vitamin contents of 46 different energy drinks, vitamin waters, and juice samples were collected from Canadian supermarkets in 2014 and compared with the 2004 results. The researchers have reported changing pattern in micronutrient composition that is, supplementation rates higher compared to the contents required as per the Dietary reference Intakes besides alteration in the on-package marketing over time."

The beverage texture is a crucial component affecting flavor release besides the availability of the loaded nutrient. It also substantially contributes to the overall eating experience. Innovative ingredients and solutions are emerging to help formulators to add flavors, colors, and healthy ingredients and keep up with consumer demands for innovative beverages.\nPowder drinks are innovative waterless drinks, may include the nano-spray dried or freeze-dried fruit juices or spray dried flavoring/clouding emulsions (Ashurst and Palmer, 2016). These drinks exhibit long-term stability besides being ideal for vitamin fortification due to the slow decay rate in the absence of water and without air ingress. Similarly, a change in the type of food colorants added to the beverages has swung from use of synthetic colorants to natural or bio- colorants (extracted from fruits, vegetables, seeds, roots,\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 177\nmicroorganisms) (Cardoso et al., 2017). This has probably enabled the supplementation of food colorants on “quantum satis” basis. The biocatalysts can be utilized to develop new textures, particularly laccase along with its Laccase Mediator System (LMS) which has been utilized to cross-link milk proteins with overall texture similar to stirred milk yogurt (Mokoonlall et al., 2016; Mate and Alcalde, 2017)."

      "heading" : "7.1.2.3 Beverage as Functional Food: The Nano-Trends",
      "text" : "Novel nano-inspired functional drinks can be derived from natural ingredients though may involve amalgamation/simultaneous incorporation of capsules or emulsions of both water- and fat-soluble vitamins, essential micronutrient elements, natural pigments in a protein/dietary fiber-based drink (Wang et al., 2016) (Fig. 7.1). Functional foods, bioactives, or other compound supplemented designer food products are anticipated to prevent dietary habit-related metabolic disorder such as cancer, coronary heart disorders, unhealthy gut disorders, and obesity (Kwak et al., 2014). As the nano-nutrient incorporations have been dealt in detail in Section 2.2.1, this section will only elaborate the non-nutrient fortifications.\nThe potential bioactive ingredients include vitamins (vitamin A, E, B, and C) (Dachner et al., 2015), beneficial unsaturated fatty acids (omega-3-polyunsaturated fats), dietary fibers, flavonoids and other polyphenols, antioxidants such as lycopene, β-carotene, herbal supplements (extracts of rhizomes, seeds like gensing) (Gopi et al., 2016; Singh, 2016; Saxena et al., 2017). The most common good ingredients supplemented in functional drinks are the fiber, calcium, iron and oligosaccharides that are marketed to impart beneficial effects on different organ systems in human body particularly the digestive system, bones, teeth, and other body parts, as appropriate (Ashurst and Palmer, 2016). The ACE drinks contain β-carotene, Vitamin C and E, and thus possesses antioxidant properties to protect elderly or immunocompromised individuals from a variety of cancer and cardiovascular disorders. While fiber drinks primarily containing dietary non-starch polysaccharide “fibers” keep the bowel healthy besides managing the cholesterol-related disorders (Ashurst and Palmer, 2016).\nSubstantially different processing and production techniques have to be followed for the development of functional food products partially due to higher sensitivity of the bioactive compounds to a myriad of environmental, processing, and transformation/absorption conditions on consumption besides the issues related to stability of the individual ingredients or the whole product (Wang et al., 2016). However, the most popular techniques for nano-sizing of the bioactive compounds are coacervation, extrusion, spray drying, and emulsification in ascending order of preference (Jana et  al., 2017). Nanoemulsions\n178 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\ncan invariably deliver lipid-soluble bioactive compounds as these enhance the surface area to volume ratios of the emulsion micelles thereby improving their dispersion in aqueous systems, and thus bioavailability (Ozturk et al., 2015).\nSeveral bioactive compounds exhibit poor water disponibility and hence lower availability and absorption due to their water-phobic characteristics in the digestive tract. These issues can be better addressed by nano-enabled encapsulation techniques. Diverse NMs can be utilized both as carriers/delivery vehicles for slow, continuous or controlled delivery of encapsulated compounds, and as protecting agents ensuring temperature and photo-protection of bioactive compounds. Nanoencapsulation of the natural phytochemical, naringenin, isolated from citrus peel enhanced its bioavailability and biodistribution on oral administration besides improving its controlled release over longer period (Yen et  al., 2009). Nanoencapsulation of the reactive anthocyanin pigments, rutin encapsulation in ferritin nanocages are the other practical examples of nano-interventions for development of novel functional beverages (Singh et al., 2017). Therefore, nanoencapsulation served two purposes, protection of the active component from UV or temperature extremes, and enhancement of its solubility compared to free compound (Yang et al., 2015).\nNanoceutical supplementation of beverages has the potential to revolutionize the availability of product brands and types in the food pharmaceutical industry owing to greater health benefits for instance elevated brain-related functions and general improvement in the gut physiology, product improvement or value addition in terms of sensorial benefit (better product textural values such as enhanced color, flavor, taste, and consistency due to reduced use of preservatives) and easy detectability (Erickson, 2009; Huang et  al., 2010; Srinivas et  al., 2010). Nanoceuticals, nanoencapsulated nutraceuticals like phytochemicals, flavanoids, Co-enzyme Q10 (Huang et al., 2009) have been supplemented in the fruit juices, fruit-based beverages or fortified nutritional drinks and dairy-based drinks (Anis et al., 2017). NutraLease and Aquanova (under NovaSol product umbrella) have launched several commercial products based on encapsulation of functional compounds in beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceutics to improve the bioavailability of diverse bioactive compounds (Jana et al., 2017). However, issues regarding the physical stability, sensory properties, and probable regulatory concerns have simultaneously cropped with development of nanoformulations of several of these bioactives (Singh, 2016).\nBioactives in milk and milk-based drinks include a variety of nutraceutical ingredients such as chitosan, isoflavone, mistletoe, conjugated linoleic acid, Inonotus obliquus, and peanut sprout extract (Kwak et al., 2014). The nano-sizing (in range of 400–600 nm) of these ingredients\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 179\nparticularly chitosan (incorporation rate 1%–3% v/v), gensing (2%–4% v/v), and peanut sprout (1%–3% v/v) can dramatically enhance their bioavailability and nutritional quality through improved biological activity. Moreover, the nano-chitosan can also serve as a delivery vehicle to load certain antagonistic or incompatible ingredients like Vitamin C in milk (at 1%–3% v/v concentrations) (Seo et al., 2011).\nNano-enabled products or processes can also be utilized to curb the absorption of harmful compounds in the GI tract. The incorporation of phytosterols (steroid alcohols of plant origin which can be esterified with vegetable oil fatty acids) in Shemen canola oil has reduced the cholesterol absorption by 14% in the intestine due to their ability to compete with cholesterol for gut sites which helps in reducing the related health hazards (Ashurst and Palmer, 2016; Jana et al., 2017)."

      "text" : "Nanobiocatalysts are comprised of biological catalysts or enzymes immobilized in/on NMs. As the nanoscale dimensions of the vehicle/ immobilization matrix, the NMs match up to the structural dimensions of the biological macromolecules (Starke, 2011), it is prudent to immobilize the enzyme proteins offering greater surface area for catalysis besides it protects the loaded enzyme from a variety of components or factors affecting the overall performance of the enzyme. NMs possess intermediate properties between atoms/or molecules and bulk materials due to a greater surface area-to-volume ratios and quantum confinement phenomena.\nMatter at nanoscale exhibits random brownian motion so that using NMs as support matrix can help in obviating the key problems that affect the biocatalyst efficiency due to increase in the specific surface area, curtailing of mass transfer resistance for substrate and/or product and considerable effective loading of the biocatalyst (Ahmad and Sardar, 2015). Nano-immobilized enzymes exhibit enhanced catalytic activity compared to unbound free enzyme due to occurrence of localized nano-environments besides offering better stability against proteolytic degradation and higher temperatures due to conformational changes during immobilization process (Misson et  al., 2015). The higher operational costs of enzyme catalyzed bioprocesses can be further curtailed by recovering the enzyme (Verma et al., 2013).\nFruit juices and other products can be clarified, and other valueadditions can be performed by use of these immobilized enzymes (Gassara-Chatti et al., 2013). A nano-chitosan immobilized protease exhibited higher stability to pH and temperature variations, better\n180 Chapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY\nstorage stability, and enhanced orange juice clarification rates as well as improved reusability compared with the soluble protease of P. vannamei (Shojaei et al., 2017). Similarly, Shahrestani et al. (2016) have reported enhanced catalytic activity of Fe3O4 at SiO2 NP immobilized xylanase at 60°C showing greater juice clarification potentials besides having improved stability and reusability characteristics. Another work accentuated the immobilization of β-galactosidase on ZnO NPs for enhancing its reusability for fermentation of lactose milk sugar to prepare whey at higher temperature (50°C) (Husain et al., 2011).\nThe nanobiocatalysts can be developed by nano-scaling achieved through fabrication of either nano-carrier-based and/or carrier-less cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) (Mission et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015a, b). A graphical detail for the different types of inorganic element derived nano-carriers for enzyme immobilization has been given in Fig. 7.2. Among the nano-carrier-based systems, gold NPs are most versatile nano-carriers for immobilization of proteins/enzymes due to their affinity for the thiol (–SH) in the sulfur containing amino acids and amino groups of the candidate proteins (Wang et al., 2015a, b). Moreover, the amenability of AuNPs for variety of functionalizations can further ensure tight chemisorption, and fixation of functional molecules in the desired geometry (Wang et al., 2015a, b). The other popular metal oxide NPs are the magnetic iron-derived NPs which offer unique superparamagnetism for easy separation and recovery of the nanobioconjugate under the influence of external magnetic fields (Talekar et al., 2017). Further, more than one enzyme can be loaded\nFig. 7.2 Nano-interventions for supplementation of bioactive compounds and phytonutrients in fruit juice and other beverages.\nChapter 7 NANO-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE INDUSTRY 181\non the same magnetic NP-biocatalyst assembly to complete a reaction cascade for multistep hydrolysis processes such as immobilization of triple enzymes, alpha amylase, glucoamylase, and pullulanase on FeO NPs to perform one pot hydrolysis of starch (Talekar et al., 2017). The nano-immobilization enhances the stability of the enzyme(s) as the FeO NP tri-enzyme nanobiocatalyst exhibited improved thermal and higher tolerance to alkaline pH besides achieving 100% conversion rate.\nAmong the nonmetal oxides, mesoporous silica NPs require special mention as these NPs are hierarchically organized, exhibit uniform nano-porosity attributes and thus provide greater total surface area over the crystalline metal/metal oxide NPs (DiCosimo et  al., 2013). The nano-hybrid strategies are rather recent which ensure less leakage of the immobilized enzyme (Jampala et  al., 2017). The nano-hybrids of biocatalysts can be generated by complexation with natural polysaccharide such as levan followed by encapsulation in sodium alginate (Jampala et  al., 2017). Enzyme immobilization on 2D carbon nanomaterial “Graphene” exhibit notable benefits as it presents sovereign methods to couple biocatalysts besides having ability to affect the catalytic behavior due to variation in the microenvironment of biomolecules (Pavlidis et al., 2014)."

This will cater twofold advantages, it will properly address the supplementary renewable fuel or energy issues, and also will provide eco-prudent waste disposal. Considering the need for novel technological alternatives to address the lacunae of protocols and techniques of second-generation biofuel generation from agri-waste, NT could offer feasible solutions (Ahmad and Sardar, 2015). The major challenge of this system is release of sufficient fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic material by use of two common catalysts, cellulose, and homogenous acids. These conventional catalysts exhibit low efficiency, have high cost, require long reaction time, are corrosive, and possess serious disposal/treatment issues besides poor recyclability (Rai et  al., 2016). The use of nano-enabled interventions, primarily immobilization of the enzymes involved in conversion of agri-waste to biofuel on nanomaterials as adsorbent matrices can enhance the biocatalyst efficiency (Rai et al., 2016; Verma et al., 2016). Moreover, NMs particularly, nanoparticles of titanium dioxide, functionalized silica, magnetic acids, hydrotalcite, and carbonaceous acids can improve the efficiency of the solid acid catalysts required for lingo-cellulose degradation, one of the promising alternatives to conventional catalysis (Rai et al., 2016) (Fig. 7.3).\n182 C h ap ter 7 N AN O-REVOLUTION IN BEVERAGE IN DUSTRY\nFig. 7.3 Nano-carriers as immobilization matrices to enhance stability, reusability and bioconversion rate of commercial enzymes/proteins involved in processing of juices and other beverages.

The sensor is comprised of three components: sensing element to selectively detect target in matrix, transducer to convert sensing element-target interaction to some measurable signal, and read-out component to display digitally the quantity of the sensed target. The use of NMs for fabrication of any of the components of the sensor transforms it as nanosensor (Warrinera et al., 2014). The most common, low-cost and robust nanosensor assays exhibiting ease of observation involves visual color changes in metal/metal oxide/semiconductor (Ag/Au/Fe3O4/CdSe/CdTe/ZnS) NP sols in the presence of analyte(s), that is, contain optical transducer systems (Ramos et  al., 2015). Several variants of these optical nanosensors such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence, fiber optic, and PEBBLE are available now.
