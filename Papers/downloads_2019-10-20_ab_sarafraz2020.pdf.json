The potential role of operating parameters including heat flux perpendicular to the surface (HF), concentration of the nanoparticle (NP), strength of magnetic field (MF), zeta potential and concentration of a specific surfactant on HTC, critical heat flux (CHF) and transient fouling resistance of the surface was identified. Results showed that MF can lower the fouling resistance providing that the nanosuspension is stable. It was shown that in this case, the HTC value was also promoted. However, the enhancement of HTC strongly depended on the zeta potential value. Likewise, by increasing the NP concentration, the CHF value was augmented, while the HTC was promoted u to wt. % ¼ 0.15 and then decreased at wt. % ¼ 0.2. This behavior was attributed to the existence of a thermal resistance on the surface. Notably, the bubble formation on the surface was intensified due to the MF, which was attributed to the formation of irregularities and micro-cavities due to the deposition of the NPs."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Boiling is one of the most efficient mechanism of heat transfer for cooling and heating applications at high heat flux conditions. This plausible feature is attributed to the formation of the bubbles which creates a two-phase heat transfer mechanism. The presence of the bubbles can renew the thermal and fluid boundary layer, which in turn promotes the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of the system. There are extensive studies in the literature towards the lack of understanding of the governing mechanisms and exact behavior of fluids in a two-phase boiling regime. Nano-suspensions are the promising working fluids for the future of the advanced thermal engineering and have been assessed for various applications. When the boiling heat transfer comes to the nano-suspensions, understanding the mechanism of heat transfer becomes challenging as bubble-bubble, bubble-surface and bubble-liquid interactions affect the heat transfer rate. Moreover, deposition of the nanoparticle (NP) is another challenge affecting the properties of the surface, which in turn can suppress or promote the performance of the system. It is worth saying that, in boiling of nano-suspensions, the stability of the nano-suspension can be altered due to the evaporation of the base fluid, which can intensify the rate of deposition and surface change.\nThus, boiling heat transfer of nano-suspensions requires further investigation.\nCritical Heat Flux referred to as CHF point is a heat flux (HF), in which the HTC of the system is maximum and thereby, the rate of bubble formation is superior such that the bubbles surround the boiling surface. By increasing the population density of the bubbles over the surface, bubble coalescence occurs, which in turn creates a large-size bubbles and blanket of vapor on the surface. Such large blankets can insulate the surface and reduce the heat transfer. Overall, the HTC value decreases and performance of the system is suppressed. This can lead to the system failure. There are extensive studies conducted on heat transfer mechanisms involved in boiling heat transfer. Hence, the studies can be categorized into three different groups. The first group of study shows that the boiling heat transfer is suppressed once NPs are added to the system, while there is a second group demonstrating that the boiling heat transfer can be promoted due to the presence of the NPs. These two groups of study have one point in common that the deposition of the NPs on the surface can improve the CHF value. Therefore, a vision was created to use passive and active methods with the aim to prevent or regulate the deposition of the NPs such that the HTC remains untouched or be promoted. The utilization of magnetic field (MF) is one plausible\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: mohammadmohsen.sarafraz@adelaide.edu.au (M.M.

For example, Verplaetsen and Berghmans [1], conducted a set of experiments to evaluate the potential role of MF on the HTC value of a magnetic nano-suspension in a film boiling regime. They showed that the formation of the bubbles can be affected by the direction and strength of the MF. Arias [2] showed that MF can improve the HTC in liquid metals. He demonstrated that the frequency of the bubble separation decreases by increasing the strength of the MF. Fan et al. [3] evaluated the heat transfer characteristics of aqueous graphene oxide nano-sheets nano-suspensions at wt.% ¼ 0.1% to cool down some metallic balls. They reported that the performance of the system was enhanced once nano-suspension was used in the system and the quenching mechanism was boiling heat transfer. By conducting a series of experiments, Aminfar et al. [4] demonstrated the potential of combination of MF and nano-suspension to improve the CHF in flow boiling regime. Results showed that the CHF value can be promoted once a MF is applied to a magnetic nano-suspension. They attributed the enhancement of CHF value to the change in surface properties and deposition of the NPs. Abdollahi et al. [5] conducted some experiments to further evaluate the effect of MF on the HTC value in pool boiling of iron based nano-suspensions. They experimentally proved that the MF can promote the HTC by affecting the surface deposition, however, they did not report any information on the potential thermal resistance over the surface.\nIn light of above, despite extensive research conducted on the influence of the MF on the boiling performance of the nano-suspensions, the influence of zeta potential as one of the key characteristics of the nano-suspension together with MF on the value of the CHF, the boiling heat transfer and fouling thermal resistance (FTR) has not been fully studied. In the previous studies reported in the literature, the dependence of the deposition rate of NPs with zeta potential and its influence on CHF has not been studied. Hence, there is a need to further investigate the effect of ferro-fluid deposition layer on the CHF, HTC and thermal fouling resistance values of the nano-suspension with the consideration of a MF and zeta potential. Zeta potential not only influences the rate of the deposition of the NPs on the surface, but also changes the stability behavior and thermal conductivity of the nanosuspension. Thus, in this work, experimental study on the thermal performance of Fe3O4/water nano-suspension stabilized with nonylphenol ethoxilates is carried out. Characteristic tests are performed to analyze the quality of the prepared nano-suspensions. The influences of various operating parameters including the concentration of NPs, HF and zeta potential and surfactant concentration on the HTC, CHF and FTR are experimentally measured and discussed. In addition, a visualization study on the bubble formation of NPs on boiling surface covered by NPs under the influence of MF is conducted to understand the role of MF on fouling formation of iron oxide particles. Also, the wettability of the surface was also investigated using contact angle measurement. The findings presented here will develop a new insight on the potential influence of the MF and zeta potential on the enhancement of boiling heat transfer and CHF for a ferro-fluid and correlates the influence of zeta potential on the value of the CHF, HTC together with the boiling surface characteristics."

The heat flux generator is a cylinder made from copper (k ¼ 440 W/(mK)). It is dual diameter cylinder with diameters of 20 and 10 mm at bottom and upper regions, respectively. A 650 Watt cartridge heater is perforated and placed inside the center of the rod, connected to an autotransformer. The top side of the heater is mounted inside the container. The body of the heater and the container was insulated with a PTFE material to minimize the heat loss. To capture the bubble interaction and bubble generation, a high-speed camera manufactured by Casio (model EX-F1) was installed in front of the sight glass of the container. To quantify the temperature along with the length of the rod, 5 k-type thermocouples were installed inside the thermo-wells filled with silicone to de-aerate the thermo-wells and to omit the thermal resistance. A linear extrapolation was employed to obtain the surface boiling temperature. The detailed specifications have been provided in Fig. 3. It is worth saying that to measure the bulk temperature, a distribution of temperature was measured with three thermometers (RTDs) connected to a data logger. A water-cooled condenser was used to liquefy any evaporations from the test rig.\nFour magnets were used to produce a uniform MF around the test rig and the magnitude of the MF was measured with a Lutron EMF-827 instrument with response time of 0.4 s and accuracy of 0.32 mT."

      "text" : "In Fig. 8, the variation of HTC with applied HF is depicted for different mass fractions of nano-suspensions in the absence of MF. As shown, by increasing the HF, the boiling HTC increases, however, the increase for the HTC at low HF zone is lower than that of quantified for the high HF zone, which is attributed to the formation of bubbles at HF zone. In low HF region, the mechanism of heat transfer is “natural convection”, while in high HF region, the mechanism shifts towards the nucleate boiling. In this region, bubbles formation, bubble sliding and local agitation due to the bubble interaction can intensify the HTC value. Importantly, by increasing the concentration of nano-suspensions, the HTC increases. For example, at wt. % ¼ 0.05, the maximum boiling HTC enhancement was 16%, while for wt. % ¼ 0.1, wt. % ¼ 0.15, the maximum enhancement was 23%, 34%, respectively. Noticeably, there is a point for the concentration of NPs (here is wt. % ¼ 0.2) at which a fouling layer imposes a significant thermal resistance around the heating section. Moreover, due to the creation of a uniform fouling layer of the NPs at wt. % ¼ 0.2, the rate of the bubble formation decreases, which results in the decrease in the boiling HTC. In the vicinity of the CHF\nM.M. Sarafraz et al.\nInternational Journal of Thermal Sciences 147 (2020) 106131\npoint, by increasing the heat flux, due to the formation of a vapor blanket around the heating surface, the heat is accumulated on the surface, causing a decrease in the HTC. This behavior was seen for all the nano-suspensions. Notably, the mass concentration was found to increase the CHF point due to the formation of the nano-particles on the surface as shown in previous experiments. The HTC tends to sharply decrease as HF closes to the critical HF point. For the present research, we considered the sharp reduction in the HTC as the CHF point, which is in accordance with the literature [8–10]. Therefore, the points shown in Fig. 8 are identified as the occurrence of the CHF."

      "text" : "To investigate the potential influence of the MF, it is crucial to have a gradient of MF on the boiling heating surface. For this purpose, different magnets were used around the heating section. In addition, before running the experiments, at each stage, the strength and order of magnitude of the MF on the boiling section was measured using an MF meter to ensure that the effective MF is applied to the boiling surface. As mentioned, two different MFs with strength of 0.58 T and 1.0 T were applied to the system. Fig. 9 shows the schematic representation of the top view of the vessel between two parallel magnets and their MF applied to the vessel. The MF was simulated using MF simulator. As can be seen, the vessel is exposed to a uniform SS-NN MF from S to N poles of\nM.M. Sarafraz et al.\nInternational Journal of Thermal Sciences 147 (2020) 106131\nthe magnets located at right and left sides of the vessel. In Fig. 10, the variation of HTC with applied HF is depicted for different mass concentrations of the nano-suspension in the presence of the MF at zeta potential of 45 mV. The magnitude of the applied MF was 0.58 T. As can be seen, for zeta potential of 45 mV, when the MF is applied to the vessel, the boiling HTC increases regardless of the concentration of the NPs. The influence of the MF on the natural convection region is negligible in comparison with its effect in nucleate boiling domain. The main reason for the enhancement of the HTC is largely due to the regular migration of NPs with negative surface charge towards the pole of magnet with the opposite dominant charge. This migration may intensify the Brownian motion of the particles and the thermo-phoresis effect as well. In fact, the local agitation and the Brownian motion of the magnetic NPs can be affected by the MF providing that the nanosuspension is stable and has sufficient surface charge to be affected by the MF. Therefore, it can be stated that zeta potential is one of the key parameter in determining the role of MF on the HTC, which requires further investigation.\nFig. 11 comparatively presents the dependence of the CHF enhancement ratio and the HTC enhancement ratio on the mass concentration of nano-suspensions for the zeta potential set at 45 mV in the absence of the MF and for vol% ¼ 0.1 of NPE surfactant. As can be seen, by increasing the mass concentration of the nano-suspension, the HTC enhancement ratio increases up to wt. % ¼ 0.15 and then slightly decreases. The maximum enhancement for the HTC was 34% at wt. % ¼ 0.15. This is because at mass concentration of 0.2% and higher, a continual fouling layer forms on the heating surface, which covers the irregularities and micro-cavities of the surface. Then, the bubble formation suppresses and as a result, the nucleate boiling HTC is deteriorated. However, for CHF enhancement ratio, by increasing the mass concentration of nano-suspension, the CHF point increases up to 41% at wt.% ¼ 0.2. This is also because of the fouling formation of NPs on the surface, which creates a porous layer that enhances the wettability and capillary action of the surface discussed in section 3.6. Therefore, more liquid is absorbed by the layer through the capillary wick (porous layer) and surface remains wet at higher HFs. This is in accordance with the results published in previous works [8,9,11–14]."

      "text" : "Fig. 13 represents the variation of the CHF value with the concentration of the NPE surfactant for water and nano-suspension at wt. % ¼ 0.2. As can be seen, by increasing the volumetric concentration of the surfactant, the CHF semi-asymptotically decreases. For example, for water without NPE, the CHF is 1170 kW/m2, however, at vol. % ¼ 0.05 of NPE, the CHF reaches ~1080 kW/m2 and it is suppressed to ~1045 kW/m2 at vol. % ¼ 0.1 of NPE. Interestingly, for nanosuspension, the same trend was observed, however, for any given concentration values of the NPE surfactant, the CHF value was larger than water. For example, at vol. % ¼ 0.05 of NPE, the CHF for nano-\nM.M. Sarafraz et al.\nInternational Journal of Thermal Sciences 147 (2020) 106131\nsuspension is 1380 kW/m2, which is larger than that of observed for the nano-suspension at vol. % ¼ 0.1 of NPE (CHF ¼ 1347 kW/m2) and water. Notably, the experiments were limited to a narrow range of concentration of surfactant. This is because to keep the nano-suspension and zeta potential in the stable region and also to avoid the formation of foam layer on the boiling surface and within the bulk of the water due to the chemical effect on the surface tension of water. Also, a comparison was made between the CHF measured experimentally and those of estimated with Zuber [15] and Ded-Lienhard [16] correlations. A good agreement of less than 5% was observed between the correlations and the experimental data.\nIn Fig. 14, variation of HTC with HF is depicted for various vol% of the surfactant for water and nano-suspension at wt. % ¼ 0.15. As previously shown, the presence of the NP in water increases the pool boiling HTC, which was attributed to the increase in the thermal conductivity, Brownian motion and thermophoresis phenomena. However, by increasing the amount of the surfactant, the surface tension decreases resulting in an enhancement in boiling HTC. This is because, for larger concentrations of the surfactant, smaller bubbles can form within the\nliquid, which creates some bubble columns causing a local agitation on the surface, which not only increases the rate of the heat transfer from the hot surface to the bulk of the fluid, but also reintroduces the microlayer of the boiling with the fresh nano-suspension around the boiling micro-layer. However, the effect of the surfactant is again limited since it rigorously forms a layer of foam around the heating section and also within the bulk of the liquid. This not only decreases the conduction heat transfer in the fluid (due to the presence of the vapor within the foamy layer) but also suppresses the Brownian motion of the NPs and the local agitation of the fluid due to the bubble formation. Hence, by increasing the concentration of the surfactant, the HTC initially enhances slightly and remains constant for the other concentration of the surfactant. As can be seen, at HF of 720 kW/m2, the HTC for the nano-suspension without any surfactant, the nano-suspension with surfactant at vol. % ¼ 0.05 and the nano-suspension with surfactant at vol. % ¼ 0.1 is 31.3 kW/m2, ~33.1 kW/m2, and 33.2 kW/m2, respectively, which shows that the surfactant has a limited influence on the HTC. This findings are in conjunction with the previous works reported in the literature [17,18].\nM.M. Sarafraz et al.\nInternational Journal of Thermal Sciences 147 (2020) 106131"

      "heading" : "3.6. Zeta potential",
      "text" : "Zeta potential is the measure of the electrostatic, repulsive or attractive forces between the NPs, which shows that a nano-suspension is stable or has instable behavior [19]. The higher the repulsive forces between the particles, the longer stability can be seen in nano-suspension [19]. For better understanding, the zeta potential has been schematically represented in Fig. 15. As can be seen, in a proximity of the particle external surface, a layer is defined as Stern layer, in which the net charge of the layer is similar to the surface charge. However, the electrostatic charge carried by nano-suspension is determined by zeta potential concept. By increasing the distance from the particle surface, the potential zeta asymptotically decreases reaching to a constant value close to zero. Therefore, one potential approach to control the stability of the magnetic nano-suspensions and their behavior under the MF is to use the zeta potential.\nFig. 16 presents the dependence of the CHF enhancement ratio on mass concentration of nano-suspension for different values of zeta potential after 1000 min of operation to allow the NPs to deposit on the surface. As can be seen, the highest value of CHF enhancement ratio belongs to the case with zeta potential of 15 mV, in which nanosuspension had the most instable behavior, followed by þ20 mV, in which nano-suspension is still unstable but with lower deposition rate. In this condition, despite the presence of the MF, NPs tend to form a sedimentation layer on the heating section, as the particle-particle and particle-surface attractive forces are higher than the repulsive ones. Therefore, NPs can stick to each other, agglomerate and deposit on the surface. With more NPs deposited on the surface, the thicker fouling layer is formed on the surface. Therefore, capillary action within the layer is intensified resulting in the enhancement of the CHF. However, for zeta potential values of 45 mV and þ60 mV, due to the superior stability of the NPs, fouling layer is not significantly thick and porous. Therefore, capillary action is not as strong as the cases of 15mV and þ20 mV. Therefore, for the test nano-suspensions, the presence of MF did not change the mechanism of the CHF enhancement.\nFig. 17 presents the dependence of the boiling HTC on the mass concentration of the nano-suspension for various zeta potential values after 1000 min of operation. As can be seen, for the cases with zeta potential in the range of 15 mV and þ20 mV, the nano-suspensions are instable and the HTC decreases as NPs deposit on the surface. In this case, NPs tend to deposit on the surface rather than to follow the MF. However, at zeta potential of 45 mV and þ60 mV, the MF has increased the HTC, which is largely due to the migration of the NPs in conjunction with the applied MF. In these values of zeta potential, NPs follow the MF, which intensifies the Brownian motion and location agitation of NPs. These findings are in a good agreement with those reported in the literature [4,5,20]. Therefore, zeta potential is not only a key parameter associated with the stability of the nano-suspension, but also an important parameter for assessing the deposition rate of a\nferro-fluid in the vicinity of a MF, meaning that a MF can enhance or deteriorate the HTC depending on the value of the zeta potential of the nano-suspension.\nM.M.

      "text" : "To investigate the influence of the deposition of the nano-suspension on the surface, the contact angle of the nano-suspension droplet on the boiled surface was measured for the nano-suspension at wt.% ¼ 0.2 after 1000 min of boiling experiments. As can be seen in Fig. 18, with time spanning, the contact angle of the nano-suspension droplet and the boiling surface decreases as the amount of NPs deposit on the surface increases. For example, the contact angle of the nano-suspension droplet on a clean boiling surface is 87.9�, which decreases to 67.2� after 500 min of experiments and reaches 45.4� after 1000 min of experiments. This can cause the nano-suspension droplet to lie on the surface. This phenomenon results in larger contact area between the droplet and the porous layer of deposition causing more liquid to penetrate into the porous layer. Also, more liquid can remain in the porous layer, which results in a delay in CHF phenomenon. The same trend was also seen for other concentrations of nano-suspension. This behavior is independent from the concentration of the surfactant. Also, as can be seen in SEM images represented in Fig. 18, with time, the porosity of the layer increases which in turn enhances the capillary action of the surface and its capacity to store more liquid in the surface.\nOverall, the stability of the nano-suspension plays a major role on the enhancement of the HTC. According to the experimental results, a stable nano-suspension can provide the highest thermal conductivity in comparison with the instable nano-suspensions. This is because, employing the unstable nano-suspensions is associated with the scale formation and deposition of the NPs within the system. This deposition decreases the number of NPs dispersed within the base fluid resulting in a significant decrease in thermal conductivity of the nano-suspension. As the boiling HTC depends on various mechanisms including conduction heat transfer, the highest boiling HTC was seen for the most stable nanosuspension, in which the thermal conductivity is the highest [21]. On the other hand, the critical heat flux point (CHF) is a strong function of surface characteristics. An unstable nano-suspension creates a deposition layer on the surface. This layer is a porous layer, which can cover the surface, while also holds some amount of liquid within the void spaces. Also, the deposition layer changes the wettability of the surface such that the nano-suspension drop lies on the surface. Hence, a surface with a deposited layer of nano-suspension can keep more liquid in\ncontact with the heating surface, which resulting in a delay in the occurrence of the CHF phenomena [9]."

      "text" : "Particulate fouling and deposition of the NPs on the surface is the main challenge of using nano-suspensions in two-phase boiling systems. In the boiling micro-layer close to the boiling heating surface, the base fluid is evaporated and a concentrated layer of nano-suspension is formed, in which the particle-particle forces are sufficiently stronger than particle-fluid. Therefore, due to the agglomeration of particles, apparent density is increased, which intensifies the rate of deposition of clusters and NPs. The fouling layer offers a tradeoff between the enhancement of the CHF and the deterioration of the HTC. The former is due to the enhancement of the capillary action and the latter is due to the thermal resistance of surface, followed by a decrease in the number of the nucleation sites responsible for the bubble formation. During the boiling heat transfer of the nano-suspensions, initially, the agglomerated particles may increase the irregularities and micro-cavities of the surface; while study over the time showed that the agglomerated particles create a thick, continual and uniform surface, which decreases the number of active nucleation sites. Thus, stable nano-suspensions are expected to show better thermal performance over the extended time [22]. Fig. 19 presents the variation of the FTR with the operating time for the nano-suspension at wt. % ¼ 0.15 and at zeta potential of 45mV in the absence and also the presence of the MF applied to the boiling vessel. As can be seen, three domains of study were identified. Despite the stable behavior of the nano-suspension, the order of magnitude of thermal fouling resistance without the MF in some points is 15–25% larger than that of measured for the case in the presence of MF. Operating time is the key parameter in the formation of the fouling layer. At operating time <100 min, the surface is clean and for both cases, the FTR is zero. With time spanning, when 100 min < t < 880 min, the secondary domain is formed in which a weak fouling layer is formed, which increases the FTR up 0.087 m2. K/kW for the case without the MF and 0.067 m2. K/kW for the case with the MF. In this region, particles are stick to the weak fouling layer and fill the irregularities and micro-cavities of the surface together with the surface porosity. However, due to the bubble formation, the deposition of the particles and the\nM.M. Sarafraz et al.\nInternational Journal of Thermal Sciences 147 (2020) 106131\nremoval of the particles from surface due to the bubble formation reach an equilibrium in which the FTR remains constant, which is the final stage t ~1000 min. For all three domains, the FTR for the case with the MF was smaller than those of recorded in the absence of the magnetic. This shows that MF can potentially be a promising remedy and a mitigation to suppress the fouling formation of the nano-suspension. However, a robust device for measuring the thickness of the fouling is highly recommended to be developed. Also, further study on the particulate fouling is highly recommended to further develop a new insightful mechanistic model for predicting the particulate fouling of a ferro-fluid with and/or without a MF.\nLikewise, there are some fluctuations in FTR values, which is associated with the bubble interactions on the surface. When bubbles grow on the surface, they partially remove the fouling layer from the surface, which decreases the FTR and influences the local temperature profile of the surface. Since FTR is highly influenced by the HTC and the surface\ntemperature profile, any changes in the boiling surface causes a chaotic regime in the boiling micro-layer and results in some fluctuations within the experiments."

Water was selected as a coolant because it is transparent and imaging is possible rather than Fe3O4 nano-suspension, which is an obscure fluid. As can be seen in Fig. 20, for the surface covered by NPs under the MF, bubbles are smaller due to thin fouling layer on the surface. This is largely attributed to the effect of the MF, which suppresses the fouling formation of the NPs on the surface and as a result, bubble formation is also suppressed. In addition, for this surface, at higher HF, bubble coalescence phenomenon is also very small, creating less vapor blanket within the bulk of the fluid and delivers better heat transfer rate. However, for the surface covered by the NPs in the absence of the MF, at high HF, bubble coalescence is intensified, which reduces the heat transfer and also causes the CHF to occur at lower HF."

For the case in which MF was applied to the system, when zeta potential is 15 mV and þ20 mV, nanosuspensions were unstable and NPs deposited on the surface resulting in the decrease in HTC. However, for zeta potential 45 mV and þ60 mV, NPs followed the MF streamlines and due to the local\nM.M.

When\nzeta potential of the system was set at 15mV and þ20 mV, for wt. % ¼ 0.2, the maximum deposition and the maximum enhancement of CHF was observed. In addition, the more unstable, the nanosuspension, the larger, the CHF enhancement ratio. � An increase in the HF and the mass concentration was found to in-\ncrease the boiling HTC, however, for the mass concentration; there is a concentration at which the HTC was the highest which was at wt. % ¼ 0.15. In this concentration, the maximum enhancement of 44% was found for the HTC when MF of 1.0 T was applied to the system. � The concentration of the surfactant was found to decrease the CHF\nvalue semi-asymptotically, however, it slightly enhanced the boiling HTC. The experiments were limited to a narrow range of the concentration of the surfactant since it created a foamy medium and a layer of foam on the boiling surface."
