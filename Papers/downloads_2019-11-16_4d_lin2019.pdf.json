      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Recently, wearable electronic devices including electrical sensors, flexible displays, and health monitors have received widespread attention and experienced rapid evolution [1–4]. The wearable equipment leads to significant progress and essential need for flexible energy storage devices, such as flexible batteries and supercapacitors [5–8]. Compared with batteries, supercapacitors, boasting their high power density, long life cycles, and natural preparation process, are promising for applications in wearable devices [9–12]. However, in the long-time employment of these delicate supercapacitors, the devices inevitably suffer from bending, twisting or other deformations, causing irreversible damage even accidentally breaking. All of these failures would severely limit the reliability and lifetime, resulting in the breakdown of the whole electronic devices, generation of abundant electronic waste, as well as safety hazards. Meanwhile, the solid polymer electrolytes\nneed to have a superior ionic conductivity which can be comparable to that of liquid electrolyte [13,14]. Thus, we expect to design a supercapacitor with highly ionic conductivity and the ability to recover from structural damage.\nSelf-healing materials, which can spontaneously repair the internal or external damages, have been developed over the past decade years. Except for their capacity in restoring mechanical and structural performance, the functional self-healing is also the emphasis for research, which has been intensively studying in the recent [15–17]. Among the various self-healing materials, the non-covalent interactions hydrogels involving hydrogen bonding, host-guest interactions, and electrostatic interactions stand out, for their excellent electrochemical and stretchable performance besides highly healing efficiency [18–20]. To get better mechanical properties and self-healable performance, dual physical cross-linking (DPCL), e.g., ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding, is presented to construct novel hybrid double-network hydrogels. By\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.064 Received 2 November 2018; Received in revised form 7 January 2019; Accepted 10 February 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

Apart from that, breaking cross-links are able to respond to the rapid self-healing without the need for any outside stimulus [21,22]. The synthesis process of DPCL gels is quite facile, eco-friendly and compatible with aqueous acid electrolytes. However, the practical applications of the gels containing an acid solution as an electrolyte have rarely been reported.\nHerein, we synthesized a novel ferric enhancing dual physical crosslinking polyelectrolyte (Fe-DPCL). The copolymerization is proceeded using acrylic acid (AA) as a hydrophilic monomer and stearyl methacrylate (C18) as a hydrophobic monomer in an aqueous ferric nitrate solution with cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The Fe-DPCL hydrogel containing mild H2SO4 exhibits not only highly ionic conductive (> 30 mS cm−1) but also good self-healing efficiency besides high stretchability. Movable protons in the electrolyte provide an equivalent electrode capacitance compared with the conventional PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte. Based on this polyelectrolyte, supercapacitors can be facilely prepared by sandwiching the polymer gel with two identical electrodes, which are fabricated by electrochemical depositing nano-wire PANI on the carbon woven fibers, without extra components. The assembled self-healing supercapacitor exhibit the advantage of the excellent electrochemical performance, self-healable ability (∼86% efficiency after 7th healing behavior), aging durability (decrease slightly under ambient conditions over a month), and cycling stability."

Next, the solution was transferred to a Teflon mold (1×10 cm2) in a drying oven at 60 °C for 2 h. Hereafter, the prepared gels were immersed in various concentration of sulfuric acid. Finally, the Fe3+ ionic dual physical cross-linking (FeDPCL) electrolytes were obtained by washed resident acid on the surface and labeled as Fe-DPCL-x, where× stands for the concentration of sulfuric acid (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 mol)."

A three electrodes system was used to deposit PANI on the cleaned CWF working electrode with a Pt plate counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). The electrolyte used to deposit nano-wire PANI consisted of 1M HClO4 and 0.5M aniline monomer. Then, the electrodeposition was performed at a constant potential of 0.65 V at room temperature for the 1200 s (before the electrodeposition, the CWF is processed under ultrasonic bath to avoid the formation of bubbles at the interface). After\nthat, a dark green electrode was obtained. The PANI deposited on the CWF was weighed via a microbalance (Sartorius BSA224S, Germany)."

      "heading" : "3. Results and discussion",
      "text" : "Ferric ions enhancing dynamic physical cross-linking (Fe-DPCL) hydrogels containing sulfuric acid are prepared and used as both selfhealing substrate and electrolyte. The schematic illustration of the gel electrolyte is presented in Fig. 1a. Acrylic acid monomer, CTAB, and Fe (NO3)3 were polymerized together in the presence of KPS as the initiator. Sulfuric acid served as the regulator of water and proton ion content. We used several measurement methods, such as 1H NMR, FTIR, and XPS spectra, to characterize the polymerization process. Fig. 1b exhibits the 1H NMR spectra of Fe-DPCL (inset is corresponding chemical structures), in which the peaks A, B, E, and F can be assigned to the CTAB and C18, referring to the CH, CH2, and CH3 groups. The peak D is attributed to the repeating unit of PAA, and the C is from the solvent [23,24]. FTIR spectra were used to further prove the functional groups of the Fe-DPCL (Fig. 1c). The gel shows a broad peak at 3414 cm−1 for the eOH groups. The peaks in 2923 cm−1 and 2853 cm−1 are for the asymmetric stretching vibration and symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene groups, respectively. The C]O stretching vibration of the eCOOH group is presented in 1708 cm−1 [25]. Then, we performed the XPS measurement to detect the Fe element. The full XPS spectrum in Fig. 1d presents the signals of C, O, N, Fe, Br elements, which clearly shows the existence of Fe element. Moreover, the XPS peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 appear at 710 and 724 eV accompanied with a satellite peak at 716.4 eV, which is in accordance with previous reports [26].\nThe above results indicate the successful polymerization of the hydrogel. As shown in Figs. S1 and S2a, the fabricated Fe-DPCL displays reddish-brown solid with molecular weight Mn of 8564 gmol−1 which is obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement. The TG-DSC results exhibit the good thermal stability up to 239 ℃ (Fig. S2b), which is suitable for wearable application in the ambient temperature. The PAA chains provide intermolecular hydrogen bonding, while ferric ions serve as ionic bonds combined with covalent bonds, thus enhancing the mechanical and thermal properties of the gels. Furthermore, non-sacrificial hydrogen bond and ionic bond crosslinking are essential for self-healing, which can dynamically recombine and homogenize the network under stretching. Finally, the proper content of acid would be able to provide the most favorable ionic conductivity. It is noticed that the gel would turn the original reddish brown into semitransparent after immersing in acid (Fig. S1), which also influence the property, such as mechanical and self-healing performance. Therefore, we should find out the most suitable acid content to keep a balance between the conductivity of the gel and effect on its physical performance.\nTensile measurements were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the gel. Fig. 2a shows typical stress–strain curves of FeDPCL gels with various acid concentration and the detailed results are summarised in Table S1. The pristine gel has outstanding tensile property, whose fracture stress is 273 kPa and strain is ∼1900%. It is due to the interaction between ferric ions and anionic surfactant CTAB providing a stable hydrophobic association. In addition, the ionic crosslinking between Fe3+ and carboxylic acid groups in acrylic acid synergistically enhances the tensile strength [25]. Besides, the tensile curves show that proper H2SO4 content (0.5–2mol L−1) could effectively increase the elongation of gels. Especially in the case of Fe-DPCL1, the strain could exceed 2400% until rupture (Fig. S3), which is even higher than stretchable polymers without self-healable ability [20,27–30]. However, we observe a dramatical decreasing in both tensile stress and strain when the concentration of acid is over 2mol L−1, i.e., Fe-DPCL-3 and Fe-DPCL-5. The problem might be due to the high level of hydrogen ion and low water content which constrain the mobility of the PAA chains, resulting in the rigid of the chains. Tensile\ncurves after multiple self-healing are obtained to evaluate the selfhealing efficiency of mechanical performance (Fig. 2b and Table S2). Apparently, the mechanical performance is able to restore after several breaking/recovering behaviors. The tensile strength is well maintained at approximately 89% after 4th healing, implying its effective healable ability. The procedure is shown by optical images (Fig. 2c), we cut the rectangular the specimen into two halves, and the specimen is successfully healed when subsequently put back under mild pressure. The scar on the surface almost disappeared, and the gel could be stretched extensively without breaking. Mechanical recovery is further proved by the specimen belt hanging a 100 g mass after cutting/recovering three times (Fig. 2d).\nExcept for the requirement for mechanical robustness, facile ion transport, i.e., high ion conductive ability, are also essential. We tested the ionic conductivity by a three electrodes system in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1MHz (Fig. S4). According to previous reports [20,31], the ionic conductivity (σ) of an electrolyte, given by the Equation =σ l AR/( )b , depends upon the resistance (Rb), the thickness (l) and the area (A) of the gel. Fig. 3a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves, which determined the bulk resistance of the electrolyte. The calculated conductivities demonstrate that after the addition of 0.5–2mol H2SO4, the gel conductivities are much higher than conventional PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte and polymer electrolytes, reaching 25.7, 33.69, 31.79 mS cm−1, respectively [15,20,32,33]. However, a further increasing acid concentration leads to less water content, making ions move more difficult. In this case, the PAA chains are unlikely to sufficiently extended, which has been demonstrated by the above-mentioned tensile test.\nAccording to the equation =σ nqμ, the conductivity (σ) of an electrolyte can be influenced by the carrier concentration (n) and mobility (μ). The ion mobility (μ) is inversely related to the viscosity (η) of the electrolyte as =μ q πrη/6 (q is the electronic charge; r is the effective hydrodynamic radius) [34]. Therefore, a proper increasing sulfuric acid concentration would bring large amounts of protons, resulting in the remarkably increase in conductivity. The superior conductivity of Fe-DPCL-1 may be due to several reasons: 1) The addition of water leads to a decrease in the viscosity, increasing mobility. 2) The more swollen gel network provides the larger ionic conducting pathways. 3) The existence of ferric ion and hydrophobic bonds constitute a conducting network.\nFig. 3b presents the plots of ionic conductivities of Fe-DPCL gels versus various healing times. After a couple of breaking/healing cycles, the ionic conducting properties of the hydrogels with low concentrate acid content (< 2 mol) could be well restored, especially Fe-DPCL-1, whose conductivity still exceeds 30 mS cm−1 after 4th healing. However, the conductive performance of Fe-DPCL-3 and Fe-DPCL-5 are significantly influenced, which is ascribed to low self-restore ability. Fig. 3c exhibits a valid application of the hydrogel as conducting wires in a tandem circuit, monitored by a standard commercial light-emitting diode (LED) bulb. For the Fe-DPCL-1 gel, the LED lamp successfully lights up at a voltage of 2.0 V, while the gel without sulfuric acid does not show the ability to substitute a conductive wire under the same voltage. The insulative property of the Fe-DPCL is observed by a multimeter (Fig. 3c), implying the ionic conductive property of gel. We then bisected the self-healing gel and put them back, and the extinguished bulb lights up immediately (Fig. S5), demonstrating its self-healing property.\nCarbon weaved fabric (CWF) covered with nano-wire PANI (NWPANI) is utilized as electrodes to construct self-healing solid-state supercapacitors. The electrodeposited nano-wire PANI serves as active materials, providing large capacitance via a rapid redox reaction. In a typical process, two identical PANI@CWF were directly paved on the Fe-DPCL-1 polyelectrolyte without a separator (Fig. 4a). The rectangle region in Fig. 4b is where the NW-PANI deposited and serves as an energy storage area. It is noticed that a part of CWF should remain as electrode tabs which can be used to connect with outside circuits or\nother capacitors. The morphology of electrodes and the electrochemical properties of PANI@CWF self-healing supercapacitors are discussed below.\nThe nano-wire PANI (NW-PANI) on the CWF can be observed on SEM images (Fig. 4c and d). The colored SEM images elucidate the randomly oriented and entangled nanostructure of PANI on the surface of CWF (green color). For comparison, the morphology of the carbon fibers shown in Fig. S6 displays a smooth and defect-free surface with a high electron conductivity and robust mechanical properties. The highmagnification SEM in Fig. 4d illustrates wire-like structures, with ∼260 nm in diameter and a few micrometers in length. Such nanostructure makes the surface of the carbon rough and can be expected to provide significant enhancement in the active surface area for highperformance electrochemical capacitors. Moreover, the binder-free interface benefits a rapid electron-transfer, providing an extra capacitance [35].\nThe PANI coating is further investigated by FTIR, Raman, and XPS analyses, as shown in Fig. S7. Fig. S7a shows the FTIR spectra of PANI/ CWF electrodes; the PANI/CWF composite exhibits stretching\nvibrations of C–H at 1140 and 817 cm−1 and the C=C stretching vibration of the quinoid and benzenoid rings at 1590 and 1485 cm−1, respectively [36,37]. The Raman spectrum (Fig. S7b) of the electrode shows peaks centered at 1347 and 1592 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G carbon bands. Additional characteristic peaks occur at 1330, 1466 and 1580 cm−1, which are ascribed to the semi-quinone radical vibration. The C-N stretch mode of polaronic units appears at 1221 cm−1 [38,39]. XPS is performed to measure the elemental composition and electronic state of the samples. Fig. S7c shows the survey spectra of the NW-PANI electrode. The peaks in the curves reveal the presence of C, O, and N elements. The signals of the N 1s core-level is shown in Fig. S7d, which subsequently divided into two peaks. The divided peaks are benzenoid amine (eNHe) with binding energy at 399.6 eV and a positive charge nitrogen atom (N+) located at 401.2 eV, respectively [40]. According to the evidence above, we can conclude that we successfully deposit the NW-PANI on the CWF.\nThen, we evaluate the electrochemical performance of the symmetric self-healing supercapacitors using Fe-DPCL-1 as the electrolyte. We present the CV curves with various electrodeposition time in Fig.\nS8a, corresponding specific capacitance and weight loading are showed in Fig. S8b (Supporting Information). The enclosed area of the NWPANI with the deposition time of 1200 s is clearly much larger than others, indicating its highest specific capacitance. Both the specific capacitance and NW-PANI weight loading have a similar changing trend (Fig. S8b). With the increase of deposition time, the capacitance and loading weight increase first and then decrease; however, the largest loading weight of the device in 1800 s (3.1 mg) could lead to performance degradation. Furthermore, the longer deposition time would result in the exfoliation of the active materials.\nWe further compare the performance of the supercapacitors assembled with Fe-DPCL hydrogel and conventional PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte. Representative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at scan rates of up to 200mV s−1 in the potential range of 0–0.8 V are shown in Fig. 5a. The CV curves exhibit two pairs of apparent redox peaks, which are attributed to the leucoemeraldine and emeraldine transitions of PANI, revealing the significant pseudocapacitance behavior during charging/ discharging process [41]. A slightly increased polarisation is observed as the potential difference between the peaks of reduction and oxidation goes up with the increase of the sweep rate [42], while the similar shape maintains well because of its good rate behavior. Fig. 5b shows the charge/discharge voltage profiles at current densities from 1.67 to 33.33 A g−1 in the voltage window of 0–0.8 V. The pseudocapacitive behavior is further confirmed by the nonlinear profile. Meanwhile, these representative voltage plateaus agree well with the peaks observed in the CV curves. From the plots of peak current density (Ip) versus sweep rate from 10 to 200mV s−1 for both cathodic and anodic peaks, the current follows well a power-law relationship with the scan rate, i.e., = avIp b, where a and b both are constants. Whereas a b-value\nof 0.5 would indicates that the current is controlled by semi-infinite linear diffusion, while a value of 1 indicates that the current is surfacecontrolled [43,44]. The b value can be determined by the slope of log (Ip) versus log (v) function (Fig. 5c), which is between 0.5 and 1.0. In our case, the b values are 0.88 for the cathodic sweep and 0.89 for the anodic sweep, respectively. Clearly, it can be concluded that the electrode kinetics under the conditions is mainly attributed to the surfacecontrolled process.\nAs for PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. S9), CV curve shows asymmetric rectangular shape with only one pair of the broad peak, indicating that the ion transfer takes place more difficult in the traditional electrolyte for its relatively low ionic conductivity [45,46]. In addition, the iR drops of Fe-DPCL devices are smaller than that of PVA electrolyte (Fig. S9b). It is found that smaller iR drop of 0.07 V in self-healing electrolyte reveal a lower internal resistance compared to that of 0.15 V in PVA gel. As shown in Fig. 5b and S7d, the specific capacitance of the device assembled by Fe-DPCL electrolyte obtained from the discharge curves are 217.43, 210.29, 198.67, 183.53, 169.2, and 166.7F g−1 at current densities of 1.67, 3.33, 8.33, 12.5, 16.67, and 33.33 A g−1, respectively. About 76.8% of the capacitance can be retained with an increase in the current density, suggesting good rate capability. This value is 73% for the result calculated from CV curves (Fig. S9c). Compared with the FeDPCL electrolyte, the capacitor with PVA gel delivers a similar trend. The capacitor has an even better electrochemical capacitance in the low current density/scan rate, which subsequently decreases with a larger slope. The relatively poor performance might be due to the higher internal resistance.\nElectrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was conducted to gain insight into the charge transfer behavior. The Nyquist plots are shown\nin the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10MHz in the Fig. 4d. According to the best-fitted results listed in Table S3 (inset of Fig. 5d is the corresponding equivalent circuit), the equivalent series resistance (ESR, Rs) of two different gel electrolytes are evaluated to be 1.73 and 2.88Ω, respectively. The ESR value is a combination of ionic resistance of the electrolyte, intrinsic resistance of active materials, and contact resistance. Therefore, the lower Rs value of Fe-DPCL suggests a lower gel resistance. Meanwhile, the other parameters are quite close, implying their similar capacitive behaviors, which is consistent with the analysis of CVs and GCDs above. The higher conductivity of Fe-DPCL electrolyte can be confirmed by bode plots (Fig. 5e). As can be seen, Fe-DPCL at a phase angle of –45° showed a characteristic frequency ( f0) of 79 Hz, which is higher than that of PVA gel (20 Hz). These facts can be well explained by the better gel ionic conductivity [47]. Correspondingly, the relaxation time (τ0) constant evaluated by the equation =τ f1/0 0 (the minimum time needed to discharge all the energy from the device at an efficiency of> 50%) is ∼1.26 s for Fe-DPCL gel, while the relaxation time of PVA electrolyte is∼ 5.03 s (inset of Fig. 5e). A smaller τ defines a higher percentage of useful capacitive energy, which means a better rate performance [48]. Therefore, Fe-DPCL with better ionic conductive behavior brings the better electrochemical performance of the device.\nThe Ragone plot of the NW-PANI devices is shown in Fig. 5f and the detailed results are listed in Table S4. The self-healing supercapacitor can deliver energy densities up to 19.33 and 14.81 Wh kg−1 (1.58 and 1.21 mWh cm−3) at power densities of 0.67 and 17.78 kW kg−1 (18.18 and 483.67 mW cm−3), respectively, obviously superior to other selfhealing capacitors, e.g., fiber springs (0.94 mWh cm−3 at 7.32 mW cm−3) [49] and BrGO (10.5 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 kW kg−1) [50]. Notably, the energy densities of our capacitors are also higher than those of recently reported symmetric supercapacitors with tradition electrolytes\n(Table S4), such as carbon/MnO2 (0.22 mWh cm−3) [51], MnO2/ZnO nanowire (0.04 mWh cm−3) [52], PPy/MnO2/rGO (1.1 mWh cm−3) [53], carbonized kapok fiber/NiO (7.5 Wh kg−1) [54], and MoS2 (5 Wh kg−1) [55]. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of the devices.\nThe self-healable polyelectrolyte promises the mechanical and electronic self-healing properties of the supercapacitor. The high flexible property of the assembled device is demonstrated via CV measurement under different deformation condition. As shown in the schematic diagram (Fig. S10a), the test is performed by fixing deformation under bending or twisting state. Comparison of NW-PANI capacitors under these conditions shows that the curves can remain similar shapes with two pairs of redox peaks (Fig. S10b). The excellent flexible performance is attributed to used flexible components (carbon weaved fiber electrodes and Fe-DPCL electrolyte), which would not suffer severe capacitance losses under deformation.\nThe self-healing ability of the capacitors is tested by obtaining the electrochemical performance after cutting/healing process. Here, silver paste is used to reduce resistance caused by the misalignment between the broken electrodes. As shown in Fig. 6a, the shapes of CV curves show no noticeable deviation before and after self-healing behavior. Even after 7th self-restored, the significant two pairs of redox peaks of PANI can be observed, suggesting the capacitive behavior of our healable capacitor remains nearly the same. The obtained result is consistent with the charge/discharge test results as shown in Fig. 6b, further demonstrating that the redox reactions are not affected by selfhealing. The EIS is used to study the electrochemical behaviors of the self-healing supercapacitors further, and the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6c. The ESRs of the capacitors before cutting and after first healing are 1.7 and 2.6Ω, respectively, and then gradually increase to 3.12Ω after 5th healing behaviors. Finally, the resistance achieved 6.3Ω after\n7th healing. Because of proper reconnection of the electrode and the function of silver gel on the wound, the first and second impedance spectra nearly mixed. Moreover, the knee frequency on Nyquist plots does not change obviously after 5th healing, which suggests their similar physisorption concerning electrolyte ions, and energy-storage capacities [56,57].\nWe calculated specific capacitances of our healable supercapacitor via CVs and GCDs (Fig. 6d). After the 7th healing, the capacitance retention ratios calculated from the CV and GCD curves are about 82%\nand 86%, respectively, indicating a highly restorable capacitance. These results reveal both electrochemical performance and self-healing efficiency advantages of adopting our Fe-DPCL electrolyte over previous reported self-healable supercapacitors (Fig. S11) [17,49,56,58]. Interestingly, the electrical performance of the first healing cycle is slightly better than the origin device. The reason might be due to the adjustment between the broken electrodes. Fig. 6e shows four selfhealing supercapacitors connected in series to power an LED bulb. The electrode tabs of devices are touched together and then fixed by metal\nclips. Before breaking, the supercapacitors light up the LED successfully, and without a doubt, the LED extinguishes immediately after breaking. As expected, the LED is lit up again with almost the same brightness after the broken electrodes reconnect and self-restore (the inset of the image is the magnification of the self-healing wounds where silver paste used to reduce resistance can be observed).\nTo elucidate the performance durability of the supercapacitors, the aging test is performed based on the Fe-DPCL-1 electrolyte over a period of 21 days under ambient conditions. The measurements are carried out by testing the CVs performance of the devices every few days and obtaining their capacitances. These results can be seen in Fig. 7a, in addition to its excellent self-healing and electrochemical performance, the self-healing device exhibits a remarkable long-time aging performance, and the good electrochemical capacitance can be remained ∼85% of the original one after storing under ambient\nconditions for 21 days. In the case of PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte, the performance of the capacitor decreases dramatically, and CV curves deviate from the original rectangle shape and display features of a resistor after mere one week (Fig. S12), which mainly arises from the higher ionic transfer resistance owing to the diffusion limitation [59,60]. The reason of highly capacitance retention of Fe-DPCL could be attributed to its good water-holding ability [20], which can hold 86% of original weight even after a period over one month (Fig. S13), ensuring the ionic mobility in the electrolyte.\nThe cyclability and performance durability of the device was further investigated before and after healing through galvanostatic charge/ discharge tests, which were carried out up to 2000 cycles at a current density of 8.33 A g−1. Most of the degradation occurs in the first 200 cycles for both the original and complete healing device, while no visible degradation is observed in the rest of the cycles. Finally, about\n80% of the capacitance is reserved (Fig. 7b). For comparison, the value is 73% for the device after cutting and self-healing behavior, indicating its good cycling and self-healing properties. It is noticed that bare PANI particles based electrodes exhibit a rapid decrease in its performance, reaching>50% loss of the initial capacitance [41]. In the one way, the PANI particles without protection are easily flaked off during the charge/discharge process. For NW-PANI electrodes, the tangle wires can serve as a stress buffer and prevent themselves from peeling off. In the other way, the higher viscosity of polyelectrolyte and well compatible with the electrode further limit the volume change of active materials, achieving considerable cycling stability. The aging durability and cycling stability presented here are quite suitable for practical application as flexible and wearable electronics."

      "text" : "In summary, we fabricated a self-healing polyelectrolyte by dual physical crosslinked with hydrogen and ionic bonding and assembled the self-healable supercapacitors based on it, which used two identical electrodeposited PANI electrodes. The hydrogel bond and ferric ionic bond provide the polyelectrolyte with good mechanical performance, which can reach higher than 2400% strain and 230 kPa, and favorable self-healing ability. Benefited from its high ionic conductivity even after breaking/healing behavior, the assembled supercapacitors show the excellent energy density of 19.33 Wh kg−1 at power densities of 0.67 kW kg−1 and self-healing ability achieving 86% capacitance retention after 7th self-recovery. Also, the good water-holding ability and compatibility with electrodes of the polyelectrolyte provide the devices with good durability performance, which can remain 85% capacitance after one month under ambient conditions, and cycling stability of∼ 80% and 73% of capacitance retention before and after self-healable ability. Therefore, we show the vast potential of self-healing gel system in flexible electronics and provides a useful strategy to design self-healing devices in this work."

Herein, we report a ferric enhancing dual physical cross-linking polyelectrolyte for supercapacitors. The gel electrolyte is copolymerized by using acrylic acid as a hydrophilic monomer and stearyl methacrylate as a hydrophobic monomer in an aqueous ferric nitrate solution with cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and subsequently immersed in the sulfuric acid solution. With the help of hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding, the prepared hydrogel containing 1mol L H2SO4 exhibits good mechanical performance (extensibility> 2400%, and stress> 230 kPa), excellent ionic conductive (> 30 mS cm), and good self-healing efficiency. Base on this polyelectrolyte, we successfully assemble the self-healing supercapacitor by two identical electrodeposited nano-wire PANI electrodes. The self-healing device achieves an excellent energy density of 19.33 Wh kg at power densities of 0.67 kW kg, self-healable ability (∼86% capacitance retention after healing behavior), aging durability, and cycling stability. Our results provide a valid and straightforward strategy to design self-healing energy storage devices.",
