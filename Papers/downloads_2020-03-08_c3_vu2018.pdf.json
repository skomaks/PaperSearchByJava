      "text" : "Epoxy resins are some of the most important synthesized organic engineering matrices used widely in the fabrication of composite materials because of their excellent mechanical properties along with low shrinkage during curing and ease of processing. Depending on the chemical structure of the epoxy resin, these resins have been applied to many industrial fields, including the aerospace, automotive, and marine construction industries [1], owing to their desirable physical, mechanical properties, thermal stability, and chemical resistance. Although the epoxy resin plays a vital role in industrial engineering fields due to the high density crosslink after curing, the epoxy becomes brittle and is being destroyed easily by low energy, which limits their use in numerous engineering applications requiring high toughness [2]. For that reason, researchers attempt to overcome this brittleness problem by introducing an intermediary phase through blending or chemical\nmodification reactions. Improving the toughness of pristine epoxy resin can be achieved by adding various materials, such as elastomer [3,4], thermoplastic [5] or solid particles, such as silica [6,7], graphene [8,9], graphene oxide [10], aluminum beads [11,12], and core-shell nanoparticles [13]. The introduction of sustainable reinforcement materials for enhancing the fracture toughness of epoxy resin has also been a major research focus due to the huge advantages to the environment [14–20].\nOne of the most important reinforcement materials for composites until now is the glass fiber, which has been considered a traditional reinforcement material for both thermoplastics [21–24] and thermoset resins [25–27] with its many beneficial characteristics, such as chemical resistance, high mechanical strength, and compatibility. Although glass fibers have been used in composite materials for a long time, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are few reports of the use of nano/micro glass fibers as a reinforcement material.

[28] evaluated nano-epoxy composite resins containing electro-spun glass nanofibers, in which electro-spun glass (structurally amorphous SiO2) nanofibers (EGNFs) with diameters of 400 nm were incorporated into an epoxy resin for reinforcement and/or toughening purposes. The effects of the silanization treatment (including different functional groups in silane molecules) and mass fraction of EGNFs on the strength, stiffness, and toughness of the resulting nano-epoxy composite resins were investigated. The experimental results showed that EGNFs substantially out-performed conventional glass fibers with diameters of ∼10 μm in both tension and impact tests, and led to the same trend of improvements in strength, stiffness, and toughness at small mass fractions of 0.5 and 1%. The silanization treatment of EGNFs improved the fiber matrix interfacial bonding strength and mechanical properties of the corresponding composite resins. The silanized EGNFs with epoxy end groups (G-EGNFs) showed a stronger toughening effect, while the silanized EGNFs with amine end groups showed a higher degree of reinforcement. Compared to the neat epoxy resin, the incorporation of 1% EGNFs increased the tensile strength, Young's modulus, work of fracture (WOF), and impact strength by 12%, 33%, 52%, and 322%, respectively. In contrast, the incorporation of 1% G-EGNFs increased the tensile strength, Young's modulus, WOF, and impact strength by 31%, 40%, 67%, and 363%, respectively.\nThis study examined the effects of nGF on the fracture toughness, mechanical properties, surface morphology, and thermal properties of epoxy resin using diethylenetriamine (DETA) as a low temperature curing agent. The surface of the nGF was also modified with amino groups prior to introduction to the epoxy resin to make a strong connection between the matrix and reinforcement phase."

The temperature of ultrasonication processing was kept at 90 °C in order to improve the dispersion of filler in resin. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature, and kept for one day for further experiments. Subsequently, the calculated amount of curing agent was added, stirred carefully to avoid the formation of bubbles, and then poured into a steel mold that had previously been sprayed with a mold-release agent. The curing process was performed at room temperature for one day before removing the samples. All the samples were kept for a further one week at room temperature before testing.

      "text" : "The successful silanization of nGF was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, while the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) method also helped to determine its elemental distribution.\nOn the other hand, curing degree of the epoxy resin was measured using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (8000, Perkin Elmer). The resin and DETA were mixed at a stoichiometric epoxide/amine ratio (100:13) at low temperatures (0–5 K). The uncured samples (10 ± 2mg) were sealed in aluminium pans and heated at a scanning\nrate of 5 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 250 °C to calculate the total heat of the complete reaction (HT). The residual reaction heat (HR) for a sample cut from the middle of the laminate was thus obtained. The curing degree (α) of the composites was calculated:\n= −α H H H X 100%T R T (1)\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was further performed using a Perkin Elmer simultaneous TG/DTA instrument (Diamond SDTA), for which the samples were heated from 323 to 873 K under air atmosphere at a programmed heating rate of 10 Kmin-1.\nFor the mechanical properties, the critical stress intensity factor (KIC) of the samples was determined using a single edge notched beam (SENB) testing method in a three-point bending flexure. The V-notch tip was machined using a rotating saw, and the pre-crack of specimens was then generated by tapping on a fresh razor blade placed in the notch as seen in Fig. 4. The crack-to-width ratio (a/W) was limited to about 0.4 (to ensure in range from 0 to 1). The three-point bending test was performed on a universal testing machine (Lloyd 500N, England) according to the standards of the ASTM D5045-99 test method. The critical stress intensity factor (KIC) was determined according to the following equations:\n=K P\nBW f x. ( )IC 1 2 (2)\nwhere P is the maximum load seen on the load-displacement diagram, B is the specimen thickness, W is the width, and a is the initial crack length.\nTensile testing was also carried out on dumbbell-shaped samples (ASTM D638-91, Type I) using a universal testing machine (Instron model 5582-100 KN). The measurements were carried out at room\ntemperature at an extension rate of 2mmmin−1. The tensile stress–strain curve provides the ultimate tensile strength, which is defined as the maximum stress, ultimate elongation at break and Young's modulus. The flexural test was performed using an Instron (5582-100 KN) following the ASTM D790-86 test method using a three-point bend configuration with a sample size of 5× 10×100mm3. All the mechanical property values were obtained by averaging five experimental values. Regarding the viscoelastic characteristics, both the storage modulus and tanδ curves were determined using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA8000) according to ISO 6721–1. The neat epoxy and composite samples, 50mm long x 8mm wide x 2mm thick, were tested using a three-point bending method at various temperatures between ambient and 200 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min and a frequency of 1.0 Hz. The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the composites was also determined from the maxima of the tanδ curves. On the other hand, the fractured surfaces of the samples were examined further by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Jeol JSM 6360, Japan)."

      "text" : "The morphology of nGF was characterized by SEM, as shown in Fig. 2. Most of the nGF had a diameter ranging from 200 nm to 500 nm, and a small part had a diameter of approximately 800 nm with a length from 500 μm to 1500 μm. To enhance the compatibility between nGF and epoxy resin, the nGF were modified with an amino silane coupling agent. Fig. 5 shows the FT-IR spectra of both nGF and nGF-NH2.\nThe FT-IR spectra of nGF (black line) displayed a symmetric stretching vibration of SieO at 781 cm−1 and an asymmetric stretching vibration of SieOeSi at 960 cm−1. The peak at 960 cm−1 also was assigned for SieOH stretching. After treatment with the APS, new peaks were observed at 2890 cm−1, which was assigned to the CH2e stretching vibration in the coupling agent. The peak at 1556 cm−1 corresponds to the eNH2 bending vibration of the functional amino group presented in the coupling agent. These results are also in agreement with other published work [30]. In addition, the success of silanization processing was also confirmed again with help of the EDS as seen in Fig. 6. The appearance of both C and N peaks in the EDS spectra of nGF-NH2 when compared with EDS spectra of nGF showed the success of silanization processing. Beside it, both EDS spectra of nGF and nGF-NH2 showed the peaks of Si, Al, Ca, and O, meaning that the composition of glass fiber included SiO2, Al2O3, and CaO.\nBoth the dispersion and compatibility of the fiber on epoxy resin are key factors that can affect the final properties of the materials and need to be assessed. The dispersion of micro-fibrils in the matrix can improve\nthe effectiveness of processing of the silane-treated micro-fibril. The main aim of silane-treated micro-fibril is to enhance the compatibility and dispersion, while avoiding the aggregation of fibers in the matrix. The compatibility and dispersion of the nano/micro fibrils in the EP were observed by SEM after the nano/micro fibrils were dispersed into the EP matrix prior curing processing as shown in Fig. 7.\nThe SEM images in both Fig. 7 (A) (for 0.2 phr nGF-NH2 in epoxy resin) and Fig. 7 (B) (for 0.3 phr nGF-NH2 in epoxy resin) show that nGF-NH2 provided a good dispersion in the epoxy matrix for all samples without aggregation. All nano/micro fibrils were separated from each other and appeared like individual single fibers. These results also confirmed the effectiveness of silane treatment processing on the fiber surface [31].\nThe effect of filler on the curing degree of epoxy plays a vital role in the final properties of composite. In this work, the curing degree of epoxy with and without fillers was investigated via the DSC method as presented in Fig. 8. The slope of curing degree curves can be also used to determine the curing reaction rate of each epoxy based sample. Results in Fig. 8 showed that all the samples approached to a fully cured state when the temperature reached around 250 °C. However, the slopes of these curves were different. The slope of epoxy filled with 0.2 nGFNH2 seemed to be higher than those of pristine epoxy, EP/0.1 nGF-NH2, and EP/0.2 nGF. The curing degree curve of pristine epoxy resin exhibited also the lowest slope. At the same temperature, the curing degree of epoxy filled with 0.2 nGF-NH2 was higher than those of pristine epoxy, EP/0.1 nGF-NH2, and EP/0.2 nGF, implying that the curing reaction rate was increased with the presence of filers especially the nGFNH2. It could be believed that the eNH2 groups on the surface of silanized nGF exerted a catalytic effect for epoxide ring opening.\nThe fracture toughness (KIC) of the resin measured by the SENB test is plotted as a function of the weight percentage of the fillers for each filler type, as shown in Fig. 9.\nThe fracture toughness increased with the addition of nGF-NH2 to the epoxy resin and reached the maximum value at 0.2 phr nGF-NH2. The neat epoxy resin was quite brittle, with a KIC value of 0.63 ± 0.015MPam1/2. In contrast, the epoxy resin containing 0.2 phr nGF-NH2 had a KIC value of 0.95 ± 0.02MPam1/2, which is 50.79% higher than that of the neat epoxy resin. Those increases in toughening were attributed to crack deflection and crack pinning processes at the obstacles. In addition, the good adhesion between the fibers and epoxy matrix of the composite, and the good energy-absorbing capacity of the fibers dispersed in the matrix could further explained. On the other hand, considering the nGF structure with its length from 500 μm to 1500 μm, the one directional (1-D) fillers may bridge the crack, thus restricting the crack propagation during the failure process [32–35]. By comparison, it is easy to realize that the epoxy filled with 0.2 phr nGF had KIC value higher than pristine EP, however lower than epoxy filled with 0.1 phr nGF-NH2. These results confirmed again the effect of silanization processing on improvement the fracture toughness of epoxy resin. Fig. 10 shows the vital role of the APS on modification of the fiber surface as well as incorporation in the epoxy matrices.\nThe APS-coupling agent possessing an amino functional group in its structure helped the incorporation of nGF into the epoxy resin via a curing process, resulting in improved fracture toughness [31]. Note that crucial role of the surface modification on determining the final performance of the composites has been also studied [36–39].\nThe mechanical performance of the neat epoxy resin, nGF, and the nGFeNH2emodified epoxy resin was evaluated using both the flexural test and tensile test. Tables 1 and 2 present the flexural and tensile properties of the pristine epoxy, nGF/epoxy, and nGF-NH2/epoxycomposites for different filler loadings, respectively.\nThe flexural strength (σf) was determined using a three-point bending test, which was calculated using the following equation:\n=σ 3PL 2bdf 2 (5)\nwhere P is the applied load (N); L is the span length (mm); b is the specimen width (mm), and d is the specimen thickness (mm).\nAs observed, the flexural strength and modulus significantly increased with increasing the nGF content, and reached the highest value at 0.2 phr nGF, in which the composites showed ∼10% (from 93.80 ± 2.51 to 103.26 ± 3.36MPa) and ∼2.5% (from 2.06 ± 0.011 to 2.11 ± 0.014 GPa) increase in the flexural strength\nand modulus. By comparison, the composites containing the nGF-NH2 exhibited higher flexural strength and modulus values than the nGF counterparts over the whole filler contents studied. For an epoxy composite with 0.2 phrnGF-NH2, the flexural strength and modulus increased by∼28.57% (from 93.80 ± 2.51 to 120.6 ± 2.61MPa) and ∼30.09% (from 2.06 ± 0.011 to 2.68 ± 0.014 GPa), respectively. The higher value of mechanical properties and toughness of epoxy filled with nGF-NH2 when compared with NGF filled epoxy resin samples confirmed the effectiveness of silanization processing. At the curing condition (room temperature), the eNH2 group can open the oxirane ring to make the covalent bond while the eOH can make the hydrogen bond with epoxy chain. On the other hand, as for the tensile strength and modulus of the epoxy based composites, they exhibited similar trends such that the strength and modulus values of the nGF-NH2/ epoxy composites were consistently higher than the GO/epoxy counterparts. The tensile strength, tensile modulus, and maximum strain of\nthe epoxy filled with 0.2 phr nGF-NH2 were improved 32.67% (from 45.6 ± 2.23 to 60.52 ± 2.12MPa), 23.07% (from 0.91 ± 0.011 to 1.12 ± 0.016 GPa), and 28.88% (from 4.5 ± 0.012 to 5.8 ± 0.018%), respectively, when compared with pristine EP and then reached optimum values. However, the increase of fillers content to 0.3 phr induced the decreasing tendency of mechanical properties due to the re-agglomerate phenomenon of nano-materials similar to previous reports [40–42].\nThe typical tensile stress-strain curves of the epoxy resin with the different contents of fillers was shown in Fig. 11.\nThe slopes of these curves increased with increasing nGF-NH2 loading, and the maximum of failure force reached at 0.2 phr of NGFNH2 incorporation in the epoxy resin. By comparison, we also realized that the slope of stress-strain of EP/0.2 phr nGF was higher than that of pristine EP, but lower than that of EP/0.1 phr nGF-NH2. Based on these results, 0.2 phr of nGF loading was chosen to compared with epoxy filled with different loadings of nGF-NH2.\nSubsequent to the KIC tests, the fracture surfaces of the neat epoxy and EP/0.2 phr nGF-NH2 composites were examined by SEM, as shown in Fig. 12.\nFig. 12(A) showed that the fractured surface of the cured pristine epoxy was smooth and glassy, which was typical brittle fracture behavior of the thermosetting resin. A smooth mirror-like surface with micro-flow lines was observed. On the other hand, the fractured surface of the modified epoxy with 0.2 phr of nGF-NH2 showed the shear-like patterns and the stick-slip patterns were observed, as shown in Fig. 12(B). The fractured surface was rougher and the jagged multiplane patterns were more apparent, requiring more energy [17]. The toughening effect could be attributed to the matrix crack encountered with obstacles (fiber bridging), which gradually deflected and altered the crack orientation [18].\nFurthermore, the effects of nGF-NH2 on thermal mechanical behavior of the EP were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Dynamic mechanical tests over a wide temperature range are quite sensitive to the physical and chemical structure of polymers and composites. They allow a study of the glass transitions or secondary transitions and yield information on the morphology of polymers. Fig. 13 shows the experimental results of the dynamic bending tests conducted on the composites over a temperature range from 25 to 200 °C.\nThe storage modulus for composites containing different loadings of nGF-NH2 was pushed to a higher level than the neat EP. This behavior can be explained in terms of the interfacial interactions between the nGF-NH2 and epoxy. The improved interfacial interactions due to nGFNH2 reduced the mobility of the local matrix material around the nGF [31]. The tanδ (values of the composites were calculated by dividing\nthe loss modulus by the corresponding storage modulus obtained from DMA), as shown in Fig. 13(B). Interestingly, the maximum tanσ for the virgin epoxy was lower than those of the composites containing nGFNH2, which could be attributed to adhesion between the nGF-NH2 and epoxy promoted energy dissipation from the matrix to the nGF. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the virgin epoxy resin and epoxy reinforced with 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 phr nGF-NH2 were 97.7 °C, 99.6 °C, 100.3 °C, and 103.9 °C, respectively (Fig. 12). The Tg of epoxy resin increased slightly in the presence of nGF-NH2. The Tg values in this study were averaged values from five data point of the sample. The\npresence of nGF-NH2 made a strong adhesion between fibers and matrix, leading to decrease of the segmental mobility of the polymer chain, thus resulting in the increase in Tg.\nThe improvement of the thermal stability of epoxy resin due to silanization processing can be confirmed by TGA results.\nAs seen in Fig. 14, all the samples exhibited the main weight loss at around 350–500 °C as a result of the degradation of epoxy network [36]. The decomposition temperature (Td at 5.0 wt% weight loss) of the unmodified and modified epoxy resin was measured and used as an evidence of indicating thermal stability. The Tds of cured pristine epoxy, epoxy filled with 0.2 phr of nGF, and nGF-NH2 were 270.1 °C, 290.5, and 294.3 °C, respectively. The improvement in Td with the presence of nGF-NH2 indicated the vital role of silanization processing in enhancement of thermal stability of the epoxy resin. The silanization processing helped improving the dispersion of nGF and interfacial interaction with the epoxy matrix as a result of enhancement of thermal stability of the epoxy resin [36]. The improved dispersion and interfacial interactions due to silane functionalization of nGF reduced the mobility of the local matrix around the nGF, offering a better barrier effect of nGF-NH2 retarding the volatilization of polymer decomposition products [50]. Moreover, the increased residual weight of the composites containing the nGF-NH2 was observed at 600 °C compared with the corresponding composites containing the nGF, which would be due to the formation of SiO2 after the thermal degradation of grafted APS molecules on the nGF surface."

The effects of these fillers on the characteristics of cured epoxy resin, such as compatibility, curing degree, fracture toughness, mechanical, morphological, and thermal properties, were examined. The addition of amine-functionalized nGF (nGF-NH2) to the epoxy resin resulted in improvements in their fracture toughness, and mechanical and thermal properties. The fracture toughness, tensile strength, and flexural strength of the epoxy resin in the presence of 0.2 phr nGF-NH2 were improved by 50.79%, 32.67%, and 28.88%, respectively, compared to the virgin epoxy resin. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a relatively rough surface with shear deformation and tortuous cracks, thereby inducing higher fracture toughness in the nGFeNH2emodified epoxy system. Thermal stability improvement of the epoxy with nGF-NH2 was also confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis.",
