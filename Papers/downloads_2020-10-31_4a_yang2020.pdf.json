The AgPt nanoparticles were characterized by applying the various method as ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The morphology structural indicated that the AgPt nanoparticles were spherical particles with diameter about 36.0 nm. The FTIR spectroscopy shows the efficient stabilization of the AgPt nanoparticles by phytoconstituents. The Ag and AgPt nanoparticles have polyphenolic content, lower than the flavonoids and proanthocyanins contents. The AgPt nanoparticles depicted the highest antioxidant properties compared to the Ag nanoparticles and ascorbic acid. The results showed that the AgPt nanoparticles had a high antioxidant properties. In addition, the AgPt nanoparticles demonstrated the substantial antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against pathogenic microbes and MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The environmental chemistry analysis depicts that methyl orange can be degraded from water by catalytic degradation process with sodium borohydride.

The deployment of noble metal nanoparticles in biological usage have the common therapy toward diseases or cancer [4,5]. The presence of dangerous chemicals for preparation and formation process have unsuitable effect in medical usage [6,7]. Thereupon, the green synthesis method have been investigated by using plants, microbes, agrowastes, pigments and enzyme for preparation of the noble metal nanoparticles [8,9].\nThe bimetallic nanoparticles has been ascribed to their hybrid performance to mix the attributes of two metals [10]. The bimetallic silver‑platinum have been widely studied in scientific reports due to the highest potential from Ag and Pt [11,12]. In the previous studies, the antioxidant/antimicrobial efficiency of Ag nano materials [13,14] and\nthe cytotoxic properties of Pt nano materials have been presented [15], and can be a good approach for disease treatment. Thereupon, there is a need to environmentally friendly method for preparation of Ag and Pt nano materials. Recently, the ethanolic extract of different plant were used for biosynthesis of bimetallic alloys nanoparticles [16]. Crocus sativus L. (saffron) is an important medicinal plant. Various biological activities such as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities have been attributed to extracts of Crocus sativus L. [17,18]. In previous studies showed different extract for synthesis mono or bimetallic nanoparticles. Elegbede and et al., presented the new synthesis with fungal xylanases for preparation of AgeAu bimetallic nanoparticle [19]. Adebayo and et al., showed the Persea Americana fruit peel extract was used for synthesis of Ag, Au, and AgAu nanoparticles [20].

Adebayo et al., evaluated the synthesis method of SilverGold Alloy Nanoparticles via Opuntia ficus-indica extract and used in antimicrobial and antioxidant activity [23]. Akintayo et al., studied on the synthesis animal fur-mediated silver nanoparticles for cytogenotoxicity activity [24].\nIn new studies, metal nano materials were presented as impressive catalysts for degradation of chemical compounds [25]. Ghosh et al., investigated the bimetallic AueAg nanoparticles are great and stable catalysts for degradation of different dye compounds [26]. In this research, the bimetallic AgPt nanoparticles were prepared by using the reducing potentials of Crocus sativus L extract via a simple method. In recent reports, the determination of metals in Crocus sativus L. was investigated. The results showed that the mineral elements were detected. The Crocus sativus are resources of calcium, potassium, iron manganese, magnesium and zinc were determined which that are needful for human health. Moreover, some of heavy metals were detected. The concentrations were the lowest, meet the national standards and safely for humans [27,28]. Therefore, there are not any heavy metal contamination from Crocus sativus L. plant. The AgPt nanoparticles from Crocus sativus L. extract was characterized by TEM, FTIR and UV–Visible spectral analysis. The prepared AgPt nanoparticles were examined for biological effects, and catalysis activities."

    "abstractText" : "In this project, silver‐platinum (AgPt) nanoparticles were prepared by using the Crocus sativus L. plant ethanolic extract. The AgPt nanoparticles were characterized by applying the various method as ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The morphology structural indicated that the AgPt nanoparticles were spherical particles with diameter about 36.0 nm. The FTIR spectroscopy shows the efficient stabilization of the AgPt nanoparticles by phytoconstituents. The Ag and AgPt nanoparticles have polyphenolic content, lower than the flavonoids and proanthocyanins contents. The AgPt nanoparticles depicted the highest antioxidant properties compared to the Ag nanoparticles and ascorbic acid. The results showed that the AgPt nanoparticles had a high antioxidant properties. In addition, the AgPt nanoparticles demonstrated the substantial antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against pathogenic microbes and MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The environmental chemistry analysis depicts that methyl orange can be degraded from water by catalytic degradation process with sodium borohydride. The AgPt nanoparticles were prosperous in catalytic degrading methyl orange following a first order kinetic model.",
