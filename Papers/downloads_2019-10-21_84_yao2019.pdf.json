      "text" : "Carbon dots (CDs) are a subclass of nanoparticles, defined by a quasi-spherical morphology and the characteristic size of <10 nm. CDs were first isolated from arc-discharge soot in 2004, and immediately attracted significant attention due to their photoluminescent properties (Figure 1A) [1]. Figure 1 highlights several major milestones from the course of CD development. In 2006, surface passivation was employed to enhance the photoluminescence of CDs by altering surface chemistry (Figure 1B) [2]. In 2010, crystalline CDs were successfully isolated, exhibiting size-dependent photoluminescence (Figure 1C) [3]. In 2013, amorphous CDs (polymer dots) were first prepared, expanding the CD material portfolio from graphite to include crosslinked-polymeric materials (Figure 1D) [4]. Today, CDs with well-defined chemical structure and morphology are being pursued. Recent examples include: (i) chiral CDs from chiral precursors (Figure 1E) [5–7]; (ii) 2D crystalline C3N of varying size (Figure 1F) [8]; and (iii) triangularly shaped CD-like nanoparticles with fewer defects that show unprecedented narrow-bandwidth photoluminescence (Figure 1G) [9]. Historically, CDs have exhibited highly desirable and tunable properties (e.g., upconversion photoluminescence and biocompatibility), rendering them promising candidates for wide applications in bioimaging, disease therapy, and optoelectronics [10–13].\nAlthough CDs have been explored extensively, quantitatively predicting their physiochemical properties remains a significant challenge because of their composite chemical structure. Some properties (e.g., toxicity) are dictated primarily by the CD core, whereas several properties (e.g., dispersibility) are derived from CD surface groups (Figure 2) [14,15]. Clearly, elucidating the factors contributing to the physiochemical behavior of CDs is critical to successful application. In this mini-review, we discuss strategies for controllable CD synthesis, as well as the origins and tunability of their physiochemical properties. Here, particular attention is given to structure–property relationships and discussion of bulk- versus surfacederived properties. Finally, we address the future of CD research with discussion of potential applications.\nTrends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2 10.1016/j.trechm.2019.02.003 235 © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

      "heading" : "Controllable CD Preparation",
      "text" : "Synthetic Methods Controllable preparation of CDs is critical to scientific study and application development, which can be realized through careful choice of synthetic method. Currently, CDs can be prepared by two potential approaches: bottom-up and top-down. The former utilizes organic monomer/polymer precursors, whereas the latter employs carbon materials such as graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Figure 3A) [1,3,16,17].\nCarbohydrates, organic acids, and polymers have been widely explored in the bottom-up approach as precursors to synthesize CDs through the partial dehydration and dehydrogenation assisted by microwaves, solvothermal reaction, or thermal decomposition [5,18,19]. Often, the requisite harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature and pressure) result in multistep organic reactions and varied intermediates that severely complicate the formation mechanism. Key factors affecting the CDs chemical structure and size have been studied extensively, including reaction precursors type, reaction time, solvent, and temperature [18,20–22]. The selected reaction conditions are critical because they have strong effects on the underlying highly stochastic nucleation and growth processes [23]. For example, reaction temperature and time can dictate the size and crystallinity of CDs prepared by pyrolysis [24]. At low concentration, sulfuric acid has been shown to promote carbonization; however, increasing\n236 Trends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2\nSurfaceCore\nDispersibility\nPhotostability\nPhotoluminescence\nElectroluminescencePhoto-inducedelectron transfer\nElectron mediator\nToxicity\n(A)\nProperty\nSurfaceCore\nDrug delivery\nMass spectrometry\nGene regula on\nEnzyme regula on\nLight-emi ng diodes\nBioimaging\nThermal therapy\n(B)\nApplica on\nOrganocatalysis\nElectrocatalysis\nFigure 2.

Note that relative core/surface contributions are not to scale.\nconcentration eventually results in CD etching [23]. Thus, the CD size and composition can be controlled through the careful optimization of reaction parameters.\nIn the top-down approach, carbon materials such as CNTs, graphite, and soot are ‘cut’ into CDs via arc-discharge, laser ablation, or chemical oxidation [2,17,25]. In particular, electrochemical oxidation of CNTs or graphite has been heavily explored because of the facile manipulation and mild experimental conditions required (e.g., no toxic gas exhausted) [17,26]. The electrochemical preparation of CDs is controlled primarily by the electrolyte and operating parameters. For example, CDs can also be prepared through electrochemical oxidations of graphite rods in a water/ionic liquid electrolyte [26]. In this system, the electrolyte water content affects the operating voltage, because it alters the overpotential of oxidizing water to form intermediates (hydroxyl or oxygen radicals) for graphite oxidation [26]. CDs were also successfully obtained in ionic-liquid-free electrolytes by adjusting operating condition such as electrolyte pH, using phosphate buffer solution or pure water for improved convenience and/or economy [25,27].\nThese synthetic strategies have been widely adopted because of their convenience, high efficiency, and large-scale production capability. However, these methods commonly involve multistep reactions and complex mechanisms that are unsuitable for preparation of CDs with\nTrends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2 237\n(A) (B)\n(D)\n(F) (G) m/z = 4812\n1000 3000 5000\n(C)\n(E)\nGraphite CNT\nOr\nOr\nPolymersSmall molecules\nTop-down\nHydrothermal\nSolvothermal\nTotal synthesis\nBo om-up\nIn te\nns ity\nm/z\n4805 4820 4805 4810 4815 4820\nFigure 3.

In several cases, well-crystalline CDs with homogenous structure have also been prepared through solvothermal or hydrothermal reactions. For example, C3N CDs with D6h-symmetry were successfully synthesized through horizontal and vertical polymerization of 2,3-diaminophenazine under hydrothermal conditions (Figure 3B,C) [8]. Recently, triangularly shaped CD-like nanoparticles with narrow size distributions were synthesized from the organic precursor phloroglucinol. Here, uniform chemical structure and size were shown indirectly by their ultra-narrow bandwidth photoluminescence (Figure 3D,E) [9]. Chemical total synthesis was also recently employed to successfully prepare CDs with well-defined structure composed of conjugated cores containing 132, 168, or 170 carbon atoms and alkyl edges as the stabilization moieties (Figure 3F,G) [28].\nFollowing synthesis, unreacted reactants and by-products are commonly removed by dialysis, filtration, and/or centrifugation [8,29]. For example, CD solutions obtained from hydrothermal treatment of selenocystine were purified by centrifugation to remove large particles and dialysis to remove small organic and inorganic salts [30]. In general, purified CDs can be then used directedly for further characterization and/or application. However, in some cases, fractionation is required because of the severe inhomogeneity in size, conjugated domains, surface defects, and/or functional groups [31]. To remedy this issue, gel electrophoresis, ion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase chromatography have been employed to separate CDs based on differences in polarity and surface chemistry [1,32–38]. However, size distribution is also a critical variable [3]. In several cases, gel-filtration chromatography has been successfully employed to separate CDs based on size (average size: 2.47 0.84 nm) into three\n238 Trends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2\nfractions with ultra-narrow size distributions (average size: 2.65 0.48, 2.01 0.57 and 1.24 0.43, respectively) [39].\nPostsynthetic Modifications The resulting chemical structure of CDs can be modified further to regulate the resulting properties. Commonly, two strategies have been employed: heteroatom doping and surface modification.\nHeteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, boron, and sulfur) can be facilely incorporated into CDs by utilizing heteroatom-containing reactants. For example, water soluble nitrogen- or seleniumdoped CDs have been prepared from the reactants comprising nitrogen or selenium groups [19,30]. CDs can also be co-doped by more than one type of heteroatom type, such as nitrogen-sulfur-doped CDs prepared through hydrothermal treatment of cysteine [21]. Although heteroatom doping is a facile method for CD modification, the resulting CD chemical structure is commonly unclear because of complicated reaction mechanism, severely limiting the rational structural design. Controlled doping with well-defined molecular structures must be further developed.\nConversely, surface functionalization via well-established organic reactions is more controllable. CD functional groups can be selectively formed, eliminated, or converted. For example, hydroxy groups have been converted into trifluoroacetate groups by esterification with trifluoroacetic anhydride [40], and carboxylic acid/ketone groups have been transformed into hydroxamic acid/oximes groups after treatment with hydroxylamine [40]. CDs can also be decorated with molecules or oligomeric polymers through specific or non-specific interaction. CDs have been covalently modified through condensation reactions between carbonyl and amino groups by several aromatic molecules, including o-phenylenediamine, 2,3-diaminonaphthalene, and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene [41]. These polyaromatic molecules alter the conjugated domain of CDs so as to rationally regulate the resulting band gap. CDs have also been ‘passivated’ by oligomeric polymers (e.g., oligomeric PEG, molecular weight 1500) to improve photoluminescence [2]. Importantly, the decorated CDs have a similar characteristic size as the pristine CDs due to the low molecular weight and small gyration radius of the polymer [2]."

      "text" : "CDs exhibited severe complexity in their resulting physicochemical properties due to their diversified size, degree of crystallinity, and chemical structure. Therefore, careful understanding of the underlying structure–property relationship is necessary (Figure 4). Below, we discuss several key CD properties.\nDispersibility Dispersibility is a fundamental prerequisite for CD solution-processing and application. This property, however, depends strongly on CD surface chemistry. Most CDs are hydrophilic with a good solubility, because of the oxygen-containing functional groups derived from precursors or generated during synthesis [42]. However, hydrophobic CDs have been prepared through partial carbonization of hydrophobic precursors and surface modification by hydrophobic molecules. For example, hydrophobic CDs prepared through carbonization of the octadecyl ammonium (C18H37NH\n+) citrate salt in air dispersed well in organic solvents (e.g., toluene, chloroform, and hexane) at a high concentration of 50 mg ml 1 [10]. Recently, it was demonstrated that hydrophilic CDs can be made hydrophobic following covalent attachment of dodecylamine, as revealed by the spontaneous transferring of CDs from water into a toluene phase (Figure 4A) [43].\nTrends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2 239\n(A)\n(C) (D)\n(F) (G)\n(E)\n(B)\nHydrophilic Hydrophilic\nWavelength (nm) 400 600\n3.5\n2.5 hυ (e\nV)\n1.5\nSize (nm) 1 2 3 4\n800\nWavelength (nm) 400 600500\nn Light\nEnlarging π-domain\nLaser\nDark\nBandgap narrowing\nHydrophobic Hydrophobic\nN2, 60 °C\nCO2C12H25NH2\nπ*\nπ\nToluene Toluene\nWater Water\nFigure 4.

For example, hydrophilic CDs have been used as fluorescent probe to image tumors, whereas hydrophobic CDs have been used as catalysts in several organic reactions [44–46]. Recently, reversible wettability control via environmental stimuli has been demonstrated, extending the potential application of CDs. In this case, hydrophobic amine-terminated CDs were prepared by pyrolyzing a mixture of citric acid and amines in 1-octanol. The CDs then reversibly transferred between water and 1-octanol by alternating bubbling and removal of CO2, on the basis of the reversible reaction between CO2 and amine groups to form/hydrolyze hydrophilic ammonium salt (Figure 4B) [46].\nUltraviolet-Visible Absorbance Although CDs have highly varied chemical structures, most share a similar UV–vis absorbance spectrum, with a strong absorption band that decays from the UV to vis region (Figure 4C) [22,29,47,48]. The absorbance is ascribed to the p–p* transitions of conjugated electron and n–p* transitions from oxygen atom or heteroatom, and the curve shape and intensities can be regulated through heteroatom doping or surface modification [22,47].\nSome CDs are susceptible to transformation or are unstable upon light irradiation, which can be employed to fabricate light-responsive materials. For example, CDs have recently been used as\n240 Trends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2\nlight-controlled catalysts because of their reversible transformations of phenolic hydroxyl and unsaturated ketone groups in the dark/light (Figure 4D) [49]. In addition, hydroxy-rich CDs have shown to be an ideal matrix for analyzing small molecules via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry because they dissociate hydroxy anion/radical without releasing carbon fragments (Figure 4E) [50].\nPhotoluminescence Significant effort has been expended towards manipulating the photoluminescent properties of CDs due to potential applications in bioimaging and biosensing. Owing to their structural diversity, CDs exhibited varied and tunable photoluminescence such as up-conversion photoluminescence, phosphorescence, solid-state fluorescence, and piezo-chromic fluorescence [11,51–56]. Controlling these properties remains a significant challenge, however, because they are strongly affected by both surface and bulk properties. Most CDs exhibit excitationdependent photoluminescence, with strong emission in the blue-wavelength region that decays rapidly in the red-wavelength region [2].\nRecently, enhanced red-shifted emission has been demonstrated by manipulating either CD size or chemistry. For CDs with well-defined crystalline cores, photoluminescence often depends strongly on the size because of the quantum size effect, where increasing size leads to red-shifted photoluminescence as the result from the narrowing bandgap between highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (Figure 4F) [3,11]. As discussed above, the CD size and conjugation can be controlled via synthesis conditions, surface modification, or fractionation [11,57]. For example, CDs prepared through hydrothermal reaction have an increased average characteristic size (from 3.67 to 5.74 nm) by controlling HNO3 concentration in the reaction solution and exhibited a red-shifted fluorescence [57]. Similarly, CDs enlarged through conjugation of polyaromatic compounds (e.g., o-phenylenediamine) exhibited a narrower band gap, and thus a higher red-shifted emission (Figure 4G) [41].\nIn many cases, the quantum size effect is not observed because of interference by surface defects such as functional groups or heteroatoms. Here, surface defects act as radiative or nonradiative recombination centers of excited electrons and holes, thereby effecting photoluminescence [41,58]. However, the nature of defects or functional groups and how exactly they contribute the red-shifted emission is still relatively unknown. Recently, nitrogen doping and hydroxy, epoxy, and carbonyl groups have all been shown to affect the red-shifted emission of CDs; however, there is no detailed systematic study on the underlying mechanisms [18,22,34,47,48,59–63]. Generally, surface functionalization is a more reliable method for rationally tuning the photoluminescence of CDs. For example, CDs bonded by nitrogencontaining groups via nucleophilic substitution and dehydration reactions have demonstrated tunable band gap ranging from 1.30 to 2.23 eV, and consequently, tunable photoluminescence from blue to red emission due to orbital resonance of nitrogen moieties with the CDs [64].\nPhotoexcited Charge Separation and Electron Medium CDs are excellent electron acceptors and electron donors with applications as photocatalysts for organic pollution degradation, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction [65–67]. Upon light irradiation, electrons and holes can be generated within CD materials and then transferred to other species, as revealed by the decayed photoluminescence of CDs combined with electrondonating or electron-accepting molecules [3,68,69].\nCD photocatalytic performance is dictated by band structure and interfacial interaction, which are optimized by tuning size, heteroatom-doping level, and functional-group type [70,71]. For\nTrends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2 241\nexample, band gap may be tuned through size or by introducing heteroatom, as discussed above. However, precise control of the band position remains a significant challenge because of complexities in CD chemical structure. Nitrogen doping has been reported to decrease the CD work functions [72]. Hydrogen bond at the CD surface has been shown to bend the energy band upward, facilitating photoexcited electron transfer in favor of photocatalytic performance [73]. Specially, nitrogen-doped CDs with oxygen-containing functional groups were successfully prepared as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light, in which a delicate p-n junction was formed by nitrogen-doped cores (as the n-domain) and oxidative edges (as the p-type domain) (Figure 5A) [70].\nCDs have also been combined with other semiconductor materials (e.g., TiO2 or ZnS) for improved photocatalytic performance. For example, CDs can act as photosensitizers to capture solar energy through the electron or energy transfer mechanisms, or as electron media for facilitating electron–hole separation [74–76]. In these cases, interfacial interactions, such as covalent and hydrogen bonding, are essential because of the strong effects on charge separation and carrier concentration. For example, covalently bonded CDs/TiO2 composites showed higher performance of photocatalytic water splitting than their physical blend [77]. In another example, CDs/C3N4 photocatalysts showed an extremely high efficiency in overall water splitting under visible light, primarily due to synergy between C3N4 (splitting water into H2 and H2O2) and the CD (decomposing the H2O2 into H2O and O2) (Figure 5B) [78].\nCytotoxicity, Biocompatibility, and Biological Activity Low CD toxicity is critical to successful biological application. Most CDs exhibit low toxicity at low concentrations (e.g., 10 mg/ml), which is primarily derived from the bulk, and at that size, either degrade or are directly removed by the excretory system [79]. However, increasing concentration potentially enhances toxicity for cells, impairing organ development [80]. In some cases, CD toxicity increases significantly in the presence of an external stimulus. For example, CDs prepared through hydrothermal treatment of graphite are nontoxic in the absence of light, but exhibit phototoxicity due to production of reactive oxygen species under light irradiation [81]. Here, the reaction-oxygen-species formation could be suppressed by surface chemistry modification [82].\nIn recent years, CDs have been successfully designed for cancer targeting, drug delivery, and antibiosis, and have also been employed to tune enzyme activity, cell-membrane permeability, and gene expression [83–87]. CDs with tailored functional groups have been employed as photoluminescent probes of cancer cells and bacterium. For example, folate functionalized CDs have detected cancer cells that overexpressed surface folic receptors (Figure 5C) [83]. CDs also have been shown to complex with anticancer drugs via chemical or intramolecular interactions to realize drug delivery with high loading for improved therapy [88]. In addition, some CDs showed antibacterial activity due to disintegration of the bacterial membrane or formation of reactive oxygen species [84,89]. For example, cationic CDs prepared through pyrolysis of spermidine showed effective antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus through disruption of the bacterial membrane, which were demonstrated to have good efficacy in the treatment of S. aureus-induced keratitis in rabbits (Figure 5D) [89].\nBecause of their ability to both donate and accept electrons, CDs have been developed to tune the catalytic activity of enzymes, including laccase and porcine pancreatic lipase [90,91]. After being combined with phosphate functionalized CDs, laccase activity increased by 47% in dark conditions owing to the enhanced substrate-binding capacity, and increased by 92% under\n242 Trends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2\n(A) (B)\n(C)\n(D)\n(E)\nAutophagy\nCorneal epithelial cells\nCorneal stroma\nStaphylococcus aureus\nAutophagy inhibi on\nCDs\nTight junc on Tight junc on opening\nCellular apoptosis\nFolatefunc onalized CD\nChloroquine\nRoot elonga onSeed germina on Disease resistance\nDNA\nSeed\np-type n-type\nLoose DNA\nYield: +14.7%\nFigure 5.

Furthermore, CDs have also been developed to boost the growth of rice plants due to three advantages: (i) accelerating seed germination and root elongation by increasing the water absorption capacity of plant seeds as a result of their various hydrophilic functional groups; (ii) improving plant disease-resistance by enhancing thionin (Os06g32600) gene expression through intercalation into the DNA grooves; and (iii) promoting plant growth via degradation into plant hormone analogues (Figure 5E) [92].\nTrends in Chemistry, May 2019, Vol. 1, No. 2 243\nOutstanding Questions Can CD chemical structure be systematically investigated, designed, and controlled?\nWhat is the molecular mechanism/ controlling relationship of CD photoluminescence?\nCan CDs be widely used as light-emitting diodes?\nHow can we quantitatively study the electron-transfer kinetics of CDs?\nAre CDs biocompatible for use in humans?

      "text" : "Although CDs have been explored extensively, detailed molecular understanding of their properties remains elusive. For example, most CDs have low toxicity, but several CDs are highly toxic [81]. Several CDs exhibit strong photocurrent upon light irradiation, but CDs exhibiting weak photocurrent have also been observed [93]. Such contrasting properties are derived from the highly varied, composite structure of CDs. This idea is potentially unsatisfying to researchers; however, this is also part of the charm that attracts us because it implies an ‘infinite’ number of possibilities for the tunability of CDs.\nAs discussed above, CDs usually possess a graphite core decorated with various functional groups on the surface. Because of their small size (and high aspect ratio), the combined effect of the bulk material and surface groups makes understanding the origins of CD properties extremely difficult. CDs can be considered as a superposition of bulk and surface states, combined in various proportions. Most properties (e.g., photoluminescence and photogenerated electron transfer) are influenced by both the bulk and surface groups, while several properties (e.g., dispersibility and toxicity) are primarily derived from either the bulk or surface groups [23]. Accordingly, CDs successfully combine a graphite core with potentially directed surface chemistry, endowing us great freedom to manipulate their physicochemical properties for further application."

Although CDs have been studied extensively, there are still several significant challenges (see Outstanding Questions), including controlling and quantifying CD chemical structures, as well as quantitative analysis of structure–property relationships."

    "abstractText" : "*Correspondence: zhkang@suda.edu.cn (Z. Kang). Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging subset of nanomaterials, defined by characteristic sizes of <10 nm. CDs possess a carbon core that is functionalized by various groups at the surface. These materials exhibit a wide range of physiochemical properties (e.g., photo-induced electron transfer and photoluminescence) making them an ideal platform for several important environmental, biological, and energy-related applications. However, elucidating the molecular origin and key factors controlling their varied physiochemical properties remains an outstanding challenge. Some properties (e.g., toxicity) are dictated primarily by the CD core, while other properties (e.g., dispersibility) are derived primarily from surface functional groups. This mini-review highlights the recent advances in CDs, with particular attention given to controllable syntheses method, bulkversus surface-derived physiochemical properties, and key structure–property relationships.",
