Developing accurate and effective techniques to the early stage diagnosis of cancer are very vital to start the treatment process. Targeted detection of the cancerous cell is the most reliable approach to the identification of cancer solid tumors. Folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed on the membrane of many types of cancers and is a fascinating molecule for targeting cancer because of the high affinity between FR and folic acid (FA) (Kd z 10 pM). Such fact was extremely utilized to develop the imaging of solid tumors and targeted delivery of drugs. This review discusses the critical role of FRs for the quantitative recognition of cancer cells. In this regard, the applied advanced materials in the designing of the FR-based cytosensors and the state-of-art of the cytosensing devices were discussed that may be have possible uses as a device in the clinical diagnosis of various cancers. Also, the analytical performances and the favorable features of the reported methods were explored. The present review covers the reported FR-based methods for the detection of cancer cells from 2010 to 2019 and will be a useful reference for the future works. Moreover, the applications of FR-based strategy in cancer cells imaging were also discussed.\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Cancer is an abnormal cell growth that could then spread neighboring organs or tissues. Despite advances in cancer detection devices, cancer remains the second main cause of mortality around the world. According to World Health Organization (WHO) reports, in 2007, 7.9 and in 2018, 9.6 million people passed away from cancer and it is estimated that this numberwill increase to 12million deaths in 2030. The cost of cancer diagnosis and therapywas US$1.16 trillion in 2010 [1]. In men, lung, stomach, prostate, liver and colorectal are the most frequent cancers, however, in women, breast, colorectal, lung, cervix and thyroid are the common cancers.\nEarly stage detection of cancers is the substantial problem in cancer therapy and about 30e50% of cancers could be prevented by control of risk factors and doing of some evidence-based tactics [1].\n, hasanzadehm@tbzmed.ac.ir urmi.ac.ir (N. shadjou).\nAfter the diagnosis of cancer, controlling of the cancer is very crucial which is deeply dependent on the clinical test results and the doctors’ prescriptions. Conventionally, different techniques have been established for the detection of cancers including photon emission computed tomography (PECT) [2], immunohistochemistry [3,4], polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [5], single-positron emission tomography (SPET) [6], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [7] and flow cytometry [8]. Currently, these techniques are broadly employed in cancer detection. However, most of these techniques suffer from some limitations such as high cost, long time of analysis, false-positive/negative results, low-sensitivity and also usually provide qualitative results [9,10].\nDue to the aforementioned disadvantages of the currently used techniques, fabrication of the new analytical methods with simple, low-cost, rapid, accurate and specific features are of great importance in clinical diagnosis of cancer, providing the diagnosis of cancer even without referring to the clinics. Currently, main analytical methods for the detection of tumor cells are electrochemical [11e13], optical [14] and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) [15] based sensors. These techniques were applied with different strategies such as\nlabeled/label free, antigen/antibody conjugation, DNA complementary segments, protein conjugates and membrane receptors to develop aptamers, immunosensors, enzyme and other molecule/ biomolecule based biosensors. However, the target specific approaches are considered as ideal methods for sensors’ construction which mainly provided with antigen/antibody interactions, DNA complementary segments, protein conjugates (streptavidin/biotin) and membrane receptors [16]. One of the targeted cell sensing method is using the folate receptor (FR) and folic acid (FA) interactions. FRs, alpha and beta, are overexpressed on the membrane of themost of the cancer cells (not normal cells) [17,18]. FAmolecules are uptake by cells using various transportation systems including FRs, reduced folate carrier (RFC) and proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) [17]. Currently, monoclonal antibodies and FA binding are used for the detection of FR-positive cells. FR is a fascinating agent for various medical targeted therapy [19e22] and imaging [23e27] of cancer cells because of the high affinity between FR and FA with dissociation constant (Kd) of about 0.1e1 nM. FR based sensing methods possess some prominent advantages over other targeted methods; 1) the functionalization of the materials with FA for sensitization to FRs is simple and low-cost; 2) the synthesized materials could be stored at room temperature or refrigerator without any severe care conditions and 3) the primary materials to\nScheme 1. General mechanism of action o\nconstruct the cytosensing probe are purely accessible. Therefore, not only construction of FR based cytosensors is facile but also provide protocols with high sensitivity and specificity towards the detection of different cancer cells.\nTo date, different review papers were published to explain the applications of FR in targeted drug delivery [28e30], gene delivery [31], imaging [32e34] and diagnosis [35]. However, the quantitative sensing of the cancer cells using FR was not reported yet. The general mechanism of action of the FR/FA interactions for various aims is represented in Scheme 1. This review is intended to report the FR-based detection of cancer cells published from 2010 to 2019. In this review, we emphasis on the recent advancements in FR-based cytosensing of the FR-overexpressed tumoral cancer cells to show their possibilities and advantages. This reviewwas categorized under five main sections based on the advanced materials used to the fabrication of the cytosensor including gold nanoparticles, carbon, magnetic and porous, polymers and other types of materials for the detection cancer cells. Analytical figures of merit and some important features of the reported approaches are collected in Table 1. Each section reports the details of the construction of the cytosensors and evaluates the advantages and analytical figures of merit of the reported cytosensors.\nf FR/FA interactions for various aims.\nTable 1 Figures of merit of the reported cytosensors.\nMethod Material Cell Type Type of cancer Linear range/cells mL 1 LOD/cells mL 1 Ref.\nDPV AuNPs HL-60 Leukemia 500e7.5 107 30e300\n350 Su et al.

      "heading" : "2.1.1. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) based cytosensors",
      "text" : "AuNPs are regarded as one of the most preferred nanoparticles for the developments of sensing probes because of their superior physico-chemical properties [39]. These properties lead to the construction of sensitive, stable and biocompatible biosensors. In this section, advances in applications of AuNPs in FA/FR based cytosensing were presented to provide a brief of the reported strategies for the detection of FR-overexpressed cancer cells.\n2.1.1.1. Electrochemical. The conjugation of aptamers on AuNPs surfaces is mainly carried out by physical adsorption or chemisorption of sulfur atoms by in situ synthesis [40]. Su et al. [41] reported a paper based aptamer for the detection of human acute promyelocytic leukemia cancer cells (HL-60). The fabricated electrochemical cell sensor provides an in situ and microfluidic approach for the recognition of blood cancer cells. At first, the cellulose fibers were covered with AuNPs and then KH1C12 aptamer attached on their surfaces. The constructed gold paper based electrode showed high throughput capture of cancer cells with favorable biocompatibility which provides wide dynamic range from 500 to 7.5 107 cells/mL. The 3D porous structure of\nthis cytosensor enhanced its sensitivity. As reported, the developed sensor was successfully implemented towards the monitoring drug induced apoptosis of cancer cells. The fast preparing and costeffective procedure of the developed sensor are two main advantages of the reported method which are requiring for designing of sensing devices.\nGe and coworkers [42] utilized the intrinsic peroxidation activity of a trimetallic dendritic nanoparticles (Au@PdPtNPs) to sense the K-562 leukemia cancer cells. To produce Au@PtPdNPs, Au NPs (as seeding agent) were mixed with H2PtCl4 and H2PdCl4 solutions. After that, N3C11H22SH molecules were attached to introduce azide terminal on the surface of Au@PtPd NPs to the subsequently attachment of FA molecules. In the presence of thionine, Au@PdPt NPs reduce the peroxide molecules to amplify the produced electrochemical current. The Au@PdPt NPs were functionalized with FA (by click-chemistry approach) and then attached on the surface of the paper based device. Two steps of FA functionalization were utilized to increase the selectivity of the sensor where the surface of the electrode was functionalized with alkyneFA molecules and then with the produced nanoparticles. The proposed nonenzymatic cytosensor displayed excellent figures of merit with wide dynamic range from 1.0 10 2 to 2.0 10 7 cells/ mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 31 cells/mL which could be a favorable candidate for point-of-care (POC) medical diagnosis.\nPang and his colleagues [43] applied the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) approach to the functionalization of the gold electrode whereas the copper ions were applied as catalyzer of the reaction. Click chemistry was applied to the further functionalization of the Au surface which provides superior properties such as chemoselectivity compared to other coupling reactions. Au electrodes were functionalized with azidoundecanethiol (N3(CH2)11SH)\nto form azide-SAM layers. After that, the electrodes were immersed in propargyl folate aqueous solution to produce final FAfunctionalized layers on the gold electrodes. The proposed platform was tested by Leukemia K562 cells as model and showed potential for biosensing of cancer cells. Besides the advantages of the developed cytosensor, this method suffers from the difficulty in cytosensor designing.\nThe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique records the impedance of a system under a voltage. A noninvasive EIS based method was proposed to the sensing of HeLa cancer cells ranging from 6 to 1 103 and 1 103 to 1 105 cells/mLwith a LOD of 6 cells/mL. Firstly, 1,6-hexanedithiol was used to create a SAM layer to passivate the electrode surface and then effectively reduces the charge transfer. Secondly, AuNPs were utilized to improve the electroactivity of GCE electrode to the adsorption of the 11- mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) molecules. Finally, FA molecules were attached to the MUA ends by EDC/NHS reaction. The longchained MUA molecules caused a resistance to the penetration of the ions, and therefore, increase the sensor selectivity [44]. The report method possesses some exceptional advantages of simplicity, selectivity and ultra-sensitivity which are the main requirements for the construction of sensors.\nWeng et al. [45] developed another EIS method to detect FR overexpressed cancer cells. The surface of the probe was improved with FA-assembled AuNPs which was physically deposited on the boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode surface. In brief, AuNPs were deposited on the BDD modified electrode by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Next, MUA molecules were utilized as linker to covalently conjugation of FA molecules to create BDD/Au/MUA/FA modified electrode. Results showed that the FA modified BDD electrode can noticeably attach to the FR-rich HeLa cancer cells. The signal of the developed EIS-based cytosensor is linear range from10 to 105 cells/mL with a LOD of 10 cells/mL. Fig. 1 represents the BDD working electrode surface modification steps. The BDD electrodes show some unique electrochemical properties including low background currents, wide potential window, excellent stability and biocompatibility.\nZhang et al. [46] constructed an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) cytosensor to quantify HeLa cancer cells. Firstly, the NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles were produced and modified by AuNPs. Secondly, NaYF4:Yb,Er/AuNPswere anchored on the surface of GCE electrodes by (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) molecules. Finally, FA molecules were attached by a simple EDC/NHS reaction. After modification with AuNPs, the ECL signal was increased about 4- orders of magnitude. As a mechanism of action, HeLa cancer cells were anchoredon the surface of themodifiedGCEelectrode through\nFA and FRs interactions. The signal of NaYF4:Yb,Er/AuNPs/FA based cytosensor was linear from 4.25 102 to 4.25 105 cells/mL with a LOD of 326 cells/mL. The fabricated NaYF4:Yb,Er/AuNPs/FA electrochemical cytosensor showed someadvantages of high sensitivity, high stability, fast and simple method for various FRs-positive cancer cell detection and showed a great potential for biomedical analysis.\nAlso, Soleymani et al. [47] utilized cysteamine (CA) and FA to functionalize AuNPs by an on-pot synthesis to produce an AuNPs/ CA/FA based cytosensor for the specific detection of target FRoverexpressed cancer cells. To synthesis the cytosensor, firstly AuNPs were produced on the gold electrode by an in situ electrochemical method and then CA molecules attached to the AuNPs by their thiol groups and finally FA molecules were covalently bonded to the amine groups of the CA molecules by EDC/NHS reaction. The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique was utilized to monitor the effect of HT 29 cells on the fabricate electrode where the linear rage was from 250 to 5000 cell/mL with lower limit of detection (LLOQ) of 250 cells/mL. As an advantage of the probe not only could sense the FR-positive HT 29 cells but also improves the selectivity of the cytosensor for attachment to the membrane of cancer cells. Another advantages of this probe are simplicity, costeffectiveness and reproducibility of the developed sensing probe.\nFrom this section, it is concluded that different types of electrochemical techniques and synthesis approaches were applied for developing of probes for the detection FR-positive cancer cells. Basically, all reported studies utilized electrochemical technique but each method determines different parameter of FR/FA interactions. For examples, DPV records current while EIS records resistances towards electron transferring between electrolyte and modified electrode (as sensing probe). However, ECL based probes measure electrochemical-induced emitted lights. Besides the sensitivity of the reported sensors, the DPV based sensors are more simple and selective approaches.\n2.1.1.2. Optical. Recently, Resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) based techniques have been employed to label free detection of biomolecules [48,49]. RRS based sensors show some benefits including simple, rapid and low-cost procedure with high sensitivity which RRS signal could be measured by a fluorometer. Cai et al. [50] fabricated a novel RRS based probe to determine and differentiate the MCF 7 breast cancer cells from normal and HepG2 (FR-negative) cancer cells. The FA functionalized gold nanoparticles (FA-AuNPs) were used as a sensing probe where the cystamine was used as a linker between AuNPs and FA molecules. Cystamine provides two primary-amine groups for further functionalization of\nthe AuNPs surface which could be caused to higher binding capacity of the AuNPs. The main advantages of the reported method are simplicity, rapidness and sensitivity of method with a LOD of lower than 12 cell/mL.\nDistinguishing normal and cancer cells is the main subject in the specific cancer diagnosis. Fasolato et al. [51] reported a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based method to the screening three types HeLa, PC-3 and HaCaT cancer cells. After synthesis of AuNPs, they functionalized with 4-aminothiophenol (4ATP) via SeAu bond. Afterwards, FA molecules were activated and attached to the AuNPs-4ATP particles by EDC/NHS reaction. The proposed biosensor was able to distinguish cancer cells based on the amount of the overexpressed FRs (Fig. 2). The main advantage of the developed cytosensor is that the sensing process could be occurred in physiological conditionwhich reduces the cell apoptosis during cell sensing.\nChen et al. [52] applied dual-targeted surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) based approach for the detection of MCF 7 tumoral cells. For this aim, MUC1 aptamer was attached on the surface of gold electrode by AueS bonds. After that, FA molecules were decorated on the surface of the magnetic nanomaterials to the specific conjugation with cancer cells. The signal of sandwich type SPR device was proportional with the number of cancer cells from 5 102 to 1 104 cells/mLwith a LOD of 5 102 cells/mL. Themain reason for the increasement of the sensitivity of the probe is the higher refractive index (RI) of the FA-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles. In the construction of this cytosensor, a dual marker strategy was used as recognition system which can enhance both selectivity and sensitivity of the probe.\n2.1.1.3. QCM. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is an acoustic method which measures the factor of energy dissipation and resonance frequency after applies an acoustic pulse. Interestingly, QCM-D method was applied to determine the MCF 7 breast cancer cells. In this report, a FAmodified bacterial surface layer (SbpA) protein was attached on the surface of gold substrate to construct an electrochemical biosensor [53]. For this aim, S-layer proteins were isolated from lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM 2177 and functionalized with FA by EDC/NHS reaction. The reported method provides a real time and label-free approach for in situ biosensing of the FR-positive cancer cells. Despite the novelty of the reported QCM based method, the sensitivity of the method is not satisfying where the reported LOD was about 105 cells/mL.\nZhou et al. [54] reported a QCM based cytosensor for the detection of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. They used AuNPs as main substrate which subsequently modified by L-cysteine and FA molecules. The sensing platform was fabricated by functionalization of the surface of a gold (Au) disk by mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) and poly-L-lysine (PLL) (Au/MFA/PLL). Upon addition of FR-positive cancer cells and then AuNPs/L-cysteine/FA to the Au/MFA/PLL substrate, a change on the resonance frequency was observed and recorded by a QCM instrument. The detection of MDA-MB-231 cells was linear from 3.0 104 to 1.0 106 cells/mL and a LOD of about 5.0 103 cells/mL. As an advantage, this method offers a new type of cytosensor which could be designed as a flow-injected device for continuous monitoring of various types of cancer cells. However, its LOD is not satisfied for ultra-sensitive detections.\nThe above reported methods are showing the importance of the AuNPs as a signal transducer in the cytosensing of FR-positive cancer cells. Various strategies i.e. SPR, SERS, EIS, etc., were utilized to the cytosensing of the cancer cells, approving the crucial role of the AuNPs in cancer cells detection. SPR and SERS techniques provide label-free and non-invasive approaches to the sensitive cytosensing which are mainly based on the various types of AuNPs. The relatively high absorption coefficient of the AuNPs, together with the well-known and easy synthesis methods of AuNPs make them as promising materials for sensitive targeted detection of different cancers. Also, the biocompatibility and favorable stability of the AuNPs are other advantages that encouraging the use of AuNPs to fabricate the sensing probes. Moreover, the surface properties of AuNPs could easily be improved by various groups. For example, the aptamer molecules were anchored to the surface of the AuNPs by a simple oriented “click chemistry” reaction [55].\nAlso, AuNPs-based materials collaborate with various techniques such as electrochemical, optical and QCM, to produce sensors for the detection of various types of cancer cells. However, the electrochemical based methods are in majorities which are initiated from the facility and diversity in the fabrications of the electrochemical based probes. Generally, electroactive materials are more available than QCM, fluorescence and SPR active materials and usually UV based approaches are not provided favorable sensitivities (our experiences). Despite wide range applications QCM-based sensors, the robustness of these types of sensors is not favorable in comparison with the other available technologies [56]. However, the SPR based sensors provide the facility to detect real-time and in situ determination of analytes with measuring of the changes in refractive index values near the sensing site. It is predicted that the future studies will more focus on the developing of QCM and SPR based sensors for the detection of cancer cells."

      "text" : "Porous materials show large specific surface area and high pore volume which pore size of the cavities is very important for the designing of more sensitive sensors [57]. To enhance properties of porous materials based biosensors, considerations have been focused on the combined materials to exploit the synergistic effect. In the following, we will discuss the combined porous materials in cytosensing.\n2.1.2.1. Electrochemical. Fibrous nano-silica (KCC-1) has several outstanding properties for various aims. For example, these materials show high stability and it is easy to functionalize their surfaces to the desired conditions [58]. In addition, KCC-1 based materials have high surface area to volume ratio and simple storage conditions [59]. Soleymani et al. [60] reported a KCC-1 based cytosensor to the sensitive and selective detection of HT 29 cancer cells. Firstly, KCC-1 nanocomposite was produced using a hydrothermal approach and then KCC-1-NH2-FA nanoparticles were synthesized by EDC/NHS chemistry reaction. After that, to fabricate the cytosensor, KCC-1-NH2-FA nanoparticles were attached on the surface of GCE electrode by an electrochemical method. The signal of the constructed cytosensor was linear from 50 to 1.2 104 cells/mL with a LLOQ of 50 cells/mL. This cytosensor provides some advantages of high sensitivity, specificity and stability. In addition, it shows repeatable results with simple probe preparation steps. Mechanism of action of the probe is presented in Fig. 3.\n2.1.2.2. Optical. Colorimetric based sensing is a convenient method for the detection of macrostructures and molecules, offering even naked eye detection for low concentrations of analytes. The colorimetric methods are well-established approaches for designing of the POC based devices. Ge et al. [61] established a novel colorimetric method utilizing FR/FA integration to the rapid sensing of the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) cancer cells.\nBimetallic porous Pd@AuNPs show a catalytic activity for the peroxidation reaction which were employed for the designing of a probe for the K-562 cancer cells sensing. Firstly, porous Pd@Au nanostructures were synthesized and then conjugated with propargyl amine to produce propargyl-Pd@AuNPs. After that, the azidefunctionalized FA molecules were attached to the propargylPd@AuNPs to form the final sensing probe. The obtained dynamic range and LOD of the proposed cytosensor were 100 to 5.0 107 and 38 cells/mL, respectively. The sensitivity of the fabricated sensor is related to the porous and ultrathin nature of Pd@AuNPs which provides various active surface functional groups. As the authors declared, the reported method is robustness and shows favorable selectivity between FR-positive and negative cells.\nThe human breast cancer cells (MCF 7) were differentiated and detected by an electrochemically-orientedmethod based on the FR/ FA interactions using mesoporous (MCM 41). The cavities of MCM 41 materials were functionalized with FA molecules to specify the FR-overexpressed MCF 7 cancer cells to the probe (Fig. 4). The\ndeveloped probe was high specific towards the cancer cells even in the presence of noncancerous cells (MCF 10A), preventing the false positive/negative results. The FA-MCM 41 based method provided linear dynamic range from 100 to 1000 cells/mL. As advantage, this method provides a versatile, specific and biocompatible approach to the recognition of breast cancer cell lines [62].\nRecently the application of SERS based approaches are increased in cellular and tissue imaging [63,64]. SERS based nanosensors have been used as an effective and selective technique to identify different cancer cells. The physical properties of the nanoparticles (as plasmonic nanoparticles) such as shape and size have the most effects on the spectroscopic properties and brightness of the developed nanosensors [65]. Wang et al. [66] applied mesoporous silica coated gold nanorods (MS-GNRs) for targeting of HeLa cancer cells. At first step, cetyltrimethyl ammoniumbromide (CTAB) stabilized-GNRs were produced and then functionalized with SERS active agent and FA molecules, respectively. The reported SERS biosensor shows remarkable advantages of high sensitivity and\nbreast cancer cells. (Reprint license number: 4451501333768).\nspecificity. The SERS excitation and emission wavelengths were located at visible region of electromagnetic spectrum that could be resulted in the deceasing of the background interfering emission and subsequently increasing of the signal to nose ratio and improving the LOD of the method.\nApplication of the magnetic based biosensors in biological media leads to increase the sensitivity of the methods which is originated from the fact that the biological media have not anymagnetic background [67]. Wang et al. [68] reported a magnetic mesoporous nanocomposite of Fe3O4@nSiO2@mSiO2@aptamer core-shell nanoparticles to the ultrasensitive determination of the breast cancer cells. A dual-target detection of the MCF 7 cancer cells was provided by mucin 1 protein (MUC1)/anti MUC1 and FR/FA conjugation which the specificity of the method could be accordingly enhanced. The mechanisms of action of the cytosensor and synthesis approach are presented in Fig. 4. This method provides a dual-target detection strategy which exhibited some advantages of good specificity and low-interference responses. In addition, it could be used in whole blood and plasma samples.\nTo fluorescently trace of the cancer cells, the FA and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules were attached to the bovine serum albumin (BSA) to create FA-BSA-FITC ternary compound, conjugating specifically with the cancer cells (Fig. 5). The achieved dynamic range was from 102 to 105 cells/mL with a detection limit of 100 cells/mL. The proposed probe was utilized to capture and detect the FR-overexpressed MCF 7 cancer cells in human whole blood and plasma samples with favorable recoveries. The reported fluorescence based method provided a simple and pretreatmentfree approach to the detection of the cancer cells in the more complex biological fluid of whole blood [69].\nAs a conclusion of this subsection, it is important to point out that the porous nanomaterials were provided very sensitive approaches to the recognition of the various analytes including biomolecules and cancer cells. Both intricate size of the nanomaterials and porous nature of the named materials can enhance the surface area and then the effective area that could be used for further functionalization. The increased active sites to attach the sensing molecules prompt an equitably large target attachments, which can\nthen be enhanced the sensitivity of the cytosensing platforms. The filtering out capability of the porous materials can remove the contaminant and interfering molecules. The sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors based on porous materials are mainly controlled by the size of the cavities, interstices and channels [70].\nAn overview on the reported cytosensors in “section 2.1” revealed that the cytosensor designed by Wang et al. [44] was the most sensitive cytosensor which can detect FR-positive cancer cells as low as 6 cells/mL. However, gold based nanoparticles with various shapes are the most favorable materials for the detection of cancer cells. Besides the sensitivity of the reported cytosensors, it seems that a cytosensor reported by Ge and coworkers [42] is more potent cytosensor for developing of POC devices."

      "heading" : "2.2.1. Carbon based materials for cytosensing",
      "text" : "Carbon nanomaterials became as a new class of materials with biomedical applications which arose from their exceptional optical and chemical properties. These properties along with their large scale availability in nature enable the carbon based nanostructures as powerful materials to be used instead of the presently used nanomaterials for biosensing, drug delivery and bio-imaging. In compared with other nanostructures, carbon-based materials are almost non-toxic and could be used as a biocompatible materials in different medical fields [71].\n2.2.1.1. Electrochemical. One of the best carbon based materials for sensitive detection is carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Despite outstanding electrical and structural features of the CNTs, the CNTs based cytosensing have not been widely applied in great numbers, yet. A novel approach for the detection cervical carcinoma cell (HeLa) and human leukemia (HL-60) cancer cells was developed by Zheng et al. [72] using specific binding of cancer cells with the FAfunctionalized CNTs. Dopamine was employed to provide the imide groups on the CNTs to the next coupling with the carboxylic groups of the FA molecules. The proposed method provides two dynamic ranges from 5.0 103 to 5.0 105 cells/mL and 5.0 102 to\n5.0 106 cells/mL, for HL-60 and HeLa, respectively. The calculated detection limit of the developed EIS method was 5 102 cells/mL. Dopamine molecules can enhance the conductivity and biocompatibility of CNTs. Stability and selectivity are two main advantages of this cytosensor which facilitate its application even for imaging purposes.\nThe vertically aligned carbon nanotubes) VACNTs (were functionalized with FA molecules to selective entrapment of the lung cancer cells. Plasma treatment was employed to functionalize CNTs with amine groups to the further functionalization with FA molecules. The functionalizations of the VACNTs with FA not only lead to increase the specificity of the probe but also to decrease the deformability of cancer cells. The live cells could be stretched during mechanically entrapped by the non-functionalized VACNTs, affecting the cell viability and limiting the use of the materials for biological assays [73].\nConcerning carbon based nanomaterials, single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have involved much consideration not only owing to their exceptional structure but also owing to the unique electronic and surface area-to-volume ratio when applied as modifying materials for the surface of the electrodes [74]. Liu et al. [75] introduced a lable-free approach for specific and sensitive detection of HeLa as cervical carcinoma cells. The layer-by-layer (LBL) functionalization strategy was used to assemble the FA molecules to the gold electrode surface. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was applied to attach the eCOOH groups on the surface of the Au electrode and then the ferrocene functionalized poly(ethylene imine) (Fc-PEI) and SWNTs were anchored on the gold electrode, respectively. Upon addition of the cancer cells, the peak current was deceased which was linear with the logarithm of cancer cell concentrations from 10 to 106 cells/mL. The LOD of the method is 10 cells/mL even in the presence of HEK 293 FR-negative normal cells. The reported label-free method is free from interfering agents and can differentiate normal cells from cancer cells and also provides a non-invasive cell recognition approach.\nWang et al. [76] presented a sensitive EIS method to the determination of the HeLa cancer cells. FA coupled PEI molecules were conjugated to the CNTs to create a fluorescent compound of FA-PEICNTs (Fig. 6). The reported method showed a LOD of about 90 cells/ mL, as well as a dynamic range of 2.4 102 to 2.4 105 HeLa cells/ mL. The high sensitivity of the reported method was achieved by intrinsic properties of the CNTs which frequently were applied to enhance the sensitivity and also response time of the\nelectrochemical biosensing methods [77,78]. In addition, the dendrimeric shapes of the PEI molecules provide more eNH2 groups for FA conjugation, increasing the sensitivity of the cytosensor.\nTo combine the advantages of both bare graphene and graphene oxide (GO), the partially oxidized graphene (POG) particles were produced by partially oxidation of the graphene sheets. Gao et al. [79] utilized FA-functionalized graphene to the electrochemical based sensing of the HeLa cancer cells. The developed method showed a wide dynamic range from 200 to 6400 cells/mL. The authors were used POG to the construction of the sensor where the using of the POG can enhance the electrochemical activity and amount of the attaching of the FA molecules to the surface of the POG by increasing the number of the active functional groups. As an advantage, the probe could be constructed on few minutes in a single step reaction. Also, the sensitivity and reproducibility of the developed method are favorable for clinical uses where the low detection limit was 140 cells/mL. Fig. 7 represents the HeLa sensing mechanism by the EIS electrochemical method.\n2.2.1.2. Optical. Graphene is one the most used carbon based materials which are frequently used in the development of the sensing platforms [80]. Graphene shows unique electrical and structural characteristics, suggesting potential applications in electrochemical or field-effect transistor-based biosensing [81]. Soleymani et al. [82] introduced a resonance RRS based method for the sensing of the MKN 45 gastric cancer cells. The FA functionalized N-doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were utilized to increase the selectivity of the method. N-GQDs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and then functionalized with FA molecules using EDC/NHS reaction protocol. Upon incubation, the FR-positive cancer cells were specifically attached to the FA-N-GQDs and subsequently the scattering signal of the developed probe was increased in which the signal was linear from 100 to 7.0 104 cells/mL. The FA-functionalized N-GQDs exhibited high photo-bleachibility, storage stability and low cytotoxicity. In addition, the developed method was applicable for detection of MCF 7 and HT 29 cancer cells. The developed probe provides sensitive and selective method with simple operating system which is able to be extended for cancer detection in clinical applications.\nPrabhakar et al. [83] applied graphene oxide nanoparticles (nGO) nanoparticles as photoluminescence tags to sense the HeLa cancer cells. GO based materials are fluorescent materials where their emissions are originated from the band gap of the isolated sp2\nof the nano-sized carbon islands. The carbon islands are produced by partial oxidation/reduction of the GO sheets. To increase the sensitivity of probe, the poly(ethylene imine) e poly(ethylene glycol) was attached on the surface of the nGO to increase theeNH2 functional groups attaching to the carboxylic groups of the FA molecules via click chemistry. To date, about 90% of the reported carbon based cytosensors are electrochemically developed methods. The key factors that must be considered to design the electrochemical cytosensors are sensitivity, repeatability, specificity, stability, low-cost, ease of construction and also simple detection procedure. Driven the favorable requirements of the electrochemical cytosensors, the carbon based materials are ideal materials for the construction of electrochemical based analytical methods. In one hand, the carbon based materials are about free to obtain, in other hand; various methods to alter the pristine materials are simple. Also, the large scale productions of the carbon based materials are comparably cost effective. However, the production of some of the carbon based materials suffer from diversity of chirality, structural dimensions and also contaminate agents that often affect the properties of the produced carbon base materials [84]. It seems that the combination of carbon based materials and FR cytosensing approaches will introduce more versatile methods with high sensitivity and selectivity which these favorable analytical figures are mainly caused by high surface area of carbon based materials and specific binding of FA and FR, respectively."

      "heading" : "2.2.2. Polymers in cytosensing",
      "text" : "Various types of polymers have been broadly applied in the fabrication of different types of sensors. Polymers exploit great improvement in specificity, reproducibility, flexibility, stability and sensitivity of the developed sensors. The collaboration of the nanomaterials with the polymers can improve the analytical performances of the developed methods by the synergistic effect. Several polymers, natural and synthesized, show advantages of charge transfer and high redox efficiency properties which are accounted for the non-localized p-electrons [85].\n2.2.2.1. Electrochemical. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone)/clays (PCL/clays) are exfoliated materials with many attracted properties such as biodegradability and improved physico-chemical properties. In a report, this clay was modified and functionalized with FA which not only enhanced specificity of cytosensor, but also displayed exceptional high surface area-to-volume ratio and low toxicity. The organomodified clay (Cloisite 30B [MMTe(CH2CH2OH)2]) with high density of OH groups was functionalized with FA molecules and then polymerized to produce a polymeric clay. The produced clay was used to modify the GCE electrode surface for the specific detection of cancer cells. The developed electrochemical probe signal was linear over 1 102 and1 104HeLa cells/mL. Fig. 8 shows the synthesis of the FAfunctionalized polymeric clay for the biosensing of cancer cells [86]. The main advantage of the reported method is facile surface modification of the produced clay.\nGurudatt et al. [87] fabricated a conducting polymer based biosensor for the detection of leukemia cell line (Jurkat E6-1). For this aim, the [2,20:50,200-terthiophene]- 30,40-diamine (DATT) conducting polymer was functionalized with amine groups to attach to the carboxylic groups of the FA molecules. Then the FA modified polymer was casted on the surface of the GCE as a substrate for the capturing of the cancer cells (Fig. 9). This method showed wide dynamic ranges from 1.0 103 to 2.5 105 cells/mL and 1.0 103 to 8.0 103 cells/mL with LODs of 68 cells/mL and 21 cells/mL, respectively. The intrinsic high electrical conductivity of the conducting polymers can offer ultrasensitive detection possibility by bioengineering of the surface of the electrochemical electrodes [88]. The ability to sense cancer cells without using indicator molecules is an advantage of the reportedmethodwhich is need for development of devices for real time sensing of cancer cells.\nAzak et al. [89] fabricated an electrochemical cytosensor by modification of the surface of GCE electrode. To construct the cytosensor, the 4-[4H-dithieno(3,2-b:20,30-d)pyrrol-4-yl]aniline (DTP-aryl-NH2) was electropolymerized on the surface of the electrode and then FA molecules were attached to the NH2 ends by EDC/NHS reaction. GCE/DTP-aryl-NH2/FA based cytosensor is able to quantify HeLa cancer cells from 10 to 105 cells/mL with a LLOQ of\n10 cells/mL. High sensitivity is the main advantage of this cytosensor, however laborious construction steps and using of organic solvent in the electropolymerization process can limit its uses for biomedical applications.\n2.2.2.2. QCM. Recently, QCM technology has been utilized in various fields due to their simplicity, non-invasive, real-time, label-free, cost-effectiveness, low analysis time and sensitivity [90]. Zhang et al. [91] reported a QCM cytosensor to the recognition of the MCF 7 cancer cells in human blood samples. Chitosan (CS)-FA as natural polymer was coated to the gold electrode to use as a sensitive biosensing probe for MCF 7 cancer cells. The developed method provides simple construction approach with real-time and on-line cell analysis with dynamic range from 4.5 102 to 1.01 105 cells/mL with a LOD of 430 cells/mL. Usually, the reported electrochemical and QCM methods show sensitive approaches for sensing of the FR-positive cancer cells. These methods provide continuous and non-invasive monitoring of cancer cells which were widely applied for the adhesion of cells [92].\nAs discussed above, polymers possess some features that are important in sensor designing. A major disadvantage of polymers is their low electricity conductivities which limits their applications\nin sensor designing. Conducting polymers enhanced the intrinsic conductivity of the polymers which currently are being utilized for encapsulation and modification of materials. In addition, the low/ non-conducting polymers could be applied as linking agents to assemble the specific receptors such as FR, glycan and etc. on the surface of the materials in the sensor designing [93].\nRegarding all reported FR-based sensors (section 2.2) for cytosening of various cancer cells, it seems that clay based cytosensor reported by Liu and coworkers [75] provides the most sensitive method with LOD of about 10 cells/mL and favorable dynamic range which could be more investigated to design POC device for the detection of FR-overexpressed cancer cells. However, electrochemical technique and carbon based materials are the most used method and materials for the detection of cancer cells, respectively. Also, QCM based cytosensors provide the most exciting approaches which will more use in the near future works."

      "text" : "This section is provided hybrid nanomaterials which were used in cancer cells detection with applying the FA/FR strategy.\n2.3.1.1. Electrochemical. Peptide nanotubes (PNTs) are selfassembled biological nanostructures with simple SAM conditions to decorate the functional groups on the surface of biomolecules. Castillo et al. [94] described a modified graphene electrode for the biosensing of the human cervical cancer cells. PNTs were synthesized by addition of biphenylalanine peptide powder in 1,1,1,3,3,3- hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP) and alcohol, resulting in the fast production of PNTs. The produced PNTs were functionalized with FA molecules to use as a specific agent for cancer cell detection. In this work, the surface of the graphene electrode was functionalized with FA-functionalize peptide nanotubes, leading to the increment of the electrode response. The LOD of the method was 250 cells/mL. The peptide based nanostructures as a biological molecules could rapidly be produced in mild reaction conditions [95]. Despite the facile fabrication steps, the cytosensor suffers from high-cost and time-consuming procedure.\nRecently, Ding and coworkers [96] reported a pressure based sensor for the determination of FR-overexpressed cancer cells. They synthesized FA-conjugated CuO/Co3O4 nanofiber where can specifically attach to the FR-positive cancer cells. In the presence of the ammonia borane (AB), hydrogen (H2) was generated as catalyzing effect of the nanofiber and hence leads to increase the H2 pressure. The developed probe provided a wide linear range from 50 to 105 cells/mL with a LOD of about 50 cells/mL for HeLa cells. The favorable performance of the probe could be attributed to the effectiveness of the photocatalytic activity of the nanofibers and high H2 producing capacity of AB. It seems that the proposed method is able to perform as an early stage POC device for cancer diagnosis even in whole blood media.\nLi et al. [97] employed an electrochemical current rectifier (ECR) device to sensitive analysis of FR-rich HeLa cancer cells. Initially, the surface of electrode should be covered with an insulating material such as 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA) to reduce the electron transferring between electrode and electrolyte. To\nFig. 10. Developing of the TMV-FA-Pt NPs for selective detection of the FR-positive cancer ce\nconstruct the cell sensor, the surface of the gold electrode was functionalized with 11-undecanethiol-1-ferrocene (UDT-Fc) and MHDA as electron transfer mediator (ET) and surface insulating agent, respectively. In the presence of the K2IrCl6, the cathodic current is increased as a main feature of ECR based sensors. The cathodic current of probe is linear against log of HeLa FR-rich cells from 0 to 106 HeLa cells/mL with a LLOQ of as low as 10 cells/mL. The reported signal is remained unchanged even in the presence of a 105 cells/mL of HEK 293 FR-negative normal cells, approving the selective manner of the cytosensor.\nAlso, a novel cytosensing strategy was developed by Hu et al. [98]. In this work, the FA assembled Ag@BSA microspheres were used to the detection of KB cancer cells by modifying of the Au electrode surface. Firstly, Ag@BSA microspheres were anchored on the surface of the gold electrode and then immersed to the EDC/ NHS activated FA solution to attach FA molecules to the Ag@BSA microspheres. The FA-Ag@BSA modified gold electrode was able to assay KB FR-positive cancer cells in the range of 60 to 1.2 108 cells/mL with a LLOQ of 20 cells/mL. As the authors declared, this biosensor possesses the prominent advantages of biocompatibility, favor sensitivity and reproducibility, meeting the requirements for possible uses in early stage detection of cancers.\nZhao et al. [99] reported a novel DNA based cytosensor for the specific detection of MCF 7 breast cancer cells. Sensing mechanism is based on digestion of bonds between FA and DNA by exonuclease I where in the presence of the cancer cells, the digestion could be prevented which is resulted in an increase on the current of the probe. The synthesis approach was started by attachment of FAlinked DNA segments on the surface of gold electrode and then followed by addition of exonuclease I and cancer cells. The suggested probe signal is linear from 102 to 106 cells/mL with a LOD of 67 cells/mL. Despite the advantages provided by this cytosensor, the fabrication time is high (about 17 h) and limits its application in screening of cancers.\nlls.

Optical. Quantum dots (QDs) are fluorescent materials with superior spectroscopic properties including high photoluminescence quantum yields, narrow and tunable emission bands. These properties make QDs as a favorable replacements of organic dyes for different biomedical requests [100].\nZhang et al. [101] reported a QD-based strategy that enables these materials to specifically attach and sense FR-positive cancer cells. The reported fluorescent based strategy relies on the electrostatic attraction of the negatively charged QDs and positively charged Ru complex and quenching of QDs fluorescence by Ru complex. Upon addition of the target HeLa cancer cells, FAconjugated single-stranded DNA (F-sDNA) binds selectively with FRs on the target cancer cell membranes by high affinity between FA and FR, resulting to the recovering of the QDs fluorescence. The biosensor response is linear from 100 to 105 cells/mL with a LOD of 100 cells/mL and can specifically attach to the FR-positive target HeLa cells nor not targeted normal cells. This method exhibited some advantages of avoided the use of organic dyes and enzymes in sensor construction and could be also used for cellular imaging by a fluorescence turn-on mode.\nGuo et al. [102] constructed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based cell sensor for the detection of MCF 7 and HeLa cancer cells. Fig. 10 shows the probe designing steps where native tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was used as substrate of the sensor. Firstly, the surface of the substrate was functionalized with N3PEG1000-FA through Cu(I)-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction to reach TMV-FA [103]. Then, an in situ method was used to deposit the Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the TMVFA macromolecules. The produced TMV-FA-Pt NPs sensor was used for recognition of target cancer cells. In the presence of H2O2, 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (as chromogenic agent) was oxidized which this reaction catalyzed by TMV-FA-Pt NPs and the amplified signal was recorded by a spectrophotometer. The developed method showed good stability while the sensitivity of the probe was limited to about the detection of the 1.0 104 cells/mL.\nIn this section (2.3), some materials with superior properties were utilized for cytosensing. For example, QDs and PNTs were used to the construction of electrochemical and fluorescent cytosensors, respectively. In one hand, PNTs provide active substrate which can simply be functionalized for the designing of various types of electrochemical based sensors, in another hand; QDs can serve optically active nanoparticles to design direct and/or indirect probes for the detections of cancer cells."

      "text" : "Determination of the tumor site is the first step in cancer diagnosis and then therapy. Therefore, fabricating of efficient\napproaches for selective and precise targeting of tumoral cancer cells has high importance in clinics. For this aim, fluorescence imaging based methods play main role in the imaging of cancers because of some attracted features of high sensitivity and spectral efficiency.\nCarbon based fluorescent materials attracted attentions due to their low toxicity, high biocompatibility, stability and facility of surface modification. Liu et al. [104] used carbon dots (CDs) for the selective imagining of FR-positive cancer cells. For this aim, FA molecules were attached on the surfaces of CDs via hydrogen bonds. The synthesized nanomaterials provide a photo-stable platform with simple and one-step synthesis approach for the imaging of HeLa and HepG2 cancer cells. As a mechanism of action, after anchoring of FA molecules to the CDs, the fluorescence of CDs quenched where upon attachments to the FR-positive cancer cells the fluorescence of CDs were recovered. Also, Jiao et al. [105] attached FAmolecules to the surface of CDs by EDC/NHS reaction to produce a covalent bond between FA and CDs. Qian et al. [106] produced CDs from aconitic acid and functionalized with FA for the targeted imaging of HeLa, SMMC-7721, and A549 cancer cells. Zhang et al. [107] proposed the same approach for the imaging of HepG2 FR-positive cancer where CDs nanoparticles were produced from active dry yeast (ADY) as initial precursor. In comparison to the other precursors, reported ADY based CDs showed an increased quantum yield of about 50%.\nZhao et al. [108] synthesized a nanohybrid by combining of mesoporous silica and CDs for the construction of a fluorescent platform for FRs-based specific detection of HeLa, MCF-7 and A549 cancer cells where the selectivity of the nanoplatformwas checked using a FRs-negative L929 normal cells. The FA-functionalized nanohybrid displayed favorable biocompatibility, high stability, high fluorescence yield, bright fluorescence emission and selective manner towards targeting of FRs-positive cancer cells. The present nanohybrid could be utilized as an efficient tool for imaging of tumoral cancer cells.\nLiu et al. [109] attached a Raman-active materials i.e. 5,50- dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DNBA)-N3 to the surface of hollow gold nanoparticles (HAuNPs) to produce HAuNP-DNBA-N3, SERS active probe. A “click reaction” was applied to the conjugation of folate bicyclo[6.1.0]nonynes to the HAuNP-DNBA-N3. The produced nanomaterials i.e. HAuNP-DNBA-FA displays favorable ability to attach FR-overexpressed KB, HeLa and A549 cancer cells. Li et al. [110] utilized BSA stabilized AuNCs for the construction of a fluorescence turn-on imaging of HeLa tumoral cells. The FA-quenched fluorescence of BSA-AuNCs nanoparticles was recovered by attaching to the FR-positive cancer cells via FA-FRs bonds. The suggested platform could be applied as an effective tool for imaging of FR-overexpressed cancer cells. Other reported FRs-based\nimaging methods were well-discussed and reported in recent some review articles [36e38] and also summarized in Table 2.\nNanomaterials-based optical imaging of solid tumors shows several advantages of high resolution, favorable sensitivity and noninvasive approaches when comparing with the old-fashioned imaging procedures. Optically active materials are preferred to the radioactive materials because of facile modification of these materials and safety issues. Thus, the synthesis of new advanced materials for designing of novel smart carriers with facile synthesis procedures and excellent targeting capability are of great importance. However, designing of selective approaches such as FR-based methods offers more specialized ways to the imaging and also therapy of cancer cells without any effects on the normal cells."

      "text" : "In conclusion, the contribution of materials (especially nanomaterials) in the construction of cytosensors based on the FA/FR interactions was reviewed. FRs are overexpressed about in all cancer cells, enabling to the selective detection of the cancer cells. FR-based recognition of cancer cells essentially relies on binding of FA-functionalized nanomaterials with FR of the cancer cells which governs the specificity of FR-based sensing platforms. Due to the exceptional and fascinating properties of the nanomaterials, these types of materials have been widely utilized in the sensing of various analytes. Ease of synthesis and surface modification, high surface area-to-volume ratio, electrochemical and spectroscopic activities, favorable biocompatibility and biodegradability are some favorable properties of the most of the nanomaterials which enable to fabricate the sensors with improved sensitivity and selectivity. In targeted sensing, the nanomaterials were exploited to monitor and amplify the binding effect of the FA and FR overexpressed on the membrane of the cancer cells. Also, in “section 3”, the reported FR based imaging of cancer cells was discussed.\nFrom the reviewed papers, it is obvious that the electrochemical based methods are the most favorite techniques to the FR-based cancer cells detection which are as a result of the intrinsic properties of the methods. Besides the sensitivity, the electrochemical based approaches lead to enhance the chance of an analyte sensing. Also, the optical based methods were applied to the sensing of the cancer cells. SPR and SERS approaches offer label-free recognition of the cancer cells with simple construction steps which allow using in the in situ detection of cancer cells.\nAmong the discussed materials, Au and carbon based materials were mostly utilized to the detection of the FR-rich cancer cells. AuNPs show friendly synthesis methods with about nontoxic manner which could be easily functionalized with thiol groups for further surface modification with simple reaction such as “click chemistry”. High refractive indexes of AuNPs make them as sensitive materials for the SPR based sensing of the cancer cells. The SPR of the functionalized AuNPs happens at a specific angle which is specific for the surface property of the AuNPs. Upon binding of the cancer cells to FA functionalized surface of the AuNPs a measurable target specific signal is produced and recorded.\nDespite the favorable analytical performance of the reported nanomaterials based cytosensors, there is still a huge demand to design more versatile and accurate methods for the detection of cancer cells in the future projects. The future sensor designing attempts could be listed as following. The lake of optical based methods to sense the cancer cells is obvious which could be regarded in the future sensors. Employing of the other receptors with combination of FRs to construct dual targeted sensors can introduce cytosensors with higher specificity and sensitivity. Finally, in all the reported examples, the sensors were used to detect cancer cell lines and at present no data are available using\nclinical samples; thus, it is predicted that the future studies will focus on the methods and/or devices which can detect cancer cells in vivo matrices. Table 1 lists the details of the reported FR-based strategies for the sensing of the FR-positive cancer cells. Wide range of LODs from 6 to 104 cells/mL are provided by the reported methodswhere HeLa andMCF 7 are themain cancer cells that were detected using the FR strategies, arising from the FR concentration of the membrane of these cells.\nIn summary, various detection techniques and nanomaterials with different properties were applied to the sensing of FR-positive cancer cells. However, some of the fabricated methods are very complex and usually need several steps to design, which limit the designing of FR-based devices. Thus, it is essential to design more cheap, accurate, and commercially possible device technology to introduce the more convenient, portable, repeatable and sensitive FR-based POC devices in the near future."

    "abstractText" : "Cancer is the second main reason of human deaths around the world. Developing accurate and effective techniques to the early stage diagnosis of cancer are very vital to start the treatment process. Targeted detection of the cancerous cell is the most reliable approach to the identification of cancer solid tumors. Folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed on the membrane of many types of cancers and is a fascinating molecule for targeting cancer because of the high affinity between FR and folic acid (FA) (Kd z 10 pM). Such fact was extremely utilized to develop the imaging of solid tumors and targeted delivery of drugs. This review discusses the critical role of FRs for the quantitative recognition of cancer cells. In this regard, the applied advanced materials in the designing of the FR-based cytosensors and the state-of-art of the cytosensing devices were discussed that may be have possible uses as a device in the clinical diagnosis of various cancers. Also, the analytical performances and the favorable features of the reported methods were explored. The present review covers the reported FR-based methods for the detection of cancer cells from 2010 to 2019 and will be a useful reference for the future works. Moreover, the applications of FR-based strategy in cancer cells imaging were also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
