      "text" : "Biomass resources are a source of green energy, largely due to their clean, environment-\nfriendly, and renewability features. Crop straw is one of the world's largest biomass resources. The annual output of crop straw in China itself had reached more than 700 million tons during the mid-1990s, accounting for about 25% of the world crop residue productions [1,2], and with outputs increasing in recent years. However, about 50% of the agricultural residues are wasted due to open burning. Moreover, the pollutants released from extensive burning of agricultural residues, such as black carbon particles, nitrogen oxides, and sulfides, cause serious deterioration of air quality and consequently affect public health [3,5]. In order to keep the environment in rural areas clean and promote sustainable waste management, efficient utilization of available crop straw resources have been extensively studied [5-8]. The main component of crop straw is cellulose which is a potential raw material for manufacturing lowcost composite materials [9-11]. Many studies have been carried out on thermoplastic matrix composites reinforced with natural fibers (NFs) [12-13]. Endowed with excellent strength and simple manufacturing techniques, these materials find extensive applications as railings, windows, doors, and garden architecture. However, certain shortcomings, such as large mass, poor toughness and impact strength, have limited their potential applications [14,15]. Foamed bio-composites reinforced with wood or NFs help in overcoming some of these disadvantages and hence have attracted much attention [16,17]. For outdoor applications, where there is an exposure to direct sunlight, it is crucial to improve UV-resistance of these natural fiber-plastic composites. Moreover, the mechanical strength of foamed composites is related to its internal\nmicrocellular structure [18]. To reduce the susceptibility of foamed agricultural straw fiberplastic composites to degradation by UV light, various additives, such as UV absorbers, pigments, and antioxidants, have to be added to extend the service life of these composites [19,20]. Additionally, in order to improve their mechanical strength, it is necessary to incorporate either maleic anhydride grafted polymers, silanes or nanoclay [21]. Moreover, surface modification of NFs was also carried out to improve the interfacial adhesion between natural fillers and matrices [22,23]. Research in the field of nanocomposite materials provides considerable options for modifying NFs to improve material performance. Lazaros et al. [24] investigated the mechanical properties of natural rubber hierarchical composites reinforced with carbon nanotube modified short jute fiber. Generally, the mechanical properties of NF and other fillers reinforced composites have a great correlation with the interfacial adhesion between fillers and matrix [25]. The dispersion state of the fillers in composites is also directly affected by the processing method. Xiao [26] prepared nano-Al2O3/polypropylene(PP)/wood fiber composites by impregnating wood fibers with nano-Al2O3 suspension in ethanol, which improved their flexural strengths, flexural moduli, and impact strengths. Deka et al. [27,28] studied the effect of nano-SiO2, and ZnO on the properties of wood polymer nanocomposites. According to them, incorporation of nano-SiO2, and ZnO improved its UV resistance, flame retardancy, and chemical resistance. In a parallel study, the introduction of nanofillers significantly improved the properties of wood, such as water resistance and chemical resistance [29]. These findings suggested that it is possible to modify NFs with nanoparticles and use them as reinforcements for thermoplastic matrix. Among these nanofillers, nano-TiO2 particle is a wide band gap semiconductor material with gap energy above 2.8 eV, which can absorb\nUV-light. Moreover, TiO2 also has good stability. These excellent physical properties make it a promising candidate material for UV shielding [30-32]. Notably, the particle size and dispersibility of nano-TiO2 are paramount [33]. Hence, it is necessary to disperse nano-TiO2 and prevent aggregation [34]. To achieve this, aliphatic acids, surfactants or alcohols have been considered to modify the surfaces of nanoparticles [35]. Researchers have also conducted indepth investigation on the surface modification of nanoparticles using silane coupling agents [36,37]. In the presence of hydrophilic groups, silane coupling agents are adsorbed on the surfaces of nano-TiO2 and react with the -OH groups [6]. Chen and Yakovlev [38] verified that active functional groups can be grafted onto nanoparticle surfaces through Si-O-Ti bonds. Moreover, modification of nano-TiO2 by coupling agent is the most economical method to improve the compatibility between the filler and polymers [30,34]. However, there is limited information demonstrating the effect of nano-TiO2 on UV resistance and mechanical properties for the foamed fiber/plastic hierarchical composites.\nThe main objective of this present study is to develop wheat straw fibers (WSFs)\nreinforced PP foamed hierarchical composites with excellent UV-shielding properties and mechanical strengths, using silane-modified nano-TiO2 as a novel interphase filler. The results showed that the dispersibility of the modified nano-TiO2, which treated with trimethoxyvinylsilane (A171) or (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (KH550), were improved and confirmed by Laser particle size analyzer (LS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)mapping. Moreover, the resultant modified nano-TiO2 treated WSFs were embedded in the PP matrix, and exposed good UV-shielding properties and significant reinforcing effects as revealed by the UV-vis spectroscopy analysis and mechanical tests. The surface modification\nmechanism of nano-TiO2 and the binding mechanism of modified-TiO2 with WSFs and PP were also clarified to understand the interfacial interaction, and confirmed by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Overall, the dispersibility of modified nano-TiO2 and porous microstructure of composite played an important role on the improved UV-visible light transmittance and enhanced interfacial adhesion strength."

      "text" : "Nano-TiO2 has a high surface energy and a large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface,\nwhich is prone to agglomeration in organic media. The enhancement effect of nanoparticles on\ncomposites depends on the dispersion state and interfacial compatibility of nanoparticles. Studies have shown that silane coupling agent modified nano-TiO2 particles can be dispersed in solution uniformly and stably [30]. The size distributions of pure TiO2, A171-modified TiO2, and KH550-modified TiO2 in ethanol are shown in Fig. 3. The results indicated that the particle sizes of unmodified TiO2 varied widely and showed a large average diameter (102.5 nm). In addition, the interface between the sediment and the supernatant is obvious, and the thickness of the sediment is small (Fig. 3c). This showed that the pure nano-TiO2 readily formed aggregates, and dispersed non-homogeneously in ethanol. Fig. 3b shows that the particle size variations were lesser and average diameter was smaller in case of surface-modified nanoTiO2. The average diameter of KH550-modified and A171-modified TiO2 were 37.3 nm and 76.2 nm, respectively. The interface between the sediment and the supernatant is not obvious, and it is a thick flocculent precipitate. This also suggested that surface modification prevented the aggregation of nano-TiO2, and the nanoparticles had a relatively homogeneous dispersion in ethanol. The diameter of KH550-modified nano-TiO2 was lesser compared with A171modified nano-TiO2, possibly due to the higher grafting efficiency of KH550 as compared to that of A171. Homogeneity of nanoparticulate dispersion was particularly important, since all advantages of nano-TiO2 could only be achieved if TiO2 was homogeneously dispersed [40]. The relative dispersities of the three types of nano-TiO2 were also evident from the sedimentation phenomenon, after standing for 3 days at room temperature (Fig. 3c). In case of all nanoparticles, the suspensions eventually separated into sediments and supernatant. However, a separate interface between the sediment and supernatant could be seen in case of unmodified nano-TiO2 particles. This was least obvious (more homogeneous) in case of\nKH550-modified nano-TiO2 particles. Besides, a very thin layer of sediment accumulated at the bottom in unmodified nano-TiO2 nanoparticles, while A171-modified and KH550modified nano-TiO2 particles showed thicker sediments. This further proved that silane coupling agent played a role in enhancing the homogeneity of nano-TiO2 in ethanol."

      "text" : "XRD patterns were obtained to evaluate the crystallinities of the nano-TiO2 and WSFs.\ncellulose at 2θ = 17°, 22.5°, and 35°, respectively. The WSFs treated with nano-TiO2 particles showed reflections at the same positions as those of the untreated WSFs. This indicated that the nanoparticles did not penetrate into the crystalline regions of cellulose nor did they change\nthe crystalline structures of WSFs. Meanwhile, some characteristic peaks, which were associated with the crystal structure of nano-TiO2, were observed at 25.34° (101), 37.84° (004), 48.00° (200), 54.00° (211), 55.14° (220), and 62.74° (204). The unchanged positions of TiO2 characteristic peaks confirmed the penetrate of nano-TiO2 particles into non-crystalline regions of WSFs. No obvious differences in XRD patterns were evident among the WSFs treated with three types of nano-TiO2 particles, which was consistent with the XRD discussion of nanoTiO2 as shown in Fig. 4a.\nFTIR curves of nano-TiO2, A171-modified nano-TiO2, and KH550-modified nano-TiO2\nnanoparticles are presented in Fig. 4c. As for the original nano-TiO2, the peaks in the range of 3400-3200 cm−1 and around 1630 cm−1 were corresponded to stretching and bending vibrations of -OH groups of absorbed water on the surface of nano-TiO2, respectively [41,42]. The peaks below 700 cm-1 which were attributed to Ti-O and Ti-O-Ti bonding of TiO2 particles, were ignored in this analysis due to the oversaturated absorption [30]. After modification with the two coupling agents, the intensities of -OH peaks were found to decrease. This suggested an interaction between silanol groups from hydrolyzed coupling agents and surface -OH groups of nano-TiO2 [27]. The peak of Si-O-Si bond at 1276 cm-1 was observed in the spectra of both the modified nano-TiO2 samples, demonstrating the condensation reaction occurred between silanol groups of coupling agent [30]. The intensity of Si-O-Si peak in A171-modified nanoTiO2 was stronger than that in KH550-modified nano-TiO2, which implied that the grafting efficiency of KH550 was much higher than that of A171. Furthermore, peak at 1030 cm-1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of Ti-O-Si [38,43]. In the spectrum of TiO2 modified with A171, peaks at 2958 cm-1 and 1620 cm-1, correspond to C-H asymmetrical stretching vibration\nand C=C stretching, respectively [44], were observed, suggesting the presence of A171 on the surface of modified TiO2. In case of KH550, characteristic peaks at 2958 cm−1 and 1550 cm−1 were assigned to C-H asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the methyl group and -NH2, respectively. The presence of these peaks proved that –NH2 in KH550 were successfully grafted onto the surfaces of nano-TiO2. Since, residual or physically-adsorbed silane coupling agents were removed by extraction with ethanol followed by centrifugation; the above mentioned (Fig. 4c) peaks are evidence that functional groups in A171 and KH550 were successfully grafted onto the surfaces of nano-TiO2.\nTo study the interactions between surface modified nano-TiO2 and WSFs, the chemical\nstructures of WSFs, WSFs treated with TiO2, A171-modified nano-TiO2, and KH550-modified nano-TiO2 were all characterized. Fig. 4d showed presence of peaks at 3320 cm-1 assigned to stretching vibrations of intramolecular -OH group, and at 2918 cm-1 and 2853 cm-1 correspond to C-H stretching vibrations of -CH2- and -CH3, respectively. The peak at 1034 cm−1 due to – OH bending along with shoulder peaks at about 1158 cm−1 and 897 cm−1 were due to C–O–C stretching vibrations [6,45]. After treatment with surface modified TiO2, the broad peak at 3320 cm-1 (as shown in Figs. 4d3-4) was evidently weakened and was shifted slightly to lower wavenumbers. This was an indication that there were interactions between the -OH on the surface of WSFs and modified nano-TiO2. Furthermore, peaks due to C-H stretching vibrations at 2918 cm-1 and 2853 cm-1 were strengthened, as a consequence of overlapping of C-H groups on the surface modified TiO2. Also, the intensity of C-H stretching vibrations of WSFs treated with KH550-modified nano-TiO2 was much higher than that of WSFs treated with A171. This was owing to the fact that KH550-modified nano-TiO2, with smaller particle size, were well\nimpregnated into the WSFs. A similar increase in intensity of C-H peak was analyzed by Deka and Maji [27]. Meanwhile, the weak peak at 1200 cm−1 for all modified fibers, which was assigned to the Si–O–cellulose bond, suggested chemical bonding between silanol groups and WSFs."

In presence of water, silane coupling agents undergo hydrolysis to generate silanol groups (-Si-OH). After the -Si-OH are formed, a portion of them undergo self-condensation to form Si-O-Si bonds. The others react with the hydroxyl groups of TiO2 surface and form either Ti-O-Si bonds or remain free and form hydrogen bonds [33]. Longer molecular chains of silanes are effective in preventing aggregation of nano-TiO2.\nThe proposed mechanism of interaction between WSFs and surface modified nano-TiO2\nis presented in Fig. 5c. The –OH present on the surface of WSFs can either condense with silanol groups in free state or form hydrogen bonds with unmodified –OH groups or -NH2 groups on nano-TiO2. Furthermore, the silane coupling agents adsorbed on nano-TiO2 can be intertwined with PP molecular chains, which strengthens the interface adhesion between WSFs and PP."

The unmodified TiO2 particles exhibited strong UV-shielding ability between\n200 to 400 nm. Nano-TiO2 particles, which is a wide band gap semiconductor with gap energy above 2.8eV [32], is a UV absorber with high performance due to its ultraviolet absorptivity and light scattering ability [33]. The introduction of nano-TiO2 reduced the UV light transmittance of all WSFs. The transmittance of samples treated with unmodified nano-TiO2 was more than the samples with surface modified TiO2 particles in the 200-400 nm region. This was due to the property of TiO2 particles to form aggregates. It was also reported that the TiO2 particles with more homogeneous dispersion, exhibited enhanced UV protection [46]. The effects of TiO2 particle concentration on the UV-shielding abilities were also studied. The UV-visible light transmittance decreased only slightly with increase in concentration of surface modified TiO2 particles. There were no obvious differences between the two types of modified TiO2 particles on the UV-shielding properties of WSFs."

      "text" : "SEM images of WSFs treated with different concentrations of nano-TiO2 are presented in\nFig. 7. Nano-TiO2 was found adsorbed on the entire surface of WSFs, including cell cavities and intercellular spaces. In case of WSFs treated with 1% KH550-modified TiO2 particles, most of the nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed within the lumina of fibers. However, in case of WSFs treated with unmodified nano-TiO2, the nanoparticles tended to aggregate, and these aggregates were mainly attached to the surfaces of fibers (Figs. 8a-b). Excessive nanoTiO2 that accumulated on fiber surfaces affected the interfacial strength between WSFs and PP matrix [47]. The SEM-mapping images (Figs. 7a’-d’) provide more detailed information about the dispersion of the nano-TiO2 in the WSFs matrix. For the WSFs treated by A171- and KH550-modified 1 % TiO2, the Ti element was evenly distributed, and no significant\ndifferences could be found from the SEM-mapping images (Figs. 7a’-b’). For the WSF treated by A171- and KH550-modified 5 % TiO2, the Ti element was evenly distributed, but aggregation would happen (Fig. 7c’-d’). This was because the surface of the WSFs was coated with a small amount of TiO2, and the excess TiO2 could not be uniformly filled on the surface of the WSFs, so aggregation occurs. In addition, for unmodified TiO2, the Ti element in the matrix distribution was not uniform due to the nano-TiO2 agglomerated easily (Figs. 8a-b). Also, a significant improvement of the TiO2 dispersion could be seen in the composite matrix by adding the silane-modified TiO2 particles (Fig. 8f’-g’).\nFigs. 8a-b depicts the SEM images of unmodified and modified nano-TiO2 particles, the\nSEM and SEM-mapping images of the fractured surfaces for F-WSFs/PP composites are presented in Figs. 8c-i’. For composites without nano-TiO2 addition (Fig. 8c), there were many cracks in the cross section of the composite and the holes left when the fibers were pulled out, which was consistent with the lower mechanical properties. After the addition of TiO2, the interfacial bonding properties of the composites were improved. However, the unmodified TiO2 particles were easily aggregated (Figs. 8a-b), which tend to cause a rough fiber structure during the preparation of the composites (Figs. 8d-e). After TiO2 particles were modified by the silane coupling agent (A171 and KH550), the PP matrix could uniformly wrap the WSFs and exhibit better interface bonding. However, the excessive nano-TiO2 particles forms a weak interfacial layer on the surface of the WSFs, which deteriorated the interface bond with the PP matrix. This was because TiO2 was not completely impregnated into the interior of the WSFs, and the foaming pore size of the composites was increased, and a large number of small cells were also formed inside. In addition, the weaker interface bonding tends to cause the cell walls\nto rupture and the cells to merge and become larger. Compared with A171 modified TiO2, KH550 modified TiO2 was more likely to form strong chemical bond at the interface of the composites [48]. Therefore, KH550-modified TiO2 enhanced F-WSFs/PP hierarchical composites has better interfacial bonding properties."

      "text" : "The flexural properties of F-WSFs/PP hierarchical composites containing various\nconcentrations of TiO2 nanoparticles are presented in Figs. 9a-b. It was evident that the flexural strengths and flexural moduli of nano-TiO2 treated composites were superior to the untreated composites. The reason was that nano-TiO2, with high active surface area, increased the interfacial strength between WSFs and PP by adsorbing PP chains and -OH on the surface of WSFs. In addition, nano-TiO2 is endowed with properties like hardness and high modulus and therefore, their inclusion improved the flexural modulus inclusion [30]. An improvement in flexural properties arising from the addition of nano-TiO2 into composites has been reported [49]. Flexural properties were improved by increasing the concentration of either A171modified nano-TiO2 or KH550-modified TiO2. This could be explained on the basis of two facts: the silanol groups absorbed on the surface of nano-TiO2 could react with the -OH on the surface of WSFs to form covalent bonds or hydrogen bonds, and secondly, organosilane molecules were intertwined with PP molecular chains [29,37]. This increased the compatibility between WSFs and PP. There were no obvious differences between the samples incorporated with different concentrations of unmodified nano-TiO2. This could probably be attributed to the relatively larger nanoparticle sizes of pure nano-TiO2 (Fig. 3a). Due to its tendency to form aggregates, it combines poorly with WSFs. Meanwhile, the particle sizes of A171-modified\nnano-TiO2 and KH550-modified nano-TiO2 were smaller (Fig. 3b) than that of unmodified nano-TiO2. Since smaller sized nanoparticles could get easily impregnated into the WSFs, such surface modified nano-TiO2 could react properly with WSFs. Regardless of the percentage loading of surface modified TiO2, no apparent differences in flexural properties between composites treated by A171-modified TiO2 and KH550-modified TiO2 were evident. However, composites treated with 4% KH550-modified TiO2 particles showed maximum improvement in flexural properties. This improvement was due to their reduced particle sizes and relatively homogeneous distribution. The flexural properties of composites treated with 1-4% surface modified TiO2 particles showed improvements. However, at higher nanoparticle concentration, flexural strength was reduced as excess of nano-TiO2 hindered stress transfer from the PP matrix to WSFs, consequently reducing the interfacial strength.\nThe tensile properties of untreated and treated F-WSFs/PP composites are shown in Fig.\n9c. Tensile strength increased gradually from 6.3 MPa to 11.8 MPa with increased loading of unmodified TiO2 particles, albeit with fluctuations at higher loadings. This could be attributed to the concentration of stress caused due to aggregation of unmodified TiO2 particles. In contrast, tensile strengths of samples treated with surface modified TiO2 particles showed an increasing tendency with increase in concentrations of modified TiO2 particles. An exception to this was for the highest concentration of A171-modified or KH550-modified TiO2 particle, probably as large number of particles adsorbed or deposited on the surface of WSFs embrittled the WSFs [47], thereby lowering the tensile strength. F-WSFs-PP composites containing KH550-modified TiO2 particles, particularly with 4% loading, showed the best tensile strength (14.38 MPa) in all composites. This could probably be attributed to a higher interlaced intensity\naccorded by both, reduced particle size and improved distribution of nanoparticles. The mobility of PP chain was efficiently restricted during tensile tests. Furthermore, addition of nanoparticles increased the nucleation rate of the foam, based on the principle of heterogeneous nucleation [17]. Therefore, a more uniform pore structure could enhance the tensile strength of foamed composites. However, in other cases the tensile strength for some TiO2 particle loadings, such as 1% unmodified TiO2, was lower than that of the control groups, again indicating that nanoparticle homogeneity was an important factor for the performance of nanoTiO2.\nThe impact strength of F-WSFs/PP composites with different concentrations of nano-TiO2\nis illustrated in Fig. 9d and their trends were similar to flexural (Fig. 9a) and tensile properties (Fig. 9c). Impact strength increased as the concentration of surface modified nano-TiO2 was increased up to 4%, but declined in case of 5% loading. Such decrease was believed to have resulted from fractures due to excess TiO2, which acted as a discontinuous phase, absorbing energy during impact process. The mechanisms mentioned above could also explain it. The maximum value (4.55 KJ m-2) of impact strength was observed for 4% KH550 modified TiO2 incorporated samples."

      "text" : "The aim of impregnating TiO2 nanoparticles into WSFs was to improve the UV-shielding\nproperties and mechanical strength of F-WSFs/PP hierarchical composites. Nano-TiO2 were surface modified with silane coupling agents, A171 or KH550, and characterized by XRD and FTIR. After surface modification, the particle sizes of nano-TiO2 were relatively reduced and showed lesser variations compared to their pure counterparts, suggesting an improved\ndispersion of TiO2. WSFs were treated with these surface modified TiO2 successfully to obtain F-WSFs/PP hierarchical composites, and the interactions between WSFs and surface modified nano-TiO2 were investigated. SEM analysis indicated that some nanoparticles penetrated into WSFs cells and were also deposited on the fiber surfaces. Samples treated with KH550modified nano-TiO2 exhibited higher UV-shielding property compared to either untreated or A171-modified nano-TiO2. Improvement in mechanical properties was due to the uniform pore structures of hierarchical composites and the good interfacial bonding between the fillers and matrices. Among all types of composite samples prepared, highest mechanical properties were achieved for those treated with KH550-modified nano-TiO2 particles (4 wt%). Notably, results showed that surface modification of TiO2 with coupling agents can enhance the UV-shielding ability and mechanical strength of F-WSFs/PP hierarchical composites."
