Microbial glycoside hydrolases support the enzymatic processing of starch to obtain hydrolyzed starch. Synthesis of hydrolyzed starch/chitosan loaded with CIP (HS/Ch-NC) was carried out via the green ecofriendly method. Characterization analyses of prepared nano-composite were included fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal analysis (TGA and DTGA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope(SEM), mapping and transmission electron microscope (TEM) approved the synthesis of composite in nano-scale in spherical shape with average particle size 291 nm. In vitro drug release study of nano-composite HS/Ch-NC showed a rapid initial release rate was about 86% within 20 h. HS/Ch-NC showed high activity against gram negative bacterial strains due to the successful released of CIP from the HS/Ch-NC into the tested bacterial strains with the lowest concentration, 62.5 and 125 μg/ml for Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. Additionally, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio was observed that the HS/Ch-NC has bacteriostatic effect toward two tested organisms."

      "text" : "Over the past few years, increasing antibiotic resistance among human pathogens necessitates developing new antibiotics or new drug formulations to overcome these problems (Stewart and Costerton, 2001). Many human pathogens are conventional in secondary infections with acute effect pathogenicity especially in immunosuppressed patients. Otherwise, the long-term antibiotics treatment in these pataints is injurious (Borody et al., 2003). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes are the most common human pathogens that cause nosocomial infections with high drug resistance behavior (Velusamy et al., 2016). Nanotechnology has undergone marge different fields including pharmaceuticals, microbiology, infectious diseases and materials science to solve the drug resistance phenomena via nano-composite materials systems (Abdelraof et al., 2019a,b; Bergemann et al., 1999, Hasanin2019a,b; Seil and Webster, 2012; Vellingiri et al., 2013). Moreover, the nano-composites from natural biopolymers origen have high safety profile and it can help in biocompatibility enhancing. Additionally, the controlled drug release systems have many advantages as reduction in dosing frequency and enhanced patient compliance as well as improve the bioavailability\nwhich refers to the degree and rate at which an administered drug is absorbed by the body's circulatory system (Heaney, 2001; Puri et al., 2015). Recently, the composition between the different groups of polysaccharides gives broad characteristics in drug release and carrier systems (Lo et al., 2007; Moghannem et al., 2018). In context, amylose which considered as polysaccharide used as a biomaterial carrier to rifampicin in drug control release system against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Ribeiro et al., 2017). Besides, chitosan is one of the most popular polysaccharide has attracted increased interest due to its extensive application in controlled drug release systems of various therapeutic uses (Vivek et al., 2014). Also, it possess unique characteristics that hold promise in terms of efficacy as drug carriers, with improved drug solubility, stability, bioavailability, and reduced drug toxicity (Nagpal et al., 2013) as well as it possesses many unique properties, including antimicrobial characteristics (Jiang et al., 2010). On the other hand, starch is natural polysaccharide which considered of versatile materials for potential use in polymer technology (Cañigueral et al., 2009; El-Abd et al., 2017). In context, the starch is inexpensive price and a sustainable natural biopolymer (Belhassen et al., 2009). Starch and chitosan are naturally abundant polysaccharides which are generally non-toxic, available from renewable sources, and suitable for film\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2019.100252 Received 13 July 2019; Received in revised form 8 August 2019; Accepted 16 August 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Cellulose & Paper Dept., National Research Centre, El-Buhouth St., Dokki, 12622, Egypt.

Although starch is cheap and easily biodegradable, it is very sensitive to moisture and exhibits poor mechanical properties e.g. Young`s modulus, tensile strength and elongation (Whistler and Daniel, 2000). The blending of starch and chitosan is an alternative way to not only improve the mechanical and water vapor barrier properties, as well as the antimicrobial attributesof starch film but also to reduce the cost and enhance the biodegradability of chitosan film (Bourtoom and Chinnan, 2008). Ciprofloxacin has been proven to be effective against various pathogens that cause clinically common infectious diseases such as chronic osteomyelitis. It is most widely used for bacterial bone infection for most of the Gram negative pathogens bacteria (Maleki Dizaj et al., 2017). Therefore, in the present work, microbial hydrolyzed starch and chitosan are loaded with Ciprofloxacin were prepared by ionic exchange method to improve the drug efficacy and to prolong the acting time of the drug via the prolonged release."

Drug-loaded nano-composite, suspended in 5.0 ml PBS in the dialysis membrane (cutoff: 12 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) tied at both ends and immersed in 100ml of PBS then put into shaker incubator under the condition of 37 °C and 25 rpm (Ji et al., 2011). To determine the concentration of drug in the receiving compartment, samples (5 ml) were withdrawn at scheduled time points and replaced by the same volume of fresh pre-warmed PBS solution to avoid saturation phenomena and maintain the sink condition. Samples were analyzed at 270 nm UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V-630). The release dosage at each moment was calculated and drawn into the cumulative release curve.\n2.2.4.

An antibacterial activity test was carried out using the agar disk method (Takasaka et al., 2017). To perform this assay, sterilized filter paper disks 6mm were placed on Mueller–Hinton agar plates which were already swabbed with test bacteria (McFarland turbidity of 0.5). Paper discs were loaded with 30 μg of HS, Ch., CIP and HS/Ch-NC loaded with ciprofloxacin then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the diameters inhibition (DI) the including diameter of the paper disc (mm) was measured by using a Vernier caliper. The measurement was done in triplicate for each sample.\n2.2.5.2. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. Resazurin is\nan oxidation-reduction indicator used for the evaluation of cell growth (Zheng et al., 2019). It is a blue and non-toxic dye that becomes pink when reduced to resorufin by oxidoreductases within viable cells. Bacterial suspension with standard turbidity of 0.5 Mc Farland was prepared from the liquid culture (Mueller–Hinton broth). Finally, the micro-dilution plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the color change was then assessed visually (Zheng et al., 2019). To each well 10 μl of resazurin indicator solution was added, any color changes from purple to pink or colorless were recorded as positive. The lowest concentration in which color change occurred was taken as the MIC value. MBC value was determinate by sub-culturing bacteria from broth dilution MIC test (unchanged color) into Mueller–Hinton plates at 37 °C for 24 h. MBC was detected by the lowest concentration resulted from\nthe inhibition of the growth on the agar plates (Moon, 2018). The action of HS/Ch-NC as antibacterial activity on selected bacteria can be described by the ratio of MBC/MIC. When the ratio equals to 1 or 2, it means bactericidal effect, and when the ratio is ≥4 or 16 it means, bacteriostatic effects (Moon, 2018)."

The IR bands at 1134 and 1023 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration associated with CeOeC on starch chain (Li et al., 2019). On the other hand, HS/Ch-NC spectrum showed the main features of Ch spectrum as well as some peaks of HS spectrum; mainly in the range (1250–1065 cm−1). No significant changes recorded in the functional groups in loaded HS/Ch-NC toward CIP. These results indicated that no new chemical bonds were formed between these functional groups in drug and nano-composite. It was believed that CIP was trapped within HS/Ch-NC and hence it cannot be detected its peaks in the nano-composite FTIR spectrum and the results confirmed that the drug is physically dispersed in the HS/Ch-NC and it may be released as wild type."

However, the weight loss percent of chitosan was recorded 51% at maximum peak temperature (Tp 242 °C) and HS/Ch-NC recorded 49% at Tp 471 °C.

The diameter of the inhibition zone (DI) for the CIP, CS, HS, and HS/Ch-NC was summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 4a and b. No antibacterial activity was observed with hydrolyzed starch against both bacterial strains. Chitosan showed less inhibitory zone against Enterobacter aerogenes comparing with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The polycationic chitosan charge is associated with the degree of deacetylation. Higher positive charge density leads to strong electrostatic interaction which is an important factor for antibacterial activity (Takahashi et al., 2008). Chitosan binds to the negatively charged bacterial surface and originates agglutination, or an increase of permeability of the microbial wall, that eventually provokes a release of the intracellular components (Helander et al., 2001). It can inhibit mRNA and protein synthesis by binding to the microbial DNA (Takahashi et al., 2008). HS/Ch-NC was the most effective substance retarding microbial growth of all tested pathogenic bacteria at concentration of 1000 μg/ml this may be due to the effect of synergisty."

HS/Ch-NC has shown enhanced antibacterial activity against Enterobacteraer aerogenes more than Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Fig. 5). The enhanced activity was due to the HS, which acts as a stabilizing agent and also acts as a carrier for the Ch. and CIP. Also, this could be due to a polycationic property of HS/Ch-NC with greater surface area and positive surface charge density that enables improved reaction with negatively charged bacterial cell membranes leading to altered cell permeability. The possible antibacterial mechanisms were gain from synergetic effect between the inhibiting DNA gyrase (CIP) (Bearden and Danziger, 2001; Kohanski et al., 2010) and polycationic nature of chitosan which enhanced by converting into nano-sized (Fouad, 2008) leading the bacterial death (Kohanski et al., 2010; Qi et al., 2004).\nMIC and MBC values for HS, Ch. and HS/Ch-NC and CIP were listed in Table 2.

Microbial glycoside hydrolases support the enzymatic processing of starch to obtain hydrolyzed starch. Synthesis of hydrolyzed starch/chitosan loaded with CIP (HS/Ch-NC) was carried out via the green ecofriendly method. Characterization analyses of prepared nano-composite were included fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal analysis (TGA and DTGA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope(SEM), mapping and transmission electron microscope (TEM) approved the synthesis of composite in nano-scale in spherical shape with average particle size 291 nm. In vitro drug release study of nano-composite HS/Ch-NC showed a rapid initial release rate was about 86% within 20 h. HS/Ch-NC showed high activity against gram negative bacterial strains due to the successful released of CIP from the HS/Ch-NC into the tested bacterial strains with the lowest concentration, 62.5 and 125 μg/ml for Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. Additionally, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio was observed that the HS/Ch-NC has bacteriostatic effect toward two tested organisms.",
