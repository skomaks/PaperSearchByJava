      "text" : "A boron-containing SiHfC(N,O) amorphous ceramic was synthesized upon pyrolysis of a single-source-precursor at 1000 °C in Ar atmosphere. The high-temperature microstructural evolution of the ceramic at high temperatures was studied using X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the ceramic consists of an SiHfC(N,O)-based amorphous matrix and finely dispersed sp2-hybridized boron-containing carbon (i.e. ByC). High temperature annealing of ByC/SiHfC(N,O) leads to the precipitation of HfCxN1-x nanoparticles\nJ rn\nal Pr\nas well as to β-SiC crystallization. After annealing at temperatures beyond 1900 ºC, HfB2 formation was observed. The incorporation of boron into SiHfC(N,O) leads to an increase of its sintering activity, consequently providing dense materials possessing improved mechanical properties as compared to those of boron-free SiC/HfC. Thus, hardness and elastic modulus values up to 25.7 ± 5.3 and 344.7 ± 43.0 GPa, respectively, were measured for the dense monolithic SiC/HfCxN1-x/HfB2/C ceramic nano/micro composite.\nKeywords: polymer-derived ceramic nanocomposites; silicon carbide; hafnium carbide; hightemperature; UHTCs"

      "text" : "Boron is a widely used element in the field of advanced ceramics either by forming borides (e.g., HfB2, ZrB2, TiB2, NbB2 and TaB2), BN and B4C with excellent structural/functional properties at high/ultrahigh temperatures [1-3] or by acting as additives/dopants to enhance the thermal stability,[4-7] oxidation resistance,[8, 9] corrosion resistance [10, 11] as well as sintering activity of ceramics.[12-17] For instance, HfB2 and ZrB2 are reported to have unique combination of high melting point (> 3000 ºC), excellent thermal and chemical stabilities, high electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as resistance to erosion/corrosion that makes them suitable for application in harsh environment associated with atmospheric re-entry, hypersonic flight and rocket propulsion.[1, 18-20] In addition, cubic BN, B4C and TiB2 are considered as good candidates for armor or cutting tools due to their excellent mechanical properties.[21-24] Very recently, a promising strategy has been developed by Xiong’s group, i.e., incorporation of some boron into the carbon vacancies of ternary nonstoichiometric carbides (e.g., Zr0.8Ti0.2C1-x) to take advantage of both carbides and borides.[25, 26] For example, the Zr0.8Ti0.2C0.74B0.26 ceramic was demonstrated to exhibit outstanding ablation resistance several times superior than that of ZrC, ZrB2 and their composites at temperatures from 2000 - 3000 ºC.[25] J ur P re\n-p ro\nof\nIn the field of polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs), the enhancement of high-temperature stability [4-6, 27] and resistance to oxidation/corrosion [8, 10, 11] caused by incorporation of boron has been extensively reported as well. In PDCs, the boron is introduced into the ceramics via molecular design of the preceramic precursors, which makes the distribution of boron more homogeneous and consequently the effects of boron more significant.[28-30] In our previous work, a series of dense monolithic SiC/HfC-based ceramic nanocomposites with HfCxN1-x-carbon core shell nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed within the β-SiC matrix have been prepared via a single-source-precursor approach.[31, 32] Using this method, the preceramic precursors can be tailored at the molecular level in order to obtain unique chemical/phase compositions and microstructures and consequently improved properties.[33-35] Thus, SiC/HfC-based ceramic nanocomposites exhibit excellent mechanical property profiles, enhanced laser ablation resistance, tunable electrical conductivity and promising electromagnetic absorbing/shielding efficacy.[32, 36-38] In this work, in order to further improve the structural or functional properties of the SiC/HfC-based ceramics and to study the fate and role of boron in the Si-Hf-C system, a small amount of boron was introduced into the SiC/HfC ceramics using a single-source precursor method. The synthesis process, polymer-to-ceramic transformation, hightemperature microstructural evolution as well as mechanical properties of the boron-containing SiC/HfC dense monoliths were intensively characterized and discussed."

The mass loss, chemical composition and empirical formula of the boron-containing ceramic (i.e., SHBC) after annealing at elevated temperatures are listed in Table 1. The Si, B and Hf content of SHBC-1000ºC were measured using ICP-AES, the remaining contents in the Table 1 were estimated according a constant atomic ratio of Si/Hf/B and the measured C, N and O content. The B and Hf content within the SHBC-1700 ºC sample was also measured using ICP-AES to be 0.57 wt.% and 15.30 wt.%, respectively, which is almost the same as the estimated value in Table 1. Therefore, no significant B and Hf loss occurs during the high-temperature thermal treatment, and the estimation is reliable. A significant mass loss of the SHBC ceramics is detected after annealing of the sample at 1500 °C due to carbothermal reactions with the release of N2 and CO.[31, 41] After the removal of N and O, there was only slight mass loss of the materials, even upon annealing at 1900 °C for 5 h in argon, indicating a promising high-temperature stability of the final product.[31]"

      "text" : "Raman spectra of the SHBC ceramics are shown in Figure 3a, revealing the presence of highly disordered free carbon.[45] The G band is due to stretching vibrations of sp2-carbon in the basalplane of ideal graphitic lattice with E2g-symmetry.[46, 47] The D band is a defect-induced band, which corresponds to a graphitic lattice vibration mode with A1g-symmetry.[45, 48] Accordingly, the intensity ratio of the D band to G band [I(D)/I(G)] may be considered as a measure of the structural disordering of segregated carbon.[31, 36] The I(D)/I(G) value of SHBC-1900ºC (0.82) is almost 3 times higher than that of SHC-1900ºC (0.30), implying the highest disordering of the segregated carbon within the SHBC ceramics.[36] The D' band is also defect-induced but corresponds to a graphitic lattice mode with E2g symmetry.[28, 45, 49] The intensity of D' band in the Raman spectra of SHBC-1700ºC and SHBC-1900°C is significantly higher than that in the spectra of the SHC-1700ºC and SHC-1900ºC (Figure 3c), respectively, clearly indicating that the segregated carbon in SHBC is more disordered than that in SHC ceramics. Several reasons may lead to the increased disordering of the SHBC ceramics. One possible reason is the local structural distortion of the segregated carbon induced by B incorporation into the graphene layers.[28, 50-52] In addition, the higher disordering of the carbon phase in the ceramic nanocomposites prepared at high temperatures (i.e., 1900 °C - this composition reveals the presence of HfB2) may be also a consequence of the formation of HfB2 (upon consumption of carbon), as HfB2 is generated in processes most probably involving the segregated carbon phase in the SHBC ceramics. Thus, as mentioned above, the intensity of the D' band of the SHBC1900ºC decreases as compared with that of SHBC-1700ºC. It is considered that the boroncontaining carbon phase is involved in the conversion of HfCxN1-x into HfB2 (Figure 2).[35]\nInterestingly, the D’ band in the Raman spectrum of SHC-1900ºC disappears, whereas the D' band in the Raman spectrum of SHBC-1900°C still exists (Figure 3c). This may indicate that the boron present in the segregated carbon phase of SHBC-1900°C is not fully consumed upon formation of HfB2. Indeed, based on the elemental analysis of SHBC-1900°C showing a B content of ca. 0.6 wt.% (Table 1) and assuming a full consumption of B to form HfB2, a mass\nJo ur\nna l P\nre -p\noo f\nfraction of HfB2 of ca. 5.6 wt.% is expected in SHBC-1900°C. However, XRD refinement shows that the weight fraction of HfB2 within the SHBC-1900°C is ca. 4.6 wt.% (Table 2), indicating that a small amount of B is still present in the segregated carbon even after annealing at 1900 ºC for 5 h, which is consistent with the Raman results."

      "text" : "Figure 4 shows TEM micrographs of SHBC-1700°C. The SAED patterns reveal the existence of HfCxN1-x and β-SiC, which can be distinguished by their dark and light contrast, respectively. Consistent with the XRD patterns of SHBC-1700°C, no diffraction pattern related to HfB2 can be detected in the SAED. Previously reported TEM images of boron-free SHC ceramics revealed a unique microstructure with HfCxN1-x nano grains encapsulated by an amorphous carbon shell (forming a core-shell structure) embedded homogeneously within the β-SiC matrix.[31, 36] This unique microstructure can also be found in SHBC ceramics synthesized in the present study. Thus, the existence of boron in the amorphous SiHfC(N,O) ceramic does not affect the formation of the HfCxN1-x/a-C core-shell structure. Therefore, two different segregated carbon phases (carbon shell and carbon ribbon) are present within the β-SiC matrix (see Figure 4c and Figure 4d). The carbon ribbons show much higher ordering than that of the carbon shells, which is similar to the situation found in the SHC ceramics.[36] As calculated from the TEM images, the average grain size of the HfCxN1-x nanoparticles in SHBC-1700°C\nJ rn al Pr\n-p ro\nof\nis around 40 nm, which is consistent with the value of ca. 43 nm estimated using XRD Rietveld refinement (Table 2).\nTEM images of SHBC-1900ºC are shown in Figure 5. Although it is hard to identify the HfB2 crystallites in the TEM images, the SAED patterns (Figure 5b) clearly reveal the crystallization of HfB2 and thus agree with the XRD results shown in Figure 2. The carbon shell on the surface of HfCxN1-x grains is still highly disordered (Figure 5c and Figure 5d), which is consistent with\nthe relatively high intensity of the D and D' band in the Raman spectrum of SHBC-1900°C (Figure 3a). The average grain size of the HfCxN1-x nanoparticles is less than 100 nm even after annealing at 1900 °C for 5 h (Figure 5a and Table 2) because the carbon shell highly suppresses the coarsening of the HfCxN1-x nanograins.[31]\nFor comparison, TEM images of the SHC ceramics (without boron) annealed at 1900 ºC for 5 h are shown in Figure 6. The carbon shell and carbon ribbons can be detected as well. It is interesting that the ordering of the carbon shell seems to be higher than that of the SHBC-\n1900°C, and thus some graphene-like layers can be found on the surface of the HfCxN1-x grains (Figure 6b). This finding agrees well with the relatively low I(D)/I(G) value in the Raman spectrum of SHC-1900ºC (Figure 3c). For the boron-containing SiC/HfC ceramics, B is considered to be incorporated into the carbon shell, which retards the graphitization process of the carbon shell even after annealing at 1900 ºC.[53]\nFigure 6 TEM images (bright field) of SiC/HfC ceramics annealed at 1900 °C for 5 h (SHC1900ºC): the dark and light phases in (a) are HfCxN1-x and β-SiC, respectively; (b) is a highresolution TEM image of the HfCxN1-x nanoparticles encapsulated by a graphitic carbon shell.[47]"

The formation of HfB2 indicates that boron was also incorporated into the carbon shell before transferring into the HfB2. The Gibbs free energy change for possible reactions related to the generation of HfB2 at high-temperatures is shown in Figure 8. In all SHBC ceramics, x values of the HfCxN1-x phase are higher than 0.85 (Table 2), which can be considered as a carbon-rich HfCxN1-x phase behaving similarly to stoichiometric HfC. According to the molar Gibbs free energy change of reactions (3) and (4) in Figure 8, the formation of HfB2 upon the reactions between stoichiometric HfC or HfN and B4C are thermodynamically favorable at temperatures even lower than 1000 ºC. However, in our case, the HfB2 cannot be detected even after annealing at 1700 ºC for 5 h, indicating that the boron-containing segregated carbon phase behaves differently than B4C. The Gibbs free energy changes of reactions (1) and (2) in Figure 8 suggest that the formation of HfB2 upon the reactions between stoichiometric HfC or HfN and BN are thermodynamically feasible at temperatures higher than 1900 ºC.

These observations suggest that the dense monolithic SHBS-SPS is a nano/micro composite with HfCxN1-x dispersoids having a wide grain-size range from tens of nanometers to approximately 2.7 micrometers. Moreover, due to the small fraction of HfB2 in SHBC-SPS (< 0.4 wt.%, based on the results of the XRD Rietveld refinement, see Table 2) this phase has not been identified by means of SEM.\nThe SEM images shown in Figure 10a indicate that the SHC-SPS monoliths exhibit relatively large amount of macropores, suggesting sintering issues during the SPS processing (see white arrows). Owing to the strong covalent bonding of both SiC and HfCxN1-x as well as the resulting rather low self-diffusion coefficients of Si and Hf,[61-65] it is hard to densify SiC/HfC ceramics and completely remove the porosity in a short sintering time (20 min) despite the processing temperature is up to 2200 ºC. However, after incorporation of a small amount of boron via the single-source precursor approach, the SHBC-SPS monoliths have a totally different morphology (Figure 10b). No macropores can be found within the cross section of the SHBCSPS samples, indicating that the SHBC-SPS monolith is fully dense and well sintered. Also, the residual open porosity of SHBC-SPS, measured by the water immersion method, was shown to be negligible (≈ 0).\nIn section 3.3.1, the elemental analysis shows that the boron content within the amorphous SHBC-1000ºC is ca. 0.5 wt.%, and after annealing at 1900 ºC (i.e., SHBC-1900ºC) the boron content increases to ca. 0.6 wt.% because of the removal of oxygen and nitrogen (Table 1). That means the boron content within the SHBC-SPS monoliths is expected to be in the range of 0.5 ~ 0.6 wt.%. If boron would be fully consumed to form HfB2, the weight fraction of HfB2 in SHBC-SPS should be ca. 4.6 ~ 5.6 wt.%. However, XRD Rietveld refinement shows that the fraction of HfB2 in SHBC-SPS sample is only ca. 0.4 wt.% (Table 2). Moreover, the boron solubility in SiC is less than 0.2 wt.% even at 2500 °C.[17] Thus, most of the boron should be still located in the segregated carbon within the matrix of the SHBC-SPS monoliths. As reported in the literature, boron and carbon have been used as densification aid for the sintering Jo ur\nn l P\nre -p\nro of\nof SiC.[17] The combination of boron and carbon as sintering aid improves the grain boundary diffusivity (i.e., diffusional mass transport) by reducing the ratio of grain-boundary to surface energy but retains the high-temperature strength with essentially covalent bonds at the grain boundary.[16, 66] A case study was conducted on SiC samples containing 3 wt.% carbon (constant) and 0 ~ 4 wt.% boron.[17] The results suggest that the optimum amount of boron for sintering was 0.2 ~ 0.5 wt.%. Elemental analysis indicates that the free carbon within the boroncontaining SHBC ceramics in the present study is around 4 ~ 6 wt.% (Table 1). Since our single-source-precursor contains boron on the molecular level, a homogeneously dispersed boron-containing carbon phase is in-situ formed during the polymer-to-ceramic conversion process, which obviously acts as an efficient sintering aid to produce fully dense SiC/HfC monoliths."

      "text" : "The representative load-displacement (P-h) curves recorded from Berkovich nanoindentation studies of the SHC-SPS and SHBC-SPS monoliths are displayed in Figure 11. The P-h curves indicate that the stiffness of the SHBC-SPS monolith is slightly higher than that of the corresponding SHC monolith. Based on the load-displacement curves, the hardness (H) and Elastic modulus (E) of the monoliths can be determined using the Oliver-Pharr method.[40, 67, 68] Herein, the Poisson’s ratio of both SHC-SPS and SHBC-SPS monoliths was estimated with a value of 0.17 according to the reported Poisson’s ratio of β-SiC and HfC phases.[69-71] For the diamond Berkovich indenter used in this study, the Ei and vi are 1147 GPa and 0.07, respectively.[40]\nFigure 11 Typical load-displacement (depth) curves obtained from the nanoindentation experiments with the monolithic SHC-SPS and SHBC-SPS samples. Jo\nur\nna l P\nre -p\nro of\nFigure 12 Histograms of the frequency distribution of the hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) obtained from 100 nanoindentation tests on the SHC-SPS and SHBC-SPS monoliths.\nJo ur\nna l P\nre\n-p\nro of\nFigure 12 shows the frequency distribution of the hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) of the SHC-SPS and SHBC-SPS monoliths obtained from the nanoindentation tests. The scatter of the H and E values of both monoliths are caused most likely by microstructural inhomogeneities within the materials (e.g., clusters of segregated carbon or pores, and variation of the grain sizes of HfCxN1-x particles from nanometers to micrometers as mentioned in section 3.4).[38, 72] The average H and E values of the SHC-SPS and SHBC-SPS were calculated to be 25.6 ± 4.9 GPa, 324.5 ± 47.6 GPa and 25.7 ± 5.3 GPa, 344.7 ± 43.0 GPa, respectively. The hardness and elastic modulus of both monoliths are comparable to each other, indicating that the mechanical properties of the SiC/HfC ceramics are not significantly influenced by the presence of small amounts of boron, despite that the grain sizes of both β-SiC and HfCxN1-x are considerably increased (Table 2). Moreover, the nanoindentation tests show that the mechanical properties of SHBC-SPS samples are much better than those of previously reported polymer-derived dense monoliths, such as SiOC (H ≈ 5 ~ 11 GPa, E ≈ 50 ~ 108 GPa),[73, 74] SiCN (H ≈ 13 GPa, E ≈ 121),[72] SiBCN (H ≈ 17 GPa and E ≈ 172 GPa),[75] SiC (H ≈ 14 GPa, E ≈ 122 GPa),[76] Si3N4/TiN (H ≈ 20, E ≈ 171 GPa),[77] and SiC/α-Al2O3 (H ≈ 12 GPa, E ≈ 154 GPa).[78] The excellent mechanical properties prove that incorporation of sintering aids using a single-source-\nJo ur na l P\nepr\noo f\nprecursor approach followed by consolidation via spark plasma sintering is an advanced strategy for the fabrication of dense monolithic SiC/UHTCs (nano)composites for practical applications."

      "text" : "Boron-containing SiC/HfC ceramic nano/micro composites, including powdered samples and dense monoliths, have been prepared successfully using a single-source-precursor approach. In the synthesis step, BH3·SMe2 and Hf(NEt2)4 was used to react with the Si-polymer SMP10 via hydroboration and substitution reactions, respectively, leading to the formation of B- and Hfcontaining single-source precursor. Subsequent thermolysis of the synthesized preceramic polymers resulted in ceramic materials in the Si-Hf-B-C-N system. Microstructural characterization demonstrated that boron was incorporated in the free carbon phase in-situ formed during the pyrolysis process. After annealing at elevated temperatures beyond 1900 °C, the boron-containing carbon reacted with HfCxN1-x to form HfB2. Moreover, the in situ formed boron-containing free carbon phase is considered to act as an effective sintering aid and remarkably enhanced the densification capability of the SiC/HfC nano/micro composites under SPS conditions. The improved densification of the samples resulted in excellent mechanical properties with respect to hardness and Young´s modulus, which exceed those reported for other polymer-derived ceramic nanocomposites."

The high-temperature microstructural evolution of the ceramic at high temperatures was studied using X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the ceramic consists of an SiHfC(N,O)-based amorphous matrix and finely dispersed sp-hybridized boron-containing carbon (i.e. ByC). High temperature annealing of ByC/SiHfC(N,O) leads to the precipitation of HfCxN1-x nanoparticles J rn al Pr epr oo f",
