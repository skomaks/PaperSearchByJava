Herein, we report the preparation of hierarchical titanate nanostructures (HTNs) by a in situ chemical conversion strategy using a two-dimensional MXene crystal precursor. These HTNs are very stable and can efficiently remove Eu(III) with large sorption capacities, owing to well-maintained layered structures and abundantly exchangeable guest cations. The replacement of sodium or potassium ions with Eu(III) in HTN interlayers has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The extended X-ray sorption fine structure (EXAFS) results, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, further indicate that the sequestration of Eu(III) is realized by forming inner-sphere surface complexes in nano-confined space, evidenced by the decrease of Eu-O distances (R) and coordination numbers (N). The finding of the innersphere complexation induced by Ti−O/Ti−OH coordination and confinement effect provides new insights into the interaction mechanism between radionuclides and titanates. Given their extraordinary sorption capacity and facile synthesis under mild conditions, these HTNs are promising candidates for the efficient removal of trivalent lanthanides and actinides from aqueous solutions during the cleanup of radioactive pollution in the environment.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.03.286 Received 23 February 2019; Received in revised form 29 March 2019; Accepted 30 March 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "With the unceasing utilization of nuclear energy, nuclear industry activities such as mining, nuclear weapon and electricity production, and spent fuel reprocessing, have led to ever-increasing amounts of nuclear waste [1]. Thus, there is a great demand for safe management and disposal of radioactive wastes from the viewpoint of environmental protection [2]. To avoid potential radioactive contamination in soil and surrounding water nearby legacy nuclear facilities, effective separation of nuclear waste and efficient remediation of radionuclides are of crucial importance. In particular, the removal of actinides with long halflife [3] (such as Np, Pu, Am, and Cm) has become a challenging environmental issue in nuclear-waste management [4].\nPresently, one promising method for radionuclide sequestration is solid-phase extraction using ideal adsorbents, which is recognized to be a simple, effective and environmentally friendly technique. These adsorbents transfer the radioactive content of large volumes of liquid to small volumes of solid through ion-exchange and/or other sorption modes, which effectively reduces the risk to the environment and the entire biosphere. Over the past few decades, a variety of inorganic layered ion exchangers have been used as adsorbents for the removal of these radionuclides, including montmorillonite [5,6], clay minerals [7,8], synthetic micas [9], and magadiites [10]. These ion exchangers immobilize target cations into layered structures in an inexpensive manner [11]. However, they are often limited in their applications due to some drawbacks that are difficult to overcome, such as low sorption capacities, easy interference by other ions, instabilities in acidic solutions, poor selectivities, and slow dynamics.\nIn recent years, titanate nanomaterials [12–20] have been widely used in the environmental-remediation field due to their high sorption efficiencies and effective radionuclide immobilization capability. Spectroscopic analyses in the literature [13–16,18,20] reveal that such excellent sorption performance was mainly ascribed to ion exchange between the radionuclides and the exchangeable Na+/H+ ions located in the interlayers of titanate materials. Sheng et al. reported that the sorption of Eu(III) on titanate nanotubes was pH- and temperaturedependent [15,20]. Li et al. [12] also found that concentrated alkali played a very important role in the conversion of P25 into titanate nanostructures. By adjusting the concentration of the base, they obtained a layered titanate material with a larger specific surface area and more free water between layers, which enhanced the ion-exchange capacity. However, this chemical conversion route usually requires a large amounts of concentrated alkali (10M or greater) and high hydrothermal temperature [12–20], which is not cost-effective and ecofriendly. On the other hand, the intensive confinement of molecules or ions in nanoscale space can be expected to provide extraordinary trends or properties in aqueous interface chemistry due to the explicit anomaly of their hydration [21,22]. From this perspective, layered titanate nanostructures are ideal models for investigating the effect of space restricting on sorption species of radionuclide ions, since they are mostly composed of TiO6 octahedra with strong in-plane bonding and weak van der Waals-like interactions between neighboring layers [23]. Although a lot of effort has been devoted to investigate the interaction mechanism between radionuclides and surface of nano-titanates, the effect of space confinement on the local atomic structures of radionuclide ions inside titanate interlayers has rarely been explored.\nHerein, we use Ti2CTx MXene, a fascinating two-dimensional graphene-like crystal [24–28], as the precursor for the preparation of MXene-derived hierarchical titanate nanostructures (HTNs). Benefiting from the high reactivity of Ti2CTx and in situ oxidation conversion strategy (Scheme 1), HTNs can be easily synthesized under a mild condition (1M NaOH/KOH, 150 °C), which greatly reduces alkali pollution in the material production. Two flower-like samples (referred to as “Na-HTNs” and “K-HTNs”) were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy/transmission electron microscope/\nenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/TEM/EDS), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nDue to their unique layered structures, uniform morphologies, and large specific surface areas, Na-HTNs and K-HTNs are expected to have good uptake performance toward radionuclides. In this paper, Eu(III) was chosen as a chemical analogue of trivalent lanthanides and actinides [15,29,30] to survey the radionuclide sequestration. Importantly, our study highlights the confinement of Eu(III) ions in nanoscale interlayers of HTNs via EXAFS analyses and DFT calculations (Scheme 1). This work also suggests that MXene-derived HTNs are promising candidates for environmental cleanup of radioactive pollution from aqueous solutions."

      "text" : "Sorption experiments were carried out under ambient conditions (T= 25 ± 0.1 °C) using batch techniques. The effects of pH, ionic strength, and initial concentrations of Eu(III) on the sorption were studied at an HTNs sorbent dosage of 0.2 g/L in 20mL polyethylene tubes. Briefly, HTNs were pre-equilibrated with water or NaClO4 solution (0.01–0.6M) for 12 h, after which a stock solution of Eu(III) were gradually spiked into the suspension. The pH of solution was adjusted mildly using small amounts of HNO3 or NaOH. The suspensions were then shaken for 24 h to ensure sorption equilibrium (preliminary experiments determined that this period was sufficient to equilibrate these suspensions). During the sorption process, variations in pH were all less than± 0.1. The solid and liquid phases were separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 30min, after which the supernatants were collected for the following concentration determination. Eu(III)containing HTNs were washed with a small amount of deionized water to remove unsorbed cations and then were characterized. The effect of\npH on Eu(III) sorption by HTN was examined over a pH range of 2.0–10.0. Sorption isotherms were acquired at pH 4.0 within the 20–300mg/L concentration range. To eliminate the effect of cation sorption on the walls of the polycarbonate tubes, the cation-sorption experiments were carried out in the absence of an adsorbent under the same experimental conditions. Finally, concentrations of Eu(III) ions in the solution were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Horiba JY2000-2, Japan) and the limit of detection (LOD) for Eu(III) is 0.01mg/L. All samples were diluted to range of 1–5mg/L by 5wt% HNO3 before the measurements. The removal efficiency (E, %) and sorption capacity (Qe, mg/g) of metal ions were calculated according to the following equations:\n= − ∗E C C C( )/ 100%e0 0\n= − ∗Q C C m V( )/e e0\nwhere C0 and Ce represent the initial and equilibrium concentrations (mg/L) of Eu(III) ions in aqueous phase, respectively; m and V designate the weight (g) of the HTNs and the solution volume (L), respectively."

The space group of Pmma was finally assigned to the orthorhombic crystal Na2Ti2O4(OH)2. Based on the optimized model, Pawley refinement was done with the Reflex module to iteratively optimize the lattice parameters until the Rwp and Rp values converge and the observed profile fits well with the refined one. The coordination of Eu within the inter-layer confined space was also simulated and the electron exchange correlation energy was calculated with the GGA-PBE [34] functional implemented in VASP 5.4 [35]. A plane-wave cutoff of 400 eV and the Gaussian electron smearing method with σ=0.05 eV were used. During all the simulations, the Eu 5s25p64f76s2 valence electrons were treated explicitly.

      "heading" : "3.1. Characterization of Na-HTNs and K-HTNs",
      "text" : "The morphology of HTNs was examined by SEM and TEM. Compared to the accordion-like multilayered nanostructure of Ti2CTx MXene precursor (as shown in Fig. S1), Na-HTNs and K-HTNs are composed of uniform flower-like microspheres with diameters less than 1 μm (Fig. 1A and D). TEM images (Fig. 1B–F) further confirmed that these hierarchical microspheres were well assembled from many elongated nanoribbons with a size of 5–20 nm in width. Na-HTNs have looser structures compared to K-HTNs, mainly because the nanoribbons\non its surface were more straight and wider. The crystal structures of Na-HTNs and K-HTNs were then characterized by XRD. All the diffraction peaks (Fig. 1G) match well with the orthorhombic phase Na2/K2Ti2O4(OH)2, [36,37] which is composed of edge-sharing TiO6 octahedra layers and intercalated Na or K cations. In order to better identify the detailed structures of HTNs, structural modeling of Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 (Fig. 1H) was carried out. The fitted lattice parameters are calculated as: a= 3.78, b= 3.10 and c= 17.20 Å, which are very close to those reported by Xie et al. [37]. Fig. 1G also indicates that the simulated PXRD pattern agrees well with the experimental data. Based on this structural model, the diffraction peaks at 10.28/10.85°, 24.3/24.4°, 28.4/28.8° and 48.3/47.9° for Na2/ K2Ti2O4(OH)2 can be assigned to the lattice planes (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 3) and (2 0 0), respectively. The c lattice parameter of K-HTNs\n(16.30 Å) was smaller than that of Na-HTNs, probably due to the different radius and hydration of interlayer Na and K ions. In addition, the molar ratios of Na to Ti in Na-HTNs were determined to be around 1:1 by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement (Supplementary data); and the Raman spectrum in Fig. S2A demonstrate the presence of Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 in Na-HTNs, as indicated by Na-O-Ti stretching at 279 cm−1 and 446 cm−1, Ti-O-Ti stretching in TiO6 octahedra at 705 cm−1, and symmetric stretching of short Ti-O mode (oxygen atom not connected to sodium ions) at 905 cm−1 [38,39]. These results are consistent with the previous structural assignment of Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 for Na-HTNs. Similar result of K-HTNs was also seen in Fig. S2A.\nThe BET specific surface areas of Na-HTNs and K-HTNs were measured as 184 and 347m2/g (Fig. S2B), respectively, which are much larger than that of titanate nanofibers or comparable with titanate nanotubes. TG measurement was also performed on Na-HTNs and KHTNs to evaluate their thermal stability and interlayer water content (Fig. S3). In particular, Na-HTNs and K-HTNs lose weight mainly between 50 and 150 °C, indicating the presence of interlayer water, which can be easily removed at lower temperatures. Fig. S3 shows another weight-loss process for HTNs at the temperature range of 250–320 °C, which may be ascribed to the dehydration of intercalated ions and dehydroxylation of –TiOH [37]. Clearly, there are more interlayer water inside Na-HTNs than in K-HTNs, which is in accordance with the larger interlayer space of Na-HTNs resulted from higher hydration energy and bigger hydration radius of Na ions [40,41]. The accommodation of a large number of interlayer water molecules may facilitate the fast transport and diffusion of exchangeable cations inside Na-HTNs [42], as such a good ion-exchange performance can be expected."

      "text" : "Fig. 2A display the kinetics profiles for the sorption of Eu(III) onto the HTNs at pH 4. The sorption of Eu(III) was observed to increase with increasing contact time over the first 4 h, and then gradually reached equilibrium. The amount of Eu(III) adsorbed by Na-HTNs is larger than that of K-HTNs, showing clearly its superior adsorptivity and ion-exchange capacity. According to the XRD and TGA results mentioned above, it is reasonable to suggest that the excellent sorption performance of Na-HTNs is attributed to its large interlayer space and high hydration energy of Na+, which can promote the diffusion and exchange of Eu(III). Typically, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-secondorder rate models were used to fit the Eu(III) sorption kinetics. As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1, the Eu(III) sorption kinetics for each HTN was well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R2 > 0.999) compared to the pseudo-first-order model (R2 < 0.91), indicating a chemisorption process that well reported in previous studies [13]."

As shown in Fig. 2B, the sorption of Eu(III) by the HTNs increased significantly as the pH increased from 2.0 to 6.0, with higher sorption observed at pH > 7.0. To rationalize the pH-dependent sorption behavior, zeta-potentials of HTNs were determined as shown in Fig. S5, which reveal that the HTN surfaces are positively charged at lower pH and become negatively charged at pH > 3.85. The main species at pH < 6.0 (as shown in Fig. S6), namely Eu3+, are attached to the negatively charged HTN surfaces through electrostatic attraction. When\nthe pH increases, the HTN surfaces become more negatively charged and the concentration of competitive protons decreases, resulting in enhanced sorption of Eu(III). The removal percentage of Eu(III) by HTNs is close to 100% at pH > 7.0, which is ascribable to the precipitation of Eu(OH)3(s) (Fig. S6)."

      "heading" : "3.4. Sorption isotherms and the effect of ionic strength",
      "text" : "The effect of ionic strength on Eu(III) sorption by the HTNs is illustrated in Fig. 2C, the results show that the Eu(III) adsorbed decreases while the ionic strength is increased. It’s well-known that ion exchange is very sensitive to ionic strength, whereas inner-sphere complexation is scarcely affected [43,44]. The dependence of uptake capacity on ionic strength implies that Eu(III) sorption onto the HTNs had experienced an ion exchange process [43,44]. The decline of Eu adsorbed may result from the competition of Na+/K+ with Eu(III) for ion-exchange sites.\nSorption isotherms were determined to understand the interactions operating between Eu(III) and the HTNs, the results of which are shown in Fig. 2D. It is found that the amounts of Eu(III) adsorbed by the two HTNs (Na-HTNs and K-HTNs) increase with increasing equilibrium concentration. The sorption isotherms were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich models in order to provide a better understand of the interaction mechanism. Further fitting details are provided in the Supplementary data. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2, the Eu(III) sorption data are well fitted by the Langmuir model (R2 > 0.99). The maximum Eu(III) sorption capacities for Na-HTNs and K-HTNs (at pH 4.0 and T=298 K), as calculated using the Langmuir model, are 221.7 and 202.8 mg/g, respectively. The sorption capacities of the HTNs is significantly higher than those of other nanomaterials (Table S3), which further reveals superior adsorptivity of the MXene-derived titanates toward Eu(III)."

      "heading" : "3.5. Spectroscopic analysis",
      "text" : "Spectroscopic (XRD, FT-IR and XPS) analysis were further performed to understand the sorption mechanism of Eu(III) on HTNs. XRD patterns of HTNs before and after Eu(III) sorption at different temperatures and/or drying conditions are shown in Fig. 3. The characteristic (0 0 2) peaks, which corresponds to the c lattice parameter or d-spacing [45], shift obviously at various conditions, suggesting the intrinsic guest ion and/or molecule transport inside interlayers of HTNs. The hydration effect has been considered by immersing dry HTNs into water, and the corresponding XRD patterns are very similar to the HTNs samples dried at room temperature. With the same experimental conditions (wet or dried at 353 K), HTNs samples exhibit apparent d-spacing increase after Eu(III) uptake. It is assumed that the\nsmaller-radius Na+ or K+ ions were replaced by target cations with much larger radii, i.e. Eu(III) (including Eu3+ and EuOH2+; Fig. S6), thus swelled the HTN-interlayer. We note that some Na2Ti3O7 titanate sorbents show decreasing d-spacing after metal ion capture [12,46], which is contrary to our results probable due to the structural difference of various titanate. Divalent or trivalent metal ions generally prefer to occupy the corner positions in zigzag stepped Na2Ti3O7 [46], resulting in collapse of the interlayer space. Since body-centered orthorhombic Na2Ti2O4(OH)2/K2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanosheet consists of extended edgesharing TiO6 octahedral and there is no corner position on the plane, the introduction of Eu ions can only cause the swelling of Na-HTNs/KHTNs interlayers. Wet Na-HTNs-Eu has a larger d-spacing than wet KHTNs-Eu (10.50 Å vs 9.55 Å), suggesting the accommodation of more Eu(III) ions in Na-HTNs interlayers. It is noteworthy that the d-spacing of Na-HTNs is more affected by the humidity or temperature compared with that of K-HTNs, implying its higher affinity for binding to water molecules. After dried at 353 K, both Na-HTNs-Eu and K-HTNs-Eu have similar (0 0 2) peaks centered at 10.0°, which are different from that of Na-HTNs or K-HTNs, indicating that most of Na+ or K+ ions has been exchanged by Eu3+ ions. As such the characteristic peak at 2θ of 10.0° is attributed to the successful incorporation of Eu3+ ions into the HTNs interlayers. In addition, the characteristic (2 0 0) peaks (i.e. a lattice parameters) for all samples have no obvious changes, which indicates that the units of [TiO6] octahedral layers in HTNs are very stable in the sorption process.\nFig. 4A and Table S4 show FT-IR spectra and data of the HTNs before and after Eu(III) sorption. The broad intense bands at 3404 and 3389 cm−1 are ascribed to characteristic hydroxyl-group vibrations from water [47] and surface Ti-OH, respectively, and the peaks at 1631 and 1624 cm−1 are assigned to H-O–H bending vibrational modes of water.[15,48] Obvious shifts in these peaks were observed after Eu(III) sorption, which is indicative of changeable interactions involving hydrogen bonding between intercalated water molecules and the free titanium hydroxyls on the surfaces of the lamellar structures. In addition, the peaks of Na-HTNs/K-HTNs at 1338/1335 cm−1, corresponding to Ti-OH bending vibrations [18], were observed to shift to 1384/ 1377 cm−1, respectively. These notable redshifts further confirm that the titanium hydroxyl groups located between the layers and the surfaces play important roles during the sorption process. Importantly, the Na-HTNs/K-HTNs peaks at 902.5/902.1 cm−1 (see Fig. 4A) are ascribed to stretching vibrations of non-bridging oxygen atoms that are coordinated with Na or K ions [49,50]. After Eu(III) sorption, a blueshift of 21.2/19.5 cm−1 (shift to 881.3/882.6 cm−1 following Eu(III) sorption) was observed due to the replacement of the Na+/K+ in the -ONa/ K groups by Eu3+.\nSurvey XPS spectra of the HTNs before and after Eu(III) sorption are\ndisplayed in Fig. 4B, which confirms the presence of Na/K, O, Ti in pristine HTNs and the successful loading of Eu(III) on the exhausted HTN samples. As shown in Fig. S8 A and B, the Na 1s and K 2p peaks in high resolution XPS spectra observed in pristine HTN samples almost disappeared upon sorption of Eu(III) ions. Meanwhile, four Eu 3d peaks for the Eu(III) loaded samples emerged (Fig. S8C and Table 1), in which spectra at 1135.1 and 1164.6 eV are assigned to Eu 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin states, and accompanied by satellite peaks at 1125.8 and 1155.2 eV, respectively, which is consistent with previous study [51]. The replacement of Na/K by Eu is also evidenced by EDS (Fig. S9).\nInterestingly, the available data show that the peaks at 532.0 and 530.0 eV for O 1s (Fig. 4C and Table 1) correspond to the oxygens of hydroxyl groups bonded to metals (MOH) and crystal-lattice oxygens [TiO6] [52], respectively. Upon Eu(III) sorption, those peaks at 530.0 eV for both Na-HTNs and K-HTNs are observed to shift to 530.4 eV, and the spin-orbit splitting [18] of the Ti 2p components of Na-HTNs and K-HTNs (Fig. 4D and Table 1) at 458.4/464.2/471.6 eV are observed to shift to 458.8/464.6/472.0 eV correspondingly. Accordingly, the identical shifts of 0.4 eV to higher binding energies imply that basic [TiO6] units are partly involved in a surface complexation\nwith Eu(III). Additional, the corresponding spin-energy separations (5.8 eV) [19] were not changed at all after sorption, implying their similar spatial arrangements and good stability of the skeleton titanates structures [19]."

This results clearly suggest that the Eu(III) sorption onto the HTN surfaces involved a typical non-reductive sorption process, which is in agreement with the XPS results.\nThe local coordination environments of Eu(III) in the HTNs were further analyzed and analyses of the europium LIII-edge EXAFS spectra of the Eu-loaded HTNs at pH 4 are provided in Fig. 5, with the fitted parameters summarized in Table 2. Compared to the standard Eu(aq) sample, an overall shift of oscillation periods at k > 4 Å−1 for the Euloaded HTNs were observed (Fig. 5A), which highlights the changing\nTable 1 Binding Energies of the HTNs before and after sorption.\nadsorbents O 1s (eV) Ti 2p (eV) Eu 3d (eV)\nTi-O6 Ti-O-Eu Ti 2p 3/2 Ti 2p 1/2 satellite satellite Eu3d 5/2 satellite Eu3d 3/2\nNa-HTNs 530.0 – 458.4 464.2 471.6 – – – – K-HTNs 530.0 – 458.4 464.2 471.6 – – – – Na-HTNs-Eu 530.4 532.0 458.8 464.6 472.0 1125.8 1135.1 1155.2 1164.6 K-HTNs-Eu 530.4 532.0 458.8 464.6 472.0 1126.0 1135.4 1155.2 1164.6\ncoordination environments of the Eu aquo-complexes on the HTN surfaces. The results of corresponding Fourier transform (FT) reveal that the Eu-loaded HTNs had a single broad peak at 2.39–2.40 Å, which is resulted from O backscatter in the first coordination shells (Eu-O) [15]. The fitted coordination numbers of Eu−O for Na-HTNs and K-HTNs are 7.4 and 8.1, respectively. It is believed that Eu(III) hydrated ions are first exchanged into the interlayers, and then they exhibit strong affinities with [TiO6] octahedral in a confined space, so that the distances of Eu-O and the fitted value of coordination numbers for the Eu-loaded HTNs were all declining compared to the Eu(aq) (r= 2.43 Å, N=9.0). On the other hand, the decreasing Eu−O coordination number implies more 4f-orbital unoccupancy, thus resulting the increases in energy which leads to more intense satellites and larger IAR (as seen the XPS results in Table S5, compared to that of Eu(NO3)3 (0.13) [51]). Furthermore, a Ti atom at distance> 4 Å (Table 2) was fitted in the second coordination shells of Eu, indicating that Eu(III) and their hydrates form inner-sphere surface complexes on surface of HTNs.[15,29]\nSince it was difficult to distinguish the Eu-O bonds formed within the hydration sphere and those with oxygen atoms at the surface by distances [52], we here simulated the coordination of Eu within the interlayer confined space by density functional theory (DFT). Eu(III) in interfacial sorption configuration was also simulated for comparison. The most stable sorption structures after geometry optimization were shown in Fig. 6(A, B) and their structure parameters were listed in Tables S6 and S7. The results showed that, in the HTNs interlayer, the Eu(III) preferred to bond to two titanium hydroxyl groups located on the surfaces of two adjacent [TiO6] octahedral layers. The coordination number and averaged distance of surface coordinated Eu−O for interlayer configuration are six and 2.371 Å, respectively, which are significantly lower than those for experimental Eu(aq) (N= 9.0, r= 2.43). As a comparison, although the interface configuration (Fig. 6A) has a declining coordination number of seven, the averaged distance of Eu−O (r= 2.446 Å) is comparable or slightly longer than that for Eu(aq). Therefore, it is concluded that the space confinement effect inside HTNs interlayers can dramatically enhanced the\ninteraction between Eu(III) and [TiO6] octahedral layers. The simulated results of configuration in Fig. 6B were also consistent with the experimental fitting data (Table 4), which confirmed the formation of inner-sphere complexation in a confined space during sorption in HTNs [29,51–53].\nAs discussed above, a comprehensive mechanism for Eu(III) sorption on HTNs was proposed. Briefly, Eu(III) sorption proceeded firstly by ion-exchange processes [15,47,51], during which H+/Na+/K+ was replaced by Eu(III) through stronger hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction. Once Eu(III) hydrated ions were exchanged into the layers of the HTNs, they were confined and then combined with the Ti−O/Ti−OH groups from two adjacent [TiO6] octahedral layers, thereby resulting the decline of coordination number (N) and shorter Eu−O. As a consequence, the nuclide ions could be more easily adsorbed into the negative confinement layers and then immobilized between the HTNs layers."

      "text" : "In conclusion, an in-situ oxidation conversion strategy was used to obtain two MXene-derived hierarchical titanate nanostructures (HTNs) under a mild condition (1M NaOH, 150 °C). The as-prepared HTNs are very stable and can efficiently remove Eu(III) in the aqueous phase. The uptake of Eu(III) occurred in the confined space between the layers of HTNs, in which filled with large amount of free water and abundant surface hydroxyl groups, and much more H+/Na+/K+ could be easily combined or introduced thus provide more active ion-exchange sites. During sorption, these active sites are exchanged with Eu(III) hydrated ions through stronger hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction, which resulted in the large sorption. Importantly, EXAFS analyses and DFT calculations confirm that Eu(III) ions are confined in nanoscale interlayers of HTNs with the form of inner-sphere complexation, and then easily immobilized between the layers. These HTNs, are expected to become superior materials for the sorption and immobilization of radionuclides during the cleanup of radioactive pollution in the\nenvironment."
