      "text" : "Supercapacitors (SCs) have been widely developed as energy storage devices because of their unique characteristics in terms of energy and power densities, and the ability to store higher energy densities than traditional capacitors and reach higher power densities than batteries makes SCs ideal for applications requiring quick bursts of energy, for instance, portable electronics, high power electronic devices, and hybrid electric vehicles.1−7 On the basis of the formula E = 1/2CV2, the energy density (E) of a SC is dependent on the specific capacitance (C) and cell potential window (V). Improving C and enlarging V, which are governed by the intrinsic properties of the electrodes and electrolytes,8 are extremely essential for achieving a SC with high performance. Therefore, designing and fabricating novel electrode materials are of vital significance but face enormous challenges.9−11 The energy storage of SCs comes from two mechanisms.12 One is a nonFaradaic process (double-layer capacitance), and the other is a Faradaic process (pseudocapacitance). According to the kinds of electrode materials applied to SCs, these two mechanisms\ncan work independently or collaboratively.12 Electrode materials for electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are composed of carbon materials that possess high surface area and superior electrical conductivity (e.g., carbon films/textiles, graphene, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, and so on).13 However, carbonaceous materials also have some drawbacks like low specific capacitance and poor energy density. Electrode materials for charge-transfer-reaction pseudocapacitors are composed of transition-metal oxides (e.g., RuO2, MnO2) and conducting polymers, which usually exhibit excellent specific capacitance and energy density but inferior power density and cycling ability.8,14 Thus, integrating electrode materials with double-layer capacitive and pseudocapacitive features in one system can combine both advantages and can even be accompanied with synergistic effects, which\nReceived: February 26, 2019 Accepted: April 23, 2019 Published: April 23, 2019\n© 2019 American Chemical Society 2934 DOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl.

Electrodes with IPC properties possess the optimal characteristics of both batteries (superior energy density) and SCs (excellent power density).15−17 Just recently, vanadium oxides and their derivative materials have attracted much attention as promising IPC electrode materials, where the Faradaic process is used to transfer ions embedded in the tunnels or layers of redox-active materials without ion-diffusion restriction and a crystal-phase transition.17−20 For years, vanadium oxides (e.g., V2O5 and VO2 with multifarious structures and morphologies) have been extensively used in energy storage systems because of not only their high availability, low price, and ability to survive in variable valence states but also their really large potential window and high energy density.21−26 Nevertheless, vanadiumbased oxyhydroxides have rarely been investigated, yet may exhibit strikingly promising scientific properties in electrochemistry.27 Up to now, only Haggite V4O6(OH)4\n28 and Duttonite [vanadium oxyhydroxide, VO(OH)2]\n29 have been reported. VO(OH)2 is composed of chains of distorted octahedra VO2(OH)4 sharing edges. To synthesize VO(OH)2 via aqueous precipitation, the pH was adjusted to 4.0, which is very fastidious and unmanageable. Very recently, VO(OH)2 was syn thes i z ed wi th the a s s i s t ance o f po ly - (vinylpyrrolidone).30 Both works29,30 studied its electrochemical properties and demonstrated that it could store energy by an intercalation/deintercalation process (IPC feature). However, its electrochemical properties are severely plagued by dissolution, inferior structure durability, and high impedance. Thus, this work will focus on improvement of the electrochemical performance of VO(OH)2 in its application as an IPC material, which is essentially urgent and valuable for breaking new ground for VO(OH)2 materials. Adding conducting materials with superior stable structures\nis a feasible strategy to optimizing the electrochemical performance of the electrodes.31−33 Graphene oxide (GO),\n2D macromolecular sheets of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms with a honeycomb structure, has been considered to be a nextgeneration carbonaceous material for SCs.31,34,35 However, because GO materials are susceptible to restacking in solution because of strong π−π interactions between the basal planes of the graphene sheets and the absence of sufficient large pores for easy penetration of the electrolyte ions, the direct application of GO to SC applications has been hindered.31 Previous studies show that carbonaceous materials are widely applied for hybridization with vanadium oxides as SCs’ electrodes.36−38 Hence, a binary composite of VO(OH)2 combined with GO networks is expected to emerge, which amalgamates the superiorities of each component. Herein, a 3D VO(OH)2 nanoflake wrapped with reduced GO [3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite] is synthesized by a onestep hydrothermal strategy. Because of the synergistic effects of different components, the electrochemical properties of 3D VO(OH)2/rGO have been considerably improved. The assembled flexible VO(OH)2/rGO symmetric SC (SSC) device has a wide potential range of up to 2.4 V with an impressive energy density of 56.26 Wh·kg−1 at 104.16 W·kg−1, which is satisfied and is promising for practical applications."

      "text" : "2.1. Composition, Structure, and Morphology of VO(OH)2/rGO. The electrode material 3D VO(OH)2/rGO was synthesized by simple solution processes, as is schematically depicted in Figure 1a. 2D GO nanosheets were synthesized by a modified Hummer’s route.38,39 The synthesized GO contains lots of functional groups, which provides sites for condensation of VO(OH)2 during the addition of a sodium hydroxide solution.40 First, VO2+ was anchored on the functional GO surface. According to previous exploration,30 the regulation of pH to 4.7 is the decisive condition for the synthesis of VO(OH)2. Second, the hydrothermal treatment further promotes the growth and formation of VO(OH)2 nanaflakes on the GO surface through Ostwald ripening. In the meantime, GO is reduced to rGO by a small amount of V4+ discussed below, which ensures the high conductivity of the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite. 39 Thus,\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2935\nVO(OH)2 nanoflakes wrapped with rGO nanosheets are yielded and stack together to form a 3D interlaced network. In such an integrated composite, the simultaneous assembly of nanoflakes on rGO nanosheets facilitates the prevention of restacking of rGO nanosheets.41 The presence of rGO nanosheets with good electrical conductivity facilitates electron transport in a 3D porous VO(OH)2/rGO composite, as described in Figure 1b. The electrons can access the VO(OH)2 nanoflakes quickly when they reach the rGO nanosheets, and thereby the conductivity of 3D VO(OH)2/rGO is improved. 41 The above inference is proven by the improved electrochemical performance of the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite electrode material. Figure 2 displays the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; parts a−c) and transmission elelctron\nmicroscopy (TEM; parts d−h) pictures of the prepared VO(OH)2/rGO composite. The composite is constituted of 2D rGO nanosheets and VO(OH)2 nanoflakes, in which the nanoflakes are supported on rGO. To be specific, in the absence of GO, VO2+ species condense with a settled orientation to synthesize VO(OH)2 nanorods (Figure S1). However, in the presence of GO, the morphology of VO(OH)2/rGO (sheetlike structure) is dramatically different from that of VO(OH)2. In Figure 2a, the VO(OH)2/rGO nanosheets are randomly dispersed and closely connected with each other. Furthermore, VO(OH)2/rGO gives a paperlike feature, suggesting a flexible character. It can be observed from Figure 2b,c that, for a sheetlike hybrid composite, rGO nanosheets play the role of substrate, which is decorated with flaky VO(OH)2 structures. VO(OH)2 nanoflakes are densely and uniformly anchored on rGO nanosheets to get an almost\ncompletely coated monolayer, where there is strong interaction with each component, according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis discussed below. Also, the architecture in which rGO nanosheets are densely covered by VO(OH)2 nanoflakes effectively prevents restacking of rGO nanosheets caused by π-stacking interactions.42 A VO(OH)2 hybrid has irregular intermixed flakes with a few hundred square nanometers, and they are intimately stacked together compared with pure VO(OH)2. The above argument is strongly supported by TEM observations (Figure 2d−h). It is visible in Figure 2d that VO(OH)2 nanoflakes are wrapped up and down by rGO nanosheets. In the magnified TEM images (Figure 2e−g), it clearly seen that VO(OH)2 nanoflakes are densely and uniformly anchored on rGO to exhibit a sandwichlike composite. Furthermore, from the TEM images (Figure 2e−g), the interior structure of VO(OH)2/rGO is considerably loose because the contrast grade is either overt or covert.26 Deep insight shows that the composite exhibits hierarchical nanoporous structures, which are expected to lead to the quick and easy infiltration of electrolyte ions into the whole electrode materials.43 Figure 2h shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of VO(OH)2/rGO from the red squares in Figure 2g, in which the connected structures between VO(OH)2 and 2D rGO are apparently detected. As covered by rGO, the fingerprint between the neighboring planes of VO(OH)2 is not very clear or is occasionally observed. As inserted in Figure 2h, the lattice fringe of VO(OH)2 with 0.20 nm is detected, which corresponds to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak of VO(OH)2 at around 2θ = 45° (Figure S2). A selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 2h) confirms that VO(OH)2/rGO has a typical polycrystalline structure and the degree of crystallinity is relatively high. The diffraction rings with lattice fringes with spaces of 0.36, 0.25, 0.20, 0.18, and 0.15 nm correspond to the XRD peaks of VO(OH)2 (Figure S2) at around 2θ = 24°, 36°, 45°, 50°, and 62°, respectively. Hence, the SAED pattern convincingly proves the existence of VO(OH)2. Therefore, the perfect structural integrity of the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite constructed from 2D rGO nanosheets and VO(OH)2 nanoflakes is fabricated. This unique architecture suggests that the VO(OH)2/rGO composite is a rather not oversimplified physical admixture, but there are indeed chemical bonds between VO(OH)2 and rGO. For a change of the morphology from VO(OH)2 nanorods to nanoflakes, rGO nanosheets provide anchor points for the growth of not only VO(OH)2 but also the structure-directing agents.\n27 In general, the structure where VO(OH)2 nanoflakes tightly anchor on rGO nanosheets not only enhances the electrical conductivity but also improves structural stability, which is beneficial to the electrochemical cycling stability. Moreover, VO(OH)2 nanoflakes overlapped with each other closely interconnect with rGO nanosheets, which assists in bridging the distance of the electrons and ions, simultaneously improving their electrochemical performance. Figure S3 shows the XRD pattern of GO and graphite, which supports the successful synthesis of GO. There is a strong characteristic peak at 10.66° for GO, indicating that graphite sheets (d002 = 0.355 nm) are expanded to 0.860 nm by the oxygen functional groups introduced via the improved Hummers’ method.38,39 Figure S2 gives the XRD patterns of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO. The as-prepared VO(OH)2 is very consistent with JCPDS 11-0209, demonstrating that VO(OH)2 is successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2936\nmethod. For VO(OH)2/rGO, most of the peaks are attributed to VO(OH)2, except for a few impure peaks indexed to V 5+ (V2O5), which are due to the oxidation of GO. On the one hand, V4+ is partially oxidized to V5+; on the other hand, GO is reduced to rGO. The characteristic reflection of GO in VO(OH)2/rGO disappears, but an indistinct broad peak at around 22° appears, which is ascribed to the (002) plane of exfoliated rGO. In addition, the peak of rGO is weak and broad and overlapped by the strong peak of VO(OH)2. It can be speculated that only a few rGO nanosheets respond to the XRD signal because the surface of rGO is almost covered with VO(OH)2, which can effectively avoid restacking of the rGO nanosheets.44 Figures S4 and S5 respectively show energydispersive spectrometry (EDS) and elemental mapping images of VO(OH)2/rGO, revealing the coexistence of carbon, oxygen, and vanadium elements. The omnipresent distribution suggests that VO(OH)2 is intimately combined with rGO to form 3D networks (Figure 2). To further prove the uniform distribution of VO(OH)2 on the rGO surface, Raman mapping was carried out (Figure S6). Figure S6a shows the optical image of VO(OH)2/rGO, and Figure S6b displays the corresponding Raman mapping of the VO(OH)2/rGO signal at 516 cm−1. As can be seen from the randomly selected areas (10 × 10 μm2), the signal of VO(OH)2/rGO almost responds in the whole area, although the intensity is different. The silent area of VO(OH)2/rGO is due to the unevenness of the surface caused by the concave shape during pressing.45 Hence, the Raman mapping of VO(OH)2/rGO proves that the rGO sheets are covered uniformly by the VO(OH)2 nanoflakes. Figure S7 shows the TEM image of VO(OH)2/rGO and the corresponding elemental mapping images. Elemental mappings of VO(OH)2/rGO confirm the simultaneous existence of carbon (red), vanadium (yellow and green), and oxygen (blue), indicating the uniform distribution of VO(OH)2. Figure S8 shows the full XPS spectra [C 1s in VO(OH)2 was used as the charge reference], revealing the elements in the corresponding samples: VO(OH)2 (vanadium and oxygen),\nGO (carbon and oxygen), and VO(OH)2/rGO (vanadium, oxygen, and carbon). Figure 3a represents the binding energy for the V 2p peaks in VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO. The energy bands at 516.3 eV (V 2p3/2) and 523.8 eV (V 2p1/2) suggest that vanadium is VIV in VO(OH)2.\n30 For VO(OH)2/ rGO, the V 2p3/2 binding energy, which can be treated as two peaks, is contributed to VIV (516.5 eV) and VV (517.5 eV).46 Although V4+ is partially converted to V5+ because of the oxidation of GO, the relatively small peak area of V5+ declares that the major vanadium is V4+, indicating that most of the vanadium-based material is still VO(OH)2 in the composite. This result supports that GO is reduced to rGO by a small amount of V4+. The C 1s peaks of VO(OH)2/rGO and GO are shown in Figure 3b. They can both be split into three peaks at 284.4, 285.9, and 288.5 eV in the composite (at 284.8, 286.9, and 288.6 eV in GO), which correspond to C−C/CC, C− O, and CO, respectively. For GO, the carbon bond with the strongest relative intensity is C−O, suggesting that graphite is successfully oxidized in the oxidation reaction. However, in VO(OH)2/rGO, the peak of CC/C−C exhibits complete dominance, while the intensities of C−O and CO become enormously weakened. All of these changes suggest that, with removal of the oxygen functional groups, the sp2 carbon network effectively gets restored and GO is greatly reduced to rGO. Figure 3c shows the O 1s spectra of GO and VO(OH)2/ rGO. The binding energy can be fitted to two peaks, 532.3 and 533.1 eV, which correspond to O−C and OC of the residual oxygen groups. For the VO(OH)2/rGO sample, except for the two similar peaks of O−C (531.2 eV) and OC (532.0 eV), the binding energy arising at 530.1 eV is indexed to V−O. It is worth noting that the binding energy of V4+ in VO(OH)2/rGO slightly shifts to a higher value compared with that of VO(OH), whereas the binding energies of the carbon bonds and oxygen functional groups of VO(OH)2/rGO shift to lower values. These results indicate that a certain intercalation exists between the VO(OH)2 nanoflakes and rGO nanosheets, driven by a probable electron transfer from VO(OH)2 to\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2937\nrGO, which is considerable evidence that VO(OH)2 effectively combines with rGO through chemical interactions.47,48 Commonly, the inner electrons and nucleus can produce strong Coulomb interactions in the atom, and a shielding effect is applied by the outer electrons. Therefore, the binding energy (Eb) is calculated as follows:\nE V Vb c n= +\nwhere Vc means the Coulomb force and Vn represents the repulsive force. According to the equation, with a decrease of the outer electron concentration of VO(OH)2, the corresponding shielding effect will decrease and the binding energy of the inner electrons will increase because of a penetration effect, then causing the V 2p peaks of VO(OH)2 to shift in a higherenergy direction. In the meantime, the shielding effect is enhanced when the density of the outer electrons is increased, resulting in the corresponding O 1s and C 1s peaks in rGO shifting in a lower-energy direction. According to the above results, VO(OH)2/rGO has an intimate interface and an electron interaction through the V−O−C bonds. Moreover, this intimate interaction of electrons is conducive to the improvement of the conductivity of VO(OH)2/rGO, thereby enhancing the electrochemical properties. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO, VO(OH)2, and VO(OH)2/rGO are shown in Figure 3e. In GO, there is a broad peak at 3400 cm−1, which is contributed to O−H of carboxylic acid. Also, the other peaks at 1720, 1208, 1050, 851, and 586 cm−1 are ascribed to CO and C−O in phenolic acid, C−O in alkoxy, C−H and OCO in carboxylic acid, respectively, suggesting that there are abundant oxygen groups on GO.49 In VO(OH)2, the wavenumbers at 3563 and 3268 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of V−OH and hydrogen-bonded OH groups, and the strong peak at 969 cm−1 is related to the VO2+ stretching vibration. The wavenumbers at 866 and 799 cm−1 are indexed to the inplane V−OH deformations. Also, the wavenumbers at 623, 542, and 446 cm−1 are assigned to the torsional modes of the OH groups.50 Most of the peaks in VO(OH)2/rGO are well consistent with pure VO(OH)2, except for the three new peaks\nat 3430, 1124, and 1050 cm−1. The peak present at around 3430 cm−1 is related to the O−H bond of rGO. The wavenumber at 1124 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of C−O, which shifts to a lower wavenumber compared with that of GO. The reason for the blue shift is that the oxygen group coordinates to metal ions, which proves that rGO interconnects with VO(OH)2.\n51 Also, the weak peak appearing at 1040 cm−1 is ascribed to V5+O. The existence of V5+ is inconsistent with the results of XRD and XPS. Raman spectra are employed for investigating the structures of GO, VO(OH)2, and VO(OH)2/rGO. Raman signals from 0 to 1100 cm−1 of VO(OH)2/rGO (Figure 3f) are attributed to the various bending and stretching modes of VO(OH)2. As for GO and VO(OH)2/rGO, two peaks are the characteristic peaks of the D (1351 cm−1) and G (1599 cm−1) bands, respectively. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is frequently used for the defects and disorder assessment. The ID/IG ratios are 1.0 and 1.24 for GO and VO(OH)2/rGO, respectively. Corresponding to the analysis of XPS, VO(OH)2 interacts with rGO via V−O−C bonds, which usually causes defects such as bonding disorders and vacancies in the graphene lattice, and thus these defects increase the intensity ratio of ID/IG. Moreover, the relatively high ID/IG value of VO(OH)2/rGO also is a result of the growth direction of rGO for VO(OH)2 in the synthesis process, which leads to a high density of open and disordered edges or grain boundaries on the top scattering more the Raman signal.52,53 Therefore, higher values of VO(OH)2/rGO prove that VO(OH)2effectively interacts with rGO materials. In addition, the location of the G band is also vital proof for the structural change of the carbon materials, which can further support the above findings. Compared with GO, the G band of VO(OH)2/rGO is shifted to lower frequency, demonstrating that there are more vacancies in the graphene lattice and a compressive strain effect from the surface physiochemical interaction between VO(OH)2 and rGO. 54\nThe porous properties of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements, as depicted in Figure 3d. The Brunauer−Emmett−Teller\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2938\n(BET) specific areas of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO are 14.3 and 34.4 m2·g−1, respectively. The corresponding Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BJH) pore volumes respectively reach 0.049 and 0.115 cm3·g−1. The values of both the BET specific area and BJH pore volume of VO(OH)2/rGO are higher than that of VO(OH)2, illustrating that the incorporation of rGO increases the surface area and enhances the porosity. Obviously, both of the samples display a type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores.55 The pore-size distributions of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO calculated from the adsorption part of the nitrogen isotherm are given in Figure 3d. Compared with VO(OH)2, VO(OH)2/rGO shows more apparent meso- and macroporous structures. The pore-size distribution of VO(OH)2/rGO is mainly centered at two regions, 2−3.5 and 10− 75 nm, whereas VO(OH)2 only exhibits a large region. Furthermore, the number of pores of VO(OH)2/rGO is much higher than that of VO(OH)2. The various porous structures can cooperate well with each other. On the one hand, the macropores act as reservoirs to lead electrolytes to quickly insinuate into the electrodes. On the other hand, the mesopores can offer lots of active sites for the faradaic process. The coexistence of various porous structures shortens the electron-transport path and accelerates the insertion/desertion of ions, which is expected to improve the electrochemical properties of 3D VO(OH)2/rGO. 1\n2.2. Electrochemical Properties of 3D VO(OH)2/rGO. To investigate the electrical properties of 3D VO(OH)2/rGO, the electrodes were sufficiently tested by using a threeelectrode system in 1 mol·L−1 LiClO4/polycarbonate. Figure S9 shows the representative CV curves of VO(OH)2/rGO (20%) within various potential windows, which reveals that the\nhighest specific capacity is achieved in the relatively large potential window of −1.2 to +0.8 V. Thus, the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed within this potential range. Parts a−d of Figure 4 show the GCD curves of VO(OH)2 and 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composites with various rGO contents (10%, 20%, and 40%) at different current densities from 0.5 to 10 A·g−1. The shapes of these GCD curves are nonlinear, which is different from the typical EDLC electrode materials whose GCD curves are triangular. There are two platform parts in VO(OH)2/rGO composites, which well corresponds to the positions of the redox peaks in the CV curves (Figure 5). The reason for the appearance of plateaus is the charge-storage mechanism of vanadium oxides due to the intercalation/ extraction of lithium ions, which causes reversible redox reactions.56 Figure 4e summarizes the GCD curves at 1 A·g−1, which clearly shows that VO(OH)2/rGO (20%) exhibits the best electrochemical performance. The specific capacitances were measured as 62 F·g−1 (0%), 294 F·g−1 (10%), 403 F·g−1 (20%), and 257 F·g−1 (40%), correspondingly, and the specific capacities reach 124 C·g−1 (0%), 588 C·g−1 (10%), 806 C·g−1 (20%), and 514 C·g−1 (40%). Furthermore, Figure 4f describes the relationship between the specific capacities and current densities of these four samples at different current densities from 0.5 to 10 A·g−1. First, the values of the capacities decline with increasing current densities. The reasons for the attenuation are due to not only the incremental voltage drop26 but also inadequate utilization of the active material. Second, the capacities of the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composites are considerably improved compared with that of VO(OH)2, which evidences the perfect cooperation of the carbonaceous material and VO(OH)2 in agreement with other compo-\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2939\nsites.57−59 Among VO(OH)2/rGO composites, there is too little content of rGO in VO(OH)2/rGO (10%), which can realize the effect of rGO. On the contrary, an overdose of rGO in VO(OH)2/rGO (40%) limits the electrochemical performance because of the poor electrochemical performance of GO (Figure S10) or caused by agglomeration and then destruction of the structural stability.60 Last, VO(OH)2/rGO (20%) exhibits the highest capacity within the whole current density ranges. The specific capacities reach 512, 403, 353, 276, and 237 F·g−1 (1024, 806, 706, 552, and 474 C·g−1) at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 A·g−1, respectively. The achieved values are even higher than those of other vanadium materials such as SC electrodes, as concluded in Table S1. To further assess the electrochemical performances of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO, their CV profiles were carried out at different scan rates from 5 to 100 mV·s−1, as shown in parts a and b of Figure 5a, respectively. The CV curves at various scan rates still maintain similar shapes, suggesting that VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO possess excellent faradaic response as electrode materials. With increasing scan rates, the response currents also increase, illustrating rapid ionic and electronic transport.61 Furthermore, the currents of the anodic and cathodic peaks are almost consistent, which is evidence of outstanding electrochemical reversibility. Besides, because of the effect of polarization, redox peaks slightly shift at different scan rates, but they are still observed even at 100 mV·s−1, which implies good ionic and electronic conduction and superior rate capability. Intuitively, Figure S11 compares the CV curves of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO at 10 mV·s\n−1, which show redox peaks due to VO(OH)2 surrounded by EDLCs.19 Wang et al.12 mentioned that the relationship between the voltammetry and various sweep rates is represented as follows:\ni avb= When b = 0.5, the material shows battery behavior, which is controlled by diffusion, whereas when b is equal or close to 1, the electrode active material is intercalation pseudocapaci-\ntive.12,62 Figure S12 shows the CV curves from 0.1 to 5 mV·s−1 and plots of log i versus log v of VO(OH)2/rGO, in which the b value is approximately 1, suggesting a surface-controlled capacitor behavior via a fast Li+ intercalation process. A similar phenomenon is reported in newly published literature.15,18,48,63\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that the mass loading of active materials decides the true performance, which was reported by Gogotsi and Simon.64 In this work, the mass loading is about 3.5 mg·cm−2 and VO(OH)2/rGO still retains a high capacitance, indicating that it exhibits superior intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior. Therefore, the capacitance of VO(OH)2/rGO originated from the IPC\n20 and the EDLC is associated with rGO. The electrochemical redox reactions of VO(OH)2 may be represented by the following equation: VO(OH)2 + xLi\n+ + xe− ↔ LixVO(OH)2 (x shows the mole fraction of the intercalated lithium ions). Besides, as for the VO(OH)2/rGO composite, another pair of redox peaks exists. The reason is that V4+ is oxidized to V5+ because of the oxidation of GO, which is proven in the above discussion of the composition. It is well-known that vanadium oxides consisting of V5+ are typical battery-type electrode materials that show characteristic redox peaks caused by reversible faradaic redox reactions.65,66 Hence, the storage energy of VO(OH)2/rGO is a combination of the intercalation pseudocapacitive and double-layer-capacitive processes. The cycling stability is an important parameter for highperformance SCs. Figure 5c shows the cycling performance of VO(OH)2 and 3D VO(OH)2/rGO. The cycling performance of VO(OH)2/rGO (95% after 5000 cycles) is very remarkable compared with VO(OH)2 (7% after 2000 cycles). The poor cycling performance of VO(OH)2 is caused by its unstable structures during repeated charge/discharge processes.29 For the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite, the capacitance exhibits a slight decline in the first 100 cycles because of the typical problem of vanadium-based materials in that it is hard to avoid dissolution in active materials during constant circulation.67 Nevertheless, after 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention reaches 95% because of interacted 3D networks of VO(OH)2/\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2940\nrGO. Namely, rGO nanosheets provide many active sites for a combination with VO(OH)2; thus, VO(OH)2 nanoflakes tightly anchor to rGO. As is well-known, rGO possesses an excellent stable structure and conduction. Therefore, the cycling stability of VO(OH)2/rGO is greatly improved and is superior to those of other vanadium-based materials (Table S1). In addition, the Coulomb efficiency of VO(OH)2/rGO remains almost 100%, suggesting good reversibility of the electrode. However, for VO(OH)2, it declines after many cycles, corresponding to the poor cycling stability (Figure S13). Figure 5d depicts the Nyquist plots of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO, which contains two parts, the higherfrequency region (the arched part) and the lower-frequency region (the straight-line part), which can be fitted by the equivalent circuit. Rs represents bulk resistance from the electrolyte, electrode materials, and interface between the active material and nickel foam, which can be represented by the intercept of the X axis. Cdl is related to the constant phaseangle element of the double-layer capacitance. Rct is the charge-transfer resistance, which is represented by the diameter of the semicircle. Zw stands for the Warburg resistance related to the inclined line in the lower-frequency region, which means solid-state diffusion of the lithium ions. In Figure 5d, VO(OH)2/rGO shows a more depressed semicircle than VO(OH)2, which is difficult to observe. Rs (axis intercepts) of VO(OH)2 and VO(OH)2/rGO are about 0.5 and 1.5 Ω, respectively. Rs and Rct of VO(OH)2/rGO are considerably reduced compared with VO(OH)2 because of the larger specific area and abundant porous structure of VO(OH)2/ rGO. On the one hand, the pores are like reservoirs for electrolytes to intimately and rapidly infiltrate to the interior of the active material. On the other hand, the larger specific area provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions. Thus, electrons and Li+ ions transfer more quickly to promote redox\nreaction kinetics.60 The line in the low-frequency region of VO(OH)2/rGO is more vertical than VO(OH)2, which demonstrates excellent conduction and a shorter Li+/electronic transmission path. With coassociation of rGO, the conductivity of VO(OH)2/rGO has been greatly improved, which supports that rGO effectively facilitates electron transfer, as described in Figure 1b.\n2.3. Electrochemical Performance of VO(OH)2/rGO. To explore the practical application of the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite, the flexible SSC was assembled using this unique composite, denoted as the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device, as schematically shown in Figure S14. From CV curves of the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device (Figure 6a), it is observed that the voltage window can be extended to 2.6 V. For feasibility and optimum content, the voltage range is 0−2.4 V, which is larger than many devices in the references (generally less than 2 V; Table S2). As shown in Figure 6b, the shape of the CV curves is quasi-rectangular and is well-maintained even at 100 mV·s−1. This demonstrates that the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device possesses outstanding capacitive behavior and good rate properties. Figure 6c shows GCD files within the voltage of 0−2.4 V at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mA·cm−2, and the specific capacitances (Figure 6d) reach 70.3, 68.1, 47.9, 30.5, and 20.2 F·g−1 (405, 392, 276, 176, and 116 mF·cm−2), respectively. Notably, the GCD curves are symmetric and quasi-linear, which reveals that the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device has remarkable reversibility. To explore the cycling stability of the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device in real applications, a 2000- cycle cycling stability test was carried out at 50 mV·s−1 (Figure 6e). During the first 300 cycles, retention of the VO(OH)2/ rGO SSC device gradually increases and reaches up to 125% of its initial value. This phenomenon is the activation process of the electrode, which is attributed to the electrolyte gradually infiltrating the active materials with repeated charge/discharge\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl. Nano Mater. 2019, 2, 2934−2945\n2941\nprocesses.68 After 2000 cycles, the Coulomb efficiency is almost 100%, whereas the capacitance retention is about 96% with little decline. The reason is that the voltage window of 2.2 V is really wide; thus, the strong stress introduced by structure expansion during Li+ insertion into VO(OH)2/rGO easily causes its structure to collapse, which promotes the dissolution of VO(OH)2/rGO. Moreover, limited to the conditions of device manufacturing, during the many charge/discharge processes, the ion mobility and kinetics in the device are slower than those in the case of a three-electrode system. The above reasons lead to a decrease of the capacitance retention. To study the flexibility and mechanical stability of the\nVO(OH)2/rGO SSC device, CV tests were carried out at various bending angles at 50 mV·s−1. Under bending angles from 0° to 150° (Figure 6f), the CV curves remain nearly similar in shape, which evidences the excellent flexibility and mechanical stability of the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device. Figure S15 displays the CV curves of nickel foam bending to 90° after the 1st, 30th, 50th, and 100th cycles. They are gradually deformed from the 1st to 100th bending. Figure 7d describes the Ragone plots of the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device compared with previous reports. The maximum energy density measures 56.26 Wh·kg−1 (3.24 Wh·m−2) at 104.16 W·kg−1 (6 W·m−2), which is comparable or even higher than previous reports (Table S2), such as the V2O5 SSC (43 Wh·kg−1 at 900 W·kg−1),56 V2O5/polyindole SSC (38.7 Wh· kg−1 at 900 W·kg−1),69 rGO/V2O5 ASS (75.9 Wh·kg\n−1 at 900 W·kg−1),39 RG/VO2//RG ASC (22.8 Wh·kg\n−1 at 425 W· kg−1),70 graphene/VO2 SSC (21.3 Wh·kg\n−1),71 Ni0.85Se@ MoSe2//GNS (25.5 Wh·kg\n−1 at 420 W·kg−1),72 NiCo2O4− MnO2/GF//CNT/GF (55.1 Wh·kg −1 at 187.5 W·kg−1),73 V2O5//V2O5 (1.18 W·h·m −2 at 4 W·m−2), V2O5//C (1.22 W· h·m−2 at 4 W·m−2),74 and PANI/SWCNTs//PANI/SWCNTs (19.45 Wh·kg−1 at 320.5 W·kg−1).75 According to the above results, the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a large voltage window of up to 2.4 V, a specific capacitance as high as 70.3 F·g−1 (405 mF· cm−2) at 0.5 mA·cm−2, and an energy density of 56.26 Wh· kg−1 (3.24 Wh·m−2) at 104.16 W·kg−1 (6 W·m−2). The cycling stability is about 96% after 2000 cycles, and the Coulomb efficiency is almost 100%. These features are even higher than or comparable to some related devices, as shown in Table S2. Because a single device limits the working potential window,\nusing serial assemblies is a simple and viable way to control the operating voltage. The GCD curves for an individual device and two devices connected in series are tested, as shown in Figure 7a. The charge/discharge voltage of two devices connected in series reaches up to 4.8 V with almost the same discharge time compared with that of a single device, which approaches a theoretical factor of 2, confirming the theorem of a series of capacitor connections. To further assess the practicability of the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device, it was used to power the LED lights. After two VO(OH)2/rGO SSC devices were charged at 4.8 V, they can light red and blue LEDs with working voltages from 1.8 to 2.0 V and from 2.2 to 2.4 V, respectively. After charging for 100 s, the red light can work for about 12 min (Figure 7b,c) and the blue light for about 5 min (Figure 7e,f). The red LED is lighter and works longer than the blue one, which is because of the higher working voltage of the blue LED. Thus, the assembled VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance."

      "text" : "In summary, 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composites with unique architectures were successfully synthesized through a facile low-temperature one-step hydrothermal method. VO(OH)2 nanoflakes wrapped with rGO nanosheets were yielded and stacked together to form a 3D interlaced network. Because of their unique 3D networks, low resistance, and synergistic action of the double-layer-capacitive and intercalation pseudocapacitive features, VO(OH)2/rGO composites exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with specific capacitances as high as 512 F·g−1 (1024 C·g−1) at 0.5A·g−1 and prominent cycling stabilities with 95% of the vital value after 5000 cycles. As for the symmetric device, the VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device not only delivers a high energy density of 56.26 Wh·kg−1 at 104.16 W·kg−1 but also exhibits outstanding flexibility and a wide potential window of 2.4 V. Notably, two connected devices in series can successfully power the commercial red and blue LEDs with 12 and 5 min, respectively, supporting considerable practical applications. Because of the competitive effect of the electrical conductivity of rGO and intercalation pseudocapacitors VO(OH)2 on the electrochemical performance of hybrid composites, the optimum content of rGO in a hybrid composite for the high-performance SC is 20%. It is believed that VO(OH)2/ rGO can be used in broader applications, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and flexible chemical sensors. This work not only enriches the research of VO(OH)2 and demonstrates their great potential for energy storage but also breaks new ground of VO(OH)2, which provides new insight into the fabrication of electrode materials for the nextgeneration SCs.\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT *S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364.\nExperimental section, SEM and TEM images of VO(OH)2 (Figure S1), XRD patterns of graphite, GO, VO(OH)2, and VO(OH)2/rGO composite (Figures S2 and S3), EDS and elemental mapping images (Figures S4 and S5), Raman mapping spectrum of VO(OH)2/ rGO composite (Figure S6), TEM and elemental mapping images of VO(OH)2/rGO composite (Figure S7), full XPS spectra (Figure S8), CV curves of VO(OH)2/rGO (Figure S9), electrochemical properties of GO and plots of log i versus log v (Figure S10), CV curves of VO(OH)2 and 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite (Figure S11), CV curves and plots of log i versus log v of VO(OH)2/rGO (Figure S12), Coulomb efficiency of VO(OH)2/rGO and VO(OH)2 (Figure S13), schematic diagram illustrating the 3D VO(OH)2/rGO SSC device configuration (Figure S14), stability of nickel foam with bending 100 times (Figure S15), and a comparison of the electrochemical properties of 3D VO(OH)2/rGO composite applied to a single-electrode system (Table S1) and a SSC device (Table S2) with previous literature (PDF)\n■ AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author *E-mail: yfzhang@dlut.edu.cn.\nDOI: 10.1021/acsanm.9b00364 ACS Appl.

    "abstractText" : "The evolution of newfangled electrode materials with excellent properties has gained tremendous attention in order to meet the requirements applied to flexible energy devices. Vanadium oxides have attracted attention in the field of energy storage, and exploration for novel vanadium-based materials applied to energy storage has received much focus recently. Vanadium oxyhydroxide [VO(OH)2], which has rarely been given much attention, may deserve wider attention because of its great potential for energy storage. To play to their full strengths, it is an excellent way to hybridize with carbon materials such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which has superior conductivity and structural stability. Herein, we develop a novel 3D composite constructed from VO(OH)2 nanoflakes wrapped with rGO nanosheets [denoted as 3D VO(OH)2/rGO] as enhanced-performance electrodes for symmetric energy storage devices. 3D VO(OH)2/rGO is synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal route, and this novel composite possesses a unique architecture and intimate interaction, which endows VO(OH)2/rGO with a remarkable electrochemical performance. A VO(OH)2/rGO electrode yields a high specific capacitance of 512 F·g−1 (1024 C·g−1) at 0.5 A·g−1 within −1.2 to +0.8 V. Impressively and unexpectedly, the assembled VO(OH)2/rGO symmetric supercapacitor exhibits the integration of desirable flexibility, 2.4 V high voltage, and high energy density, which reaches 56.26 Wh·kg−1 at 104.16 W·kg−1. After charging for 100 s, two devices in series can light red and blue light-emitting diodes for 12 and 5 min, respectively. This work not only enriches the research of VO(OH)2 but also offers new opportunities for assembling high-performance energy storage devices.",
