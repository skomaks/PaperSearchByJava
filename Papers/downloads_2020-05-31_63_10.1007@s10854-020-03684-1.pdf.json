      "text" : "Nowadays, the occurrence of toxic organic pollutants due to the development of industries has great effects on the clean environment such as the growth of plants, sea-animals, the fertility of the soil, and human health, therefore it is a serious global issue [1]. Over the past decade, young researchers focused on to synthesis of low-dimensional nanomaterials and widely used them in photocatalytic degradation of highly toxic organic pollutants [2]. Many researchers already concluded that low-dimensional materials have large surface area, active adsorptions sites, and electron–hole recombination rate under UV and visible light sources [3]. Rhodamine B is a chemical dye having structure as depicted in Scheme 1. It is generally used in industrials purposes like textiles, paints, paper, biotechnology applications such\nas fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, etc. [4]. The organic dyes may cause serious environmental problems related to eye, skin, and lung tract irritation [5]. So, eliminating dye from water is the most important and demanding task.\nFor the wastewater treatment, advanced oxidation process (AOPs) is the best alternative technique in comparison to adsorption, precipitation, and filtration for the degradation of organic pollutants [6]. The AOPs are very simple to operate eco-friendly with high efficiency and nonselective process. Generally, the Photocatalytic process is one of the types of AOPs procedure that is widely used for wastewater treatment. AOPs mainly includes the production of nonselective as well as enormously reactive hydroxyl radical (.OH). Hydroxyl radical can be formed by the interaction of Fe3+/ Fe2+ ions with H2O2, where H2O2 works as an oxidizing agent and Fe3+/Fe2+ as catalyst [7–9].\nSpinel ferrite nanomaterials offer photocatalytic properties, which are useful in various degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater [10]. The general formula of spinel ferrite nanoparticles is AFe2O4 (A can be Mn, Mg, Ni, Zn, etc.) [11–13] where A and Fe are metal cations which occupy tetrahedral and the octahedral sites, respectively * K. M. Jadhav drjadhavkm@gmail.com 1 Department of Physics, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, Maharashtra 431004, India\n1 3\n[14–16]. Spinel ferrite nanoparticles are very useful in various bio-applications and electronic industries [17–19]. The nanostructured spinel ferrite samples can be prepared by diverse wet chemical routes viz. coprecipitation [20, 21], sol–gel auto-combustion [22–24], hydrothermal [25], solvothermal [26], sonochemical [27], etc. In the wet chemical method, the sol–gel auto-combustion method is more appropriate for the preparation of spinel ferrite nanoparticles, because of its simplicity, chemical homogeneity, low synthesis temperature, and environmentally approachable [28, 29]. Sivakumar et al. [30] prepared NiFe2O4 nanoparticles by sol–gel auto-combustion method using citric acid and obtained average particle size 8 nm with saturation magnetization of 50.4 emu/g. Lynda et al. [31] reported preparation of Mg1−yNiyFe2O4 nanoparticles by sol–gel auto-combustion method using urea as reducing agent. P. P. Hankare et al. [32] successfully prepared Co1−xNixFe2O4 nanoparticles by sol–gel auto-combustion method. In the present work, structural, morphological, magnetic, and photocatalytic activity was improved with doping of Ni2+ into ZnFe2O4. The series of mixed spinel ferrite nanoparticles with chemical formula as NixZn1−xFe2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) is reported with photocatalytic activity against Rhodamine B dye degradation under sunlight."

The lattice constant was increased with increasing Ni content in ZnFe2O4, due to the difference in ionic radius of Ni2+ (0.69 Å) and Zn2+ (0.72 Å) as shown in Fig. 2b.

It is also noted that HDD sizes decreased with the increase in nickel substitution in zinc ferrite. This decrease in HDD size can be correlated with the decrement in crystallite size values. The highest size of HDD was found for the pristine zinc ferrite due to the inferior insoluble nature and agglomeration of particles in colloidal suspension. In\n1 3\naddition to DLS, the Zeta potential was also measured for all the samples to know the charge on the surface and stability of the nanoparticles. Figure 7b displays the Zeta potential of nickel-substituted zinc–ferrite nanoparticles. The zeta potential values for all the samples are found in the range of ± 37 mV and ± 43 mV.

The resistivity of spinel ferrite nanoparticles can be influenced by sintering temperature, density, and the grain size. The resistivity of the spinel ferrites can be enhanced by substituting with proper trivalent or divalent ion to make them appropriate for desired applications. DC resistivity plots were drawn as log ρ versus 1000/T for NixZn1−xFe2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) samples and are shown in Fig. 8a.\nIt is observed from Fig. 8a that DC resistivity decreases with increase in temperature obeying Arrhenius relation\nwhich shows semiconducting behavior of all the samples. The decrease in DC resistivity with temperature can be attributed to the enhanced drift mobility. The charge carriers are required for the hopping of electron between adjacent ions at octahedral sites which enhances the mobility of charge carries resulting in decrease in the resistivity and increase in the conductivity. The DC resistivity of the prepared samples increases with increasing Ni content. The activation energy for the prepared samples was calculated from the linear plot between log ρ and 1000/T using Arrhenius relation [46],\nwhere ρo represents room-temperature resistivity, kB represents Boltzmann constant, and ΔE represents activation energy. The range of the activation energy for prepared samples increases with the increasing Ni concentration as shown in Fig. 8b [47].\nThe increase in activation energy shows that more energy is needed for electrons hopping due to Ni doping. The activation energy of prepared samples is shown in Table 4. The drift mobility of the prepared samples was calculated using the below relation [48] and is shown in Fig. 8c.\n= 0e ΔE∕KBT ,\n1 3\nwhere µd is the drift mobility, e is the charge on electron, and ρ is the resistivity. Also, the values of the charge carrier’s concentrations of prepared samples were calculated using the below relation [49]\nwhere NA represents Avogadro’s number, DB represents bulk density, PFe represents the number of Fe atoms, and M represents molecules mass of the corresponding chemical formula\nn = NADBPFe\nM ,\n[50]. The calculated value of charge carrier concentrations is shown in Table 4.\nIt is observed by Hemeda et al. [51] that the diffusion of O2− ions occurs by the defects in structural vacancies. For each structure, the diffusion coefficient of oxygen vacancies was determined using the resistivity data and the given equation [52],\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient, σ is the reciprocal of resistivity, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, N is the number of atoms/cm3, and e is the charge on the electron. Table 4 shows the variance of the diffusion coefficient at 473 K for all the prepared samples and it indicates that the diffusion decreases with an increase in\nD = kBT\nNe2 ,\n1 3\ntemperature. It is clear from Table 4 that as a result of nickel doping, the diffusion coefficient decreases. It can be verified by the growth of nickel ions, resulting in the formation of cation vacancy and the decrease of oxygen vacancies in the sub-lattice."

The holes do not add to the degradation process and\n1 3\ndoes not impact dye degradation reaction time. The trapping experiment was well coordinated with the overreaction mechanism.\nThe photocatalytic degradation mechanism for the degradation of RhB under the sunlight was carried out in the following equation [65–70],\nWhen photocatalytic Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 nanoparticles absorb sunlight radiation, it will produce a pair of electron and hole (h+/e−). The electron of the valence band becomes excited by undergoing the sunlight irradiation. The additional energy of the excited electron promotes the electron to the conduction band of the Ni–Zn ferrite by creating h+/e− pair. The positive hole of Ni–Zn ferrite breaks apart the water molecules to form hydroxyl radicals. The e− reacts with oxygen molecules to form superoxide anion and generate H2O2. Hence, these ions simply spell the RhB dye molecules and give rise to by-product. This is known as a redox reaction.

All the samples were characterized by XRD for the recognition of phase-pure cubic spinel structure. Spectral studies that were carried out by FT-IR clearly show two absorptions band revealing the characteristics of ferrite skeleton. The morphology of the prepared nanoparticles was visualized by SEM and TEM microscopy technique. BET analysis showed the enhancement in surface parameters. Hydrodynamic diameter and dispersion studies were evaluated by DLS and Zeta potential measurements. The DC resistivity measured by two-probe technique shows the semiconductor behavior for all the samples. M–H hysteresis loop of all the samples exhibited the superparamagnetic behavior. The energy bandgap values obtained by the UV–Vis spectroscopy technique show the increasing trend from 1.82 to 2.07 eV with increase in Ni2+ content. The photocatalytic activity of Rhodamine B was evaluated under sunlight irradiation. With increasing Ni2+ concentration, the degradation efficiency increased to 98%. Further, the present nanocatalyst shows active reusability and can be easily separable due to its magnetic nature. The obtained results show the enhanced photocatalytic of the Ni–Zn nanoferrites under the visible light in contrast with the available literature reports.",
