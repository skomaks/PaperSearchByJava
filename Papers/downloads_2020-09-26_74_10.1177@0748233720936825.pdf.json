      "text" : "Metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be toxic to aquatic organisms, and the mechanism of toxicity may be related to the release of toxic metal ions, unique properties of the NPs, or a combination of effects. The dissolution of ions from metal NPs varies with the type of NP, and TiO2-NPs do not appreciably dissolve while others such as Zn-NPs, Ag-NPs, Cu-NPs, and CuO-NPs can release sufficient amounts of metal ions to cause acute toxicity in fishes (Bai and Tang, 2020; Shaw and Handy, 2011; Thit et al., 2017). Cu-NPs are used widely in industrial applications (Cioffi et al.,\n2005; Liu et al., 2004) and include various forms (e.g. Cu, CuO, and Cu2O) that impact their potential release of Cu ions upon NP contamination of surface\n1Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University, Rize, Turkey 2School of Biological and Marine Sciences, The University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, UK\nCorresponding author: Halis Boran, Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University 53100, Rize, Turkey.

Particle dissolution was minimal over 48 h as concentrations of dissolved Cu never exceeded 0.19 mg/L, representing <0.1% of the initial Cu added as particulate for Cu-NPs (Griffitt et al., 2007).\nThe acute toxicity of Cu-NPs in fishes may be attributed to the release of Cu ions, unknown nanospecific toxicity, or a combination of factors. The toxic effects of Cu2O-NPs on a zebrafish liver cell line (ZFL) and larval zebrafish were assessed by determining their 96-h LC50 values (ZFL: 110 ppm; zebrafish larvae: 242.4 ppb), which were less toxic than CuCl2 (ZFL: 23.04 ppm; zebrafish larvae: 85.73 ppb). Also, it was determined that CuCl2 and Cu2O-NPs upregulated mRNA levels for metallothionein (MT) (Chen et al., 2011). In another study, Cu(II) ions were used to evaluate the toxicity caused by dissolution of Cu-NPs. Toxicity of Cu-NPs at 0.01 and 0.05 mg/L showed no significant difference from Cu(II) at the corresponding concentrations (0.006 and 0.03 mg/L), but 0.1 mg/L Cu-NPs had a greater toxicity than 0.06 mg/L Cu(II) in zebrafish embryos (Bai et al., 2010). The acute toxicity of nano-Cu and CuONPs was reported in zebrafish, showing a decrease in gill Naþ/Kþ-ATPase activity (Boyle et al., 2020; Griffitt et al., 2007) and a depletion of total glutathione (Boyle et al., 2020). In zebrafish exposed to nano-Cu, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results revealed higher levels of changes in global gene expression compared to CuSO4exposed fish. Also, cluster analysis of these gene microarrays demonstrated that the gene expression response induced by nano-Cu was highly divergent (Griffitt et al., 2007).\nThe hardness of fresh surface water (as CaCO3) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) are known to influence the bioavailability of metals to aquatic organisms. Calcium competitively inhibits the uptake, and hence, toxicity of trace metals at the cell membrane surface (Markich and Jeffree, 1994), whereas complexation of trace metals with carbonate in the aquatic medium, reduces the concentrations of toxic metal species (Hunt, 1987; Terzi and Verep, 2012). Also, synthetic materials like EDTA are known to be effective chelating agents of metals (Ferrero, 2016; Khangarot, 1981). Research studies show that the introduction of Na-EDTA in metalpolluted water enhances the survival chances of marine organisms (Lawrence et al., 1981; Lewis et al., 1972; Licop, 1988; McDougall et al., 2019).\nAlthough several studies have found that water hardness typically reduces the toxicity of Cu to\nfreshwater biota (Liao et al., 2019; Perschbacher and Wurts, 1999; Van Genderen et al., 2007; Yim et al., 2006), insufficient or inconsistent data have precluded an algorithm being established. Furthermore, there is a paucity of information on the correlation between the introduction of chelating agents in metal-polluted water and the reduction of metal toxicity. Understanding how Cu2þ and Cu-NPs toxicity and bioavailability in fish are affected by the presence of CaCO3 and chelating agent EDTA in the water column is therefore an important aspect of risk assessment for the toxic metals. Cu-NPs are of great interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology because of their broad industrial and commercial applications. Therefore, toxicity and relationship with chelating agents of Cu-NPs needs to be thoroughly understood in terms of industrial health. The basic hypotheses tested in the present study were that Cu2þ will have a greater toxic effect than Cu-NPs and that CaCO3 and EDTA will reduce the toxicity of Cu in zebrafish.\nThe present study compared the effects of Cu-NPs and corresponding concentrations of released Cu2þ (derived from CuSO4) in experimental exposures of larval zebrafish in environmentally relevant media. The objectives of the present work were (1) to determine the acute toxicity of Cu-NPs and released Cu2þ, (2) to investigate Cu-NP toxicity in larvae to clarify whether toxic effects are attributable to the release of Cu ions, and (3) to assess the effect of the calcium hardness (as CaCO3) and chelating agent EDTA on Cu toxicity by evaluating metallothionein-2 (MT2) gene expression alteration in larval zebrafish."

      "text" : "Experimental animals and exposure solutions\nAdult zebrafish (Danio rerio, age 4–5 months) were obtained from the Zebrafish Research Facility at Plymouth University (Plymouth, UK) and reared in recirculating aquaria systems. Fish husbandry, spawning, and experimental procedures were conducted within the guidelines of animal welfare regulations directed by Plymouth University and within the United Kingdom (Henry et al., 2013). Photoperiod was 14:10 h (light:dark), and fish were fed three times daily with live brine shrimp nauplii, Artemia sp. or dry fish flake mix (equal proportions ZM Systems flake, brine shrimp, spirulina, and TetraMin® stable flake, Melle, Germany). Embryos were obtained by spawning adult fish, embryos were all of the same age (i.e. within 1 h fertilization), and hatching occurred at approximately\n72 h post fertilization (hpf). Broodstock fish were bulk spawned, and eggs were collected and reared in 50 mL Petri dishes with daily water changes. After hatching, the larvae were inspected, and any showing malformations or those of very small size were removed. Fish of age 72–168 hpf were used for all exposures. Local (Plymouth, UK) mains supply water maintained at 26 + 1 C was obtained. The water was left to stand for a minimum of 24 h and aerated to expel any chlorine. This water was used for all larval exposures. Water quality parameters were measured daily (mean + standard deviation) for pH (6.9 + 0.2), temperature (27.5 + 1 C), and dissolved oxygen (94% + 2), and nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium were measured weekly (<0.1, <20, and <0.02 mg/L, respectively).\nThe Cu-NPs used were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and had (from manufacturer’s information) an average particle size <50 nm and 99.9% purity. A fresh 50 mL stock solution of 1 mg/mL Cu-NPs was generated without solvents by dispersing the NPs in ultrapure Milli-Q (Millipore) water with sonication (bath type sonicator, 35 kHz frequency, Fisherbrand FB 11010, Germany) for 1 h. All other reagents (CuSO4, CaCO3, and EDTA) were of analytical grade and used without further purification. All laboratory polypropylene, polyethylene, and glassware were soaked in 5% HNO3 (v/v) for at least 48 h and rinsed with distilled water more than three times prior to use. Deionized (DI) water from a Millipore Milli-Q ultrapure water system was used throughout the study. Stock solutions of the chemicals were prepared in DI water, and polyethylene or polypropylene test equipment and bottles mostly used to avoid the adsorption of metals (Boyle et al., 2015).\nExperiment 1: Zebrafish acute exposure to Cu2þ\nand Cu-NPs Zebrafish were exposed to Cu2þ and Cu-NPs to establish the 96-h lethal concentration for 50% mortality (i.e. LC50), to identify sublethal concentrations for subsequent experimentation, and to evaluate MT2 expression in relation to Cu2þ and Cu-NPs concentrations. To determine LC50 values of CuSO4 and Cu-NPs, stock solutions were added to each 400 mL and 2 L exposure beakers at eight different nominal concentrations (0, 40, 80, 160, 300, 600, 1200, and 3000 mg/L) for Cu2þ and six different nominal concentrations (0, 40, 200, 500, 1000, and 3000 mg/L) for Cu-NPs, respectively, and for each experiment at least\nthree beakers were included without Cu2þ and CuNPs as an experimental control. Thirty larval zebrafish (72 hpf) were put in each beaker and tried to determine the mortality of larvae (LC50) at 96 h period of time at different concentrations (Boran and Ulutas, 2016). After determination of lethal and sublethal concentration of Cu2þ and Cu-NPs, gene expression experiments were conducted to compare Cu2þ and Cu-NPs. Independent exposures with zebrafish larvae were performed with variable concentrations of Cu2þ and Cu-NPs to determine the concentration-dependent relationship between Cu and MT2 induction (n ¼ 3 chamber per concentration). The usefulness of MT as a bioavailability indicator of metal exposure has been questioned (Mieiro et al., 2011) and its use requires validation within a test system. Previously, we have demonstrated the concentration-dependent induction of MT2 expression in zebrafish larvae exposed to sublethal concentrations of another heavy metal for 24 h from72 hpf (Henry et al., 2013). After larvae (n ¼ 30 per chamber) were gently placed into chambers, both Cu2þ and Cu-NPs were immediately dosed into beakers from separate stocks and the exposures commenced for 96 h. Fish were collected immediately after exposure (96 h) and preserved at 80 C until processing.\nExperiment 2: Bioavailability of Cu2þ and Cu-NPs associated with calcium and EDTA\nBased on the results of Experiment 1, sublethal concentrations (2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 40 mg/L) of Cu2þwere selected for further experimentation. A 200 mL volume of the Cu2þ stock was placed in a 400 mL beaker, Cu2þ stock was added to obtain the sublethal concentrations. Three beakers were used for each exposure concentration and each control, and controls included an experimental control (no added Cu2þ). To perform the sublethal experiments of Cu-NPs, an exposure chamber was designed to prevent fish from residing on the bottom of the beaker during exposure. The chamber consisted of a 95 mm long 70 mm diameter plastic pipe with one end covered with nylon mesh (mesh size 0.5 mm). Chambers were suspended vertically in 2 L glass beakers such that the top end (without mesh) of the plastic pipe was 1 cm above the surface of the water in the 2 L beaker (containing 2.0 L fish water). Exposure solutions were prepared in 2 L beakers prior to placement of the exposure chambers in the beakers as described above. After exposure solutions were prepared, exposure chambers were\nplaced in each 2 L beaker and 30 larval zebrafish were placed in the exposure chamber such that they resided on the nylon mesh (approximately 10 cm above the bottom of the beaker). After 96-h sublethal exposure of Cu-NPs (10, 20, 40, 60, 100, and 150 mg/L), fish were preserved immediately for assessment of MT2 expression. Also, MT2 gene expression experiments were performed to evaluate water hardness (as CaCO3) and EDTA effects on Cu 2þ and Cu-NPs toxicity for 96 h. To investigate water hardness and EDTA effects on Cu toxicity, 220 mg/L CaCO3 (Van Genderen et al., 2007) and 5 mg/L EDTA (Khangarot, 1981) were added into the test solutions. Thirty larvae were put into each exposure beaker and established control groups for MT2 gene expression analysis. At the end of exposure, fish were immediately removed and preserved ( 80 C) for MT2 expression analysis (Henry et al., 2013)."

RNA was eluted into 30 mL and the concentration and quality of total RNA was determined by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, Delaware, USA). All samples were diluted to 100 ng/mL total RNA, and 800 ng was used to synthesize cDNA following the manufacturer’s protocol for ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Southampton, UK), with hexanucleotide primers and deoxynucleotide mix (SigmaAldrich). cDNA was synthesized in the following conditions: annealing at 25 C, extending at 42 C, and heat-inactivating transcriptase at 70 C (GeneAmp® PCR System, 9700, Applied Biosystems, California,\nUSA). cDNA was stored at 80 C until quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) transcriptional analysis (Boran and Ulutas, 2016).\nThe lyophilized primers were reconstituted with nuclease-free water to a concentration of 100 mmol/ L. Using a cDNA sample known to contain a high level of MT2 transcript, the following analyses were performed. Also, a standard PCR was performed using cDNA at a concentration of 33.3 ng/L and primers at 1 103 mmol/L. Primers specific for zebrafish MT2 and the zebrafish housekeeping gene -actin were purchased from Eurofins UK (Wolverhampton, UK) (Table 1). In accordance with manufacturer’s protocols, the lyophilized primers were reconstituted to 100 mmol with RNase-free water and mixed with SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) to give a final reaction concentration of 375 nmol in 20 mL total volume. Standard PCR was performed using cDNA sample dilution series with MT2 primers and the product was evaluated for size and band strength and purity by gel electrophoresis using a 1% agarose gel (Boran et al., 2016). Real-time fluorescence was detected (StepOne RTPCR System, Applied Biosystems) over 40 cycles, cycling conditions of 94 C for denaturing, primerspecific annealing 55–60 C, and extension at 72 C. The melt curve was analyzed from the following conditions: 15 s at 94 C, 1 min at 60 C, and 15 s at 94 C. For analysis, the cycle threshold was set to 25,000 for all qPCR runs. A standard curve of cDNA template (pooled template from each sample within experiment) was run on each plate to allow for withinexperiment plate normalization. For gene expression analysis, the efficiency of qPCR was calculated (e ¼ 10( 1/slope) 1) based on a four- or five-point standard curve on each plate. Samples from the same experiment run over multiple plates were normalized to the plate with the efficiency closest to 1 by adjusting for slope and intercept of the standard curves. Efficiencies between 0.9 and 1.1 were accepted for\nfurther analyses, and the comparative quantification method (2 CT ) was used for calculating fold changes in the gene of interest normalized to -actin (Boran and Ulutas, 2016)."

      "text" : "No changes in behavior of zebrafish larvae were observed upon addition of Cu2þ or Cu-NPs to exposure water and there was no mortality of larvae in unexposed controls. Mortality from the 96-h lethal Cu2þ and Cu-NPs concentration-response exposure experiments demonstrates for the three repeats is shown in Figure 1. To accurately calculate the 96-h LC50 value, the data underwent log transformation and were plotted on a graph showing logistic regression. Mortality of zebrafish larvae exposed 72 hpf increased with concentrations of Cu2þ and Cu-NPs\n(logistic regression, p < 0.05), and the Cu2þ and CuNPs concentrations computed from the logistic model that resulted in 50% mortality at 96-h exposure (96-h LC50) were 226 mg/L (195–262) and 648 mg/L (575– 733), respectively. The concentrations of 2–40 mg/L Cu2þ and 10–150 mg/L Cu-NPs were selected as the sublethal concentrations for further experimentation, and the expression of MT2 was assessed in experiments with these concentrations.\n-actin gene expression in larvae was not changed by experimental exposures in Cu2þ or Cu-NPs treatment (p > 0.05). Thus, usage of -actin as a housekeeping gene was justified. The selected and analyzed gene (MT2) showed some upregulation in larvae exposed to Cu2þ or Cu-NPs. MT2 gene expression in zebrafish larvae is relative to the Cu2þ and Cu-NPs concentration after 96-h exposure (Figure 2). Regression analysis demonstrated a strong positive linear relationship between MT2 expression and Cu2þ (R2 ¼ 0.9492) or Cu-NPs (R2 ¼ 0.9860) concentration. The 96-h exposure demonstrated that there was a concentration-response relationship between MT2 expression and Cu2þ and Cu-NPs concentration over that time period. When exposed to Cu2þ or Cu-NPs, MT2 was significantly upregulated compared to controls (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). MT2 gene expression was increased 4.4- and 2.8-fold at the highest concentrations of Cu2þ (40 mg/L) and Cu-NPs (150 mg/L), respectively. The results also showed that Cu2þ was 2.9-fold more toxic than Cu-NPs in terms of MT2 gene expression change in zebrafish larvae.\nIt is well known that the toxic effect of metals tends to decrease with increasing hardness (CaCO3) of the test waters and with the addition of EDTA in the toxicological experiments. In the present study, significantly higher levels of fold change as upregulation (3.2-fold) was observed in the Cu2þ ion effect experiment in larvae sampled after being exposed to 40 mg/L Cu2þ compared to unexposed control larvae in two different experiments (Figure 3). Fold changes were determined in MT2 expression relative to concentration of 40 mg/L Cu2þ, 220 mg/L CaCO3 þ 40 mg/L Cu2þ, and 5 mg/L EDTA þ 40 mg/L Cu2þ in zebrafish larvae (72 hpf) for 96 h. Fold changes in expression were calculated using CT method and MT2 expression was normalized using the housekeeping gene -actin. Results suggested that significant decreases were observed on Cu2þ toxicity to zebrafish larvae in very hard waters (220 mg/L as CaCO3) and in the presence of EDTA (5 mg/L). Increasing water hardness reduced the toxicity of Cu2þ by 61% and EDTA decreased the toxicity of Cu2þ by 44% in terms of gene expression. According to these results, water hardness was more effective reducing agent than EDTA on Cu2þ toxicity in zebrafish larvae in terms of MT2 gene expression (p < 0.05).\nMT2 gene expression in zebrafish larvae is relative to the Cu-NPs exposure series, 220 mg/L CaCO3 associated with Cu-NPs series, and 5 mg/L EDTA associated with Cu-NPs series after 96-h exposure (Figure 4). Regression analysis results demonstrated that there was a strong positive linear relationship between MT2 expression with Cu-NPs concentration series (R2 ¼ 0.9403), CaCO3 associated with Cu-NPs series (R2 ¼ 0.9499), and EDTA associated with Cu-NPs series (R2 ¼ 0.8634) over 96 h. While there was increasing Cu-NPs toxicity in very hard water, a decreasing trend was detected in the presence of EDTA relative to just Cu-NPs series in zebrafish larvae in terms of MT2 gene expression change. Increasing water hardness increased the toxicity of Cu-NPs by 19% and EDTA decreased the toxicity of Cu-NPs by 42% in terms of MT2 gene expression. However, the results showed that, unlike the previous Cu2þ experiment, increasing water hardness increased the toxicity of Cu-NPs. It is believed that this is due to the fact that the NP state of the metals shows different physicochemical properties than their normal state."

      "heading" : "Discussion",
      "text" : "This research showed the impact of Cu-NPs on larval zebrafish and compared its toxicity with Cu2þ to understand the toxic mechanism of insoluble Cu with the help of biomarker gene (MT2) expression. It also investigated the effect of the calcium hardness (as\nCaCO3) and chelating agent EDTA on the Cu toxicity by assessing MT2 gene expression in zebrafish larvae.\nIn the present study, logistic regression analysis was used to model mortality data and to investigate the applicability of concentration addition and independent action models to explain observed mortality. When comparing the 96-h LC50 values of Cu-NPs and Cu2þ, it was found that the toxicity of Cu-NPs was less than that of Cu2þ. This outcome was in accordance with previous works on the toxicities of soluble Cu ions, CuO-NPs, and Cu-NPs (Bai and Tang, 2020; Boyle et al., 2020; Griffitt et al., 2007; Lanone et al., 2009; Thit et al., 2017). This study hypothesized that the differences between toxicity of Cu-NPs and Cu2þ to larval zebrafish should be due to the physicochemical properties of Cu-NPs.\nAn important system that controls the concentration of metals in cells is the MT protein system. MTs control the concentration of metal ions by binding or releasing when necessary (Maret, 2009). They are induced by toxic metals such as silver, nickel, and cadmium, or essential trace elements such as Cu and Zn (Boran and Şaffak, 2018; Boran and Ulutas, 2016; Kimura and Itoh, 2008). There are four major isoforms of MT genes in mammals, among which MT1 and MT2 function in non-neural tissues to detoxify heavy metals, regulate Cu and Zn homeostasis, and restrict oxidative damage (Cho et al., 2009). In the present study, Cu2þ and Cu-NPs caused a significant induction of MT2 gene. Cu2þ induced MT2 levels much greater (2.9-fold) than that from exposure to Cu-NPs in zebrafish larvae. The higher induction of MT2 appeared to be related to a higher accumulation of Cu in larvae. As it is well known, larval uptake of Cu would be waterborne through the gills and uptake by the intestine (Minghetti et al., 2010). Because the zebrafish larvae are also egg-yolk bearing, intestinal uptake might thus be minimal. It was demonstrated that Cu-NPs could be utilized by the gills of zebrafish not only by dissolution (Griffitt et al., 2007) and particularly for Cu-NPs. Moreover, Cu-NPs could be increased to dissolve into Cuþ and Cu2þ ions by altering the pH and salt components in the seawater (Palmer et al., 2004). Even with the higher levels of CTR1 in zebrafish larvae, Cu2O-NPs can also induce more ATP7A and B, which would maintain Cu homeostasis and help with the Cu efflux (Chen et al., 2011). For this reason, Cu accumulation in the larval zebrafish exposed to Cu-NPs was not much greater than that when exposed to Cu2þ, when comparing the difference between MT2 expression.\nThe results of the present study demonstrated that toxicity of Cu2þ decreased with increasing water hardness, but toxicity of Cu-NPs increased with increasing water hardness so that water hardness had a significant effect on Cu toxicity on fish. Cu2þ was more toxic in soft water than in hard water. Calcium has been considered to be the more important hardness cation relative to competition with Cu for binding sites on biotic ligands (e.g. fish). For example, several studies have reported that hardness, consisting primarily of calcium, is protective for both fish (Erickson et al., 1996; Naddy et al., 2002; Terzi and Verep, 2012; Welsh et al., 2000) and invertebrates (De Schemphelaere and Janssen, 2002; Naddy et al., 2002). Although, calcium is essential for survival, it has also been considered to be an important cation that can chemically compete for Cu-biotic ligand binding sites in fish.\nThe present work showed that EDTA, when added to the Cu2þ and Cu-NPs media, significantly reduced Cutoxicity in water and MT2 gene expression in zebrafish larvae as compared to larvae exposed to Cu alone. This suggests that EDTA can bind with Cu2þ ions in experimental media and create a stable ion (Cu2þ) exchanged EDTA complex, leaving a minimal number of free ions in water and thus reducing the chance for metal uptake by larvae. Perhaps, the chelating agent eliminated not only the accumulated Cu, but also all the trace metals like Cu that already existed in the body, which are physiologically essential. Some studies clearly demonstrated a reduction of Cu toxicity due to the complex formed by EDTA in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata (Khangarot, 1981), anammox bacteria (Gonzalez-Estrella et al., 2017), and larval mussels, Perna canaliculus (McDougall et al., 2019). These results also agree with data for other chelating agents that protect salmonid fish against Cu-Zn toxicity (Sprague, 1964). Some antipollutants such as sodium thiosulfate and sodium citrate were used for the reduction of toxicity of copper salts (Shaw and Brown, 1974), but EDTA was the best on account of its stronger chelating capacity (Sprague, 1964).\nThe extensive uses of nanomaterials have resulted in uncertainties concerning their environmental effects. As partial dissolution of metal-based NPs may occur, it is important to distinguish the toxic effects of NPs from pollutant metals and determine the toxic effects of these materials in water by biomarker gene (MT2) expression in zebrafish. In the present study, Cu-NPs and Cu2þ upregulated mRNA levels of MT2\nin a concentration-dependent manner, meaning that this gene can be a potential biomarker to determine Cu pollution in the aquatic environment.\nIn conclusion, CaCO3 and EDTA can reduce metal toxicity (in this case Cu2þ and Cu-NPs) within the aqueous phase and affect the behavior and bioavailability of metals in organisms located in specific environmental compartments. This finding is environmentally relevant and of toxicological concern. The present research determined the toxicity of Cu-NPs and compared it with that of Cu2þ. The Cu-NPs produced a toxic effect on larval zebrafish separate from the well-known effects of soluble Cu. The results showed that while Cu-NPs induced MT2 expression, the differences in concentration relationships of MT2 expression between Cu-NPs and CuSO4 indicated that factors other than release of Cu ions from Cu-NPs influenced the acute toxicity of Cu-NPs. The results also suggest that CaCO3 and EDTA were effective chelating agents in reducing the toxicity of Cu in fish. While CaCO3 and EDTA may reduce metal toxicity in aquatic organisms, their chelating activity in the environment requires further consideration in environmental risk assessment. This study also highlights the need for integrated toxicological evaluations and suggests that existing regulations for soluble Cu may not adequately address the safety concerns associated with metal-based NPs. Moreover, the zebrafish embryolarvae system is useful for assessing the toxic effects of NPs in concert with a biomarker of gene expression."

    "abstractText" : "Metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) can release metal ions that are toxic to aquatic organisms; however, whether the toxicity is from metal ions rather than unique “nano-scale” effects of the NPs is unresolved. The present study aimed to compare the toxicity of Cu2þ and Cu-NPs in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to clarify whether toxic effects are attributable to release of Cu ions and to determine the effect of the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and calcium hardness (as CaCO3) on the Cu toxicity. First, the acute toxicity (96-h lethality) of Cu-NPs was determined in comparison to aqueous Cu in larvae exposed to CuSO4, and subsequently, sublethal tests with Cu-NPs and CuSO4 were conducted with additions of EDTA or calcium ions to evaluate alterations in expression of metallothionein-2 (MT2) gene transcripts (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). Acute toxicity of Cu in larvae exposed to CuSO4 was greater (LC50 1⁄4 226 mg Cu/L) than for larvae exposed to Cu-NPs (LC50 1⁄4 648 mg Cu/L). The expression of MT2 increased with Cu concentration (p < 0.05), and the slope of the linear regression was significantly greater in fish exposed to CuSO4 (slope 1⁄4 0.090) compared to Cu-NPs (slope 1⁄4 0.011). Cu2þ was 2.9-fold more toxic than Cu-NPs. The presence of 5 mg/L EDTA and 220 mg/L CaCO3 significantly reduced the expression of MT2 (1.8-fold for EDTA, 2.3-fold for CaCO3) in larvae exposed to CuSO4. For larvae exposed to Cu-NPs, the presence of EDTA reduced the expression of MT2 (1.7-fold) relative to Cu-NP concentration. While Cu-NPs induced MT2 expression, the differences in concentration relationships of MT2 expression between Cu-NPs and CuSO4 indicated that factors other than release of Cu ions from Cu-NPs influenced acute toxicity of Cu-NPs. The conclusion drawn from this ecotoxicological risk assessment was that EDTA and calcium significantly decreased Cu toxicity in freshwater fish.",
