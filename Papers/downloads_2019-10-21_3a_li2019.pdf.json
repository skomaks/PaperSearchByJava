Introduction bioadhesion resistance. The research has realistic significances in\nAA5052 have attracted extensive interests in engineering researches, daily lives and industrial productions [1,2]. Especially in oceanic fields, they have been used as engineering plates, structural parts and welding components [3,4]. Generally, oxidation layers naturally develop to resist substrate corrosion [5,6]. However, under marine environments, active anions easily erode protective layers leading to metallic failures [7]. Moreover, microbial adhesion is also a common problem causing material invalidations [8].\nTo improve corrosion resistance of Al alloys, arc spraying [9], oxidation process [10], ageing treatment [11], laser process [12], alloying technology [13] and some other protection strategies [14,15] have been reported. It is well-known that the resulting microstructural array has also an important role in bothmechanical and corrosion behavior of a number of Al-based alloys [16e20]. In this sense, the microstructural refinement level and cathode-toanode area ratio constituted will strongly affect the mechanicalto-corrosion response [16e20]. Nevertheless, laser process is costly and unmanageable. Coating treatments with heavy metal ions usually pollute environment. Ageing and oxidation technologies are complicated, and sophisticated equipment are necessary. Hence, simple, green and economic anti-corrosion strategies for Al alloys are highly anticipated.\nEnlightened by lotus leaves [21e24], super-hydrophobic surfaces prevent interactions with aggressive chlorides leading to greatly depressed corrosion rates. Therefore, water-repellent preparations are new-fashioned and effective anti-corrosion strategies for Al alloys. Generally, a super-hydrophobic surface with a small sliding angle (SA< 10 ) and a big static contact angle (CA> 150 ) can be attained by fabricating micro-nano structures and low-surfaceenergy layers [25e28]. By now, many AM methods have been reported to prepare super-hydrophobic structures on Al alloys for resisting corrosions, such as deposition [29], grafting [30], sol-gel process [31], hydrothermal synthesis [32], spinning [33], spraying [34] and in suit polymerisation [35]. Besides, multi-step processes have also been developed to protect Al alloys from corrosions. Liu et al. [36], Wang et al. [37] and Wu et al. [38] have reported waterrepellent Al sheets with enhanced corrosion resistance via multistep etching, anodization and modification. Rezayi et al. [39] have fabricated a multifunctional Al surface with super-hydrophobicity andcorrosionresistancevia immersion,ultrasoundandmodification.\nHowever, for AM methods, the incorporation of dissimilar metals (such as deposition and spraying) accelerates corrosion failures of Al alloys, and additive polymers (such as grafting, spinning, sol-gel and synthesis) cannot offer a long-term structural stability. Meanwhile, multi-step anti-corrosion processes are complicated and costly, which limit their practical applications. Further, anti-corrosion mechanisms of various wetting states (hydrophilic, hydrophobic and super-hydrophobic) have rarely been systematically investigated. Based on these, developing low-cost SM methods to achieve stable super-hydrophobic structures with durable anti-corrosion behaviors has great practical values.\nHerein, a low-cost, facile and large-scale SM process of superhydrophobic AA5052 sheet is achieved by electron discharge machining (EDM) strategy. Anti-corrosion tests and mechanisms of as-fabricated surfaces with various wetting states in seawater are investigated through interfacial interactions. Structural stability and durability are also examined. Additionally, as a typical marine microorganism, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) is used to assess its\nbroadening engineering applications of AA5052 sheets as barriers against corrosions."

      "text" : "Fig. 2 shows micro topographies of AA5052 substrate and\nmachined surface. Visibly, a comparatively smooth substrate with slight grinding cracks is available (Fig. 2a). After EDMprocess, micro craters at a size range of 10e20 mm are observed (Fig. 2b). Magnifying SEM images are used for revealing nanostructures (Fig. 2cee). As shown, nano-scale terraces (Fig. 2e) take shape on micro craters leading to hierarchical features. The formation of such structures is a result of localized fusion and evaporation of Al alloy substrate imposed by electrical discharges, as shown in Fig. 2f. Weak phases and dislocation defects are susceptible to discharges than other sites in crystal Al alloys. Hence, defects first melt leaving terrace structures exposure to surface. Meanwhile, continuous discharges bring about constant surface fusion and evaporation. Consequently, craters gradually develop on substrate.\nFig. 3 exhibits wetting capabilities of substrate, M-substrate (modified substrate) and M-M-sample (modified machined sample). Clearly, Al alloy substrate is hydrophilic (Fig. 3a). After modification, M-substrate has achieved a hydrophobic CA of 107.5 (Fig. 3b). But for M-M-sample, a super-hydrophobic CA of 161.3 is\navailable (Fig. 3d). SA is also necessary for evaluating wetting behaviors [40]. As shown, no droplet slippage occurs even M-substrate tilts to 90 (Fig. 3c). But a small SA of 3.6 is achieved for MM-sample indicating superior water repellence (Fig. 3e). Hence, super-hydrophobic Al alloy surface is available by preparing hierarchical micro-nano structures. The impacts of solid-air-liquid interfaces on super-hydrophobic capability are also clarified in Cassie-Baxter Equation [41]:\ncosCA ¼ f1 cosq f2 ðf1 þ f2 ¼ 1Þ (1)\nwhere f1 indicates contact ratio between droplet and surface, f2 refers to contact ratio between droplet and air, and q represents intrinsic contact angle of 107.5 . This equation reveals that forM-Msample, themaximalCAof 161.3 signifies adroplet 92.5%contacting with air while 7.5% with prepared surface looking as if a spheriform droplet stands upright on Al alloy surface (Fig. 3f). Awater adhesion test (4 mL) is conducted to evaluate adhesion resistance of M-M-\nhined surface. (f) Schematic diagram of EDM process.\nsample (Fig. 3g). Throughout the test, water drop is adsorbed on a pinhead. As sample keeps rising, a squeezed drop is observed. Note that,whensample shifts down, they lose touchand thedrop remains contact with pinhead. Moreover, there are no droplet residues on sample. This test indicates that M-M-sample shows potential applications as barriers against water adhesion.\nFig. 4adisplays a droplet bounce test onM-M-sample. It is carried out by freely dripping the droplet. As seen, the droplet bounces back and forth on surface before rolling down. Meanwhile, there are no droplet residues on sample. The self-cleaning ability ofM-M-sample is also evaluated in Fig. 4b. Beforehand, fine dusts are uniformly dispersed on sample. With droplets dripping off, they freely roll down and sweep away dusts along traces. Contrastively, for Al alloy substrate, droplets onlywet dusts showing strong viscous behaviors (Fig. 4c). Both the tests indicate thatM-M-sample possesses possible applications as drag-free and self-cleaning materials.\nThe enhanced hydrophobicity is linked with organic chains in FAS modifier. Fig. 5 exhibits contrastive XPS results of machined surface and modified counterpart. Apparently, new peaks of Al 2p\nFig. 4. (a) Snapshots of a droplet impacting M-M-sample. Self\n(74.2 eV), Si 2p (100.9 eV) and F 1s (690.3 eV) are observed after modification. The high-resolution C 1s spectra on modified surface are decomposed into eC-metals (279.8 eV), eCeSi (281.9 eV), eCeC (285.0 eV), eCeO (286.3 eV), eCH2eCF2 (288.7 eV), eCF2 (291.0 eV) and eCF3 (294.0 eV). Si 2p spectra are assigned to SieC bonds (99.7 eV) and SieO bonds (101.9 eV) in FAS molecules. The results indicate that FAS monolayers have been bonded to machined surface after modification process.\nThe self-assembled mechanism of FAS molecule on machined Al alloy surface is also investigated in Fig. 6. During the hydrolytic process, the construction of FAS monolayer starts from ethyl group decomposition. Meanwhile, such monomer is polymerized with hydroxyl on machined surface to assemble FAS molecule in rough structures. Generally, F element possesses electron absorption effect, thus giving CeF group an intense chemical inertia [42]. Furthermore, CH group is effective against OH bond. Hence, low surface energy is achieved for FAS monolayer, which helps to repel water as well as guarantee machined surface superior superhydrophobicity.\n-cleaning behaviors of (b) M-M-sample and (c) substrate."

      "text" : "Fig. 7 depicts polarization curves for characterizing corrosion resistance on Al alloys. In general, a sample with low current density is provided with weak electron-transfer capability as well as advantageous anti-corrosion behavior [43]. After extrapolation fittings, corrosion current densities (icorr) for substrate, M-substrate andM-M-sample are 1.19, 0.70 and 0.31 mA/cm2, respectively. These data indicate that M-M-sample possesses the optimal anticorrosion behavior, followed by M-substrate and then substrate.\nAfter comparisons of icorr, substrate suffers serious erosion. It is a result of chlorine ions eroding metal substrate and causing severely corrosion failures (Fig. 8a). But for M-substrate, anti-corrosion behavior is greatly improved. This is ascribed to the FAS layer against seawater infiltration by preventing interface interactions with chlorides (Fig. 8b). Especially, the machined hierarchical surface plays a key role in trapping air, which serves as a parallel plate capacitor and obstructs interfacial charge transfers (Fig. 8c). Combining with impeditive effect of modified layer, M-M-sample achieves the optimal anti-corrosion behavior.\nEIS curves with Nyquist plots (Fig. 9aec) and Bode plots (Fig. 9dee) are also investigated to assess anti-corrosion behaviors. In a Nyquist plot, a big capacitive reactance arc signifies a strong charge transfer impediment, which indicates a better anticorrosion capacity [44]. As shown, the largest capacitive arc for M-M-sample suggests the best corrosion resistance. Fig. 9d shows various amplitude-frequency curves. As seen, low-frequency impedance modulus for M-M-sample is the largest (about 1.2 104U.cm2), followed by M-substrate (about 8.0 103U$cm2) and then substrate (about 0.4 103U$cm2). For phase-frequency\ncurves (Fig. 9e), Al alloy substrate possesses single time constant (46.5 Hz) relating to interfacial double-layer capacitance between substrate and electrolyte [45]. While for modified surfaces, two time constants at low frequency (26.0 Hz for M-substrate and 12.0 Hz for M-M-sample) and high frequency (822 Hz for M-substrate and 1.23 kHz for M-M-sample) are observed. Note that the highest impedance modulus and lowest time constant at low frequencies indicates the best seawater obstruction for M-M-sample\n[46]. The varying tendencies of Bode plots further suggest the best corrosion resistance for M-M-sample.\nTo accurately determine the electrochemical parameters, ZSimDemo 3.30D Software is used to fit experimental EIS plots. After fittings, the model Rs(Rct1Cdl) in Fig. 10a is suitable for equating electrochemical behaviors of substrate [47]. In this pattern, Rs denotes to solution resistance, Rct1 represents charge transfer resistance, and Cdl is concerned with double layer capacitance. For modified samples, the pattern Rs(Cc(Rc(Cdl(Rct2Ws)))) is found suitable to match their electrochemical behaviors [48], as shown in Fig. 10b. In this pattern, Cc and Rc respectively correspond to capacitance and resistance of modified films. In fact, even for a sealed modified coating, micro-pores inevitably exist thereby promoting ionic penetrations to form corrosive pits, as shown in Fig. 10b. Hence, Ws relating to diffusion resistance is used for depicting impeding capacity of reactant diffusions from solution to substrate [48]. In above models, Cc and Cdl are concerned with constant phase elements (CPE) for illustrating capacitors. The corresponding impedances are expressed as follows [49]:\nZc ¼ Y 1ðjuÞ n (2)\nwhere Y, j, u and n are defined as admittance constant, imaginary number, angular frequency and empirical exponent, respectively.\nAfter fittings, electrochemical parameters of various samples are listed in Table 2. Clearly, small relative standard deviations are\nachieved suggesting reasonable fittings. Meanwhile, the increased impedances and decreased capacitances are observed for substrate, M-substrate and M-M-sample successively. This trend also implies gradually improved charge-transfer resistance and anti-corrosion ability for above samples. Furthermore, coating coverage rate a is also used to assess corrosion resistance [50]:\na ¼ 1 Rct1\nRct2\n100% (3)\nAccording to Eq. (3), the maximum coating coverage of 97.0% for M-M-sample suggests the best corrosion resistance. The maximum diffusion resistance (Ws) of 9.1 10 4U$cm2 also indicates the optimal corrosion resistance for M-M-sample. Fitting plots are also achieved in Fig. 9, which coincide well with experimental curves. From these, the corrosion resistance is greatly enhanced for M-Msample. It is due to the machined hierarchical structures, which is conducive to trapping air and going against seawater infiltration.\nM-M-sample is also prepared with good repellence to acid-base mediums. Fig. 11a exhibits the effect of pH on wetting abilities. As seen, CA and SA remain relatively stable as pH varies suggesting steady liquid repellence in corrosive mediums. Its mechanical stability is evaluated in ultrasound condition (Fig. 11b). After ultrasound for 24 h, M-M-sample maintains super-hydrophobicity. Besides, the stabilities of super-hydrophobic and anti-corrosion behaviors are measured in Fig. 11c and d, respectively. Clearly, after immersion for 30 days, CA, SA, icorr and Ecorr respectively\nettabilities of M-M-sample.

Thus, durable corrosion resistance of M-M-sample arising from its morphology stability (Fig. 11d) is of great potential in broadening possible applications in harsh conditions."

      "text" : "SRB is used to test bacteria inhibition of M-M-sample. Fig. 12 shows microscopic and fluorescent images of bacterial colonies on comparative samples with diverse culture time. Notably, there is almost no bacteria adhesion on M-M-sample (Fig. 12a) with the minimum bacterial coverage of 0.01% (Fig. 12e) after 2 days. However, more bacteria with a higher coverage of 8.35% (Fig. 12e) are seen on Al alloy substrate (Fig. 12b). After 4 days, a small bacterial coverage of 0.97% (Fig. 12e) is achieved for M-M-sample (Fig. 12c). But for substrate (Fig. 12d), the maximum coverage 24.20% (Fig. 12e) suggests serious microbiological adhesion. The test indicates that the machined super-hydrophobic structures exactly restrain SRB adhesion and growth. As mentioned above, such structures can trap air, which greatly reduces interface interactions with bacterial solution (Fig. 12f). Hence, the simple and low-cost SM process has provided a stable and durable strategy to resist microbiological adhesion."
