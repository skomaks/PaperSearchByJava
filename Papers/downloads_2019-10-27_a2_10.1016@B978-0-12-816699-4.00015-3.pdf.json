      "text" : "An important sentence “There is a lot of space down there,” by R. Feynman in 1959, took its place in the history as the first step of nanotechnology. At that time, it was unpredicted that there would be such advanced technological development in this field [1,2].\nIn general, materials in particle size ranging from 10 to 100 nm are classified as nanomaterials (NMs). Because of the different physical and chemical properties of NMs, according to the micro-sized and bulk materials, NMs appear in almost every field—from chemistry to biology, medicine to agriculture, electronics to biotechnology, and food industry to pharmacology [3 5]. Surface energy of small particles and higher surface atoms fraction lead to these unexpected features when compared with micro-sized and bulk materials. High surface atoms fractions that lead to high surface-area-to-volume ratio of NMs are one of the most important features. This situation is related to the presence of more\nactive atoms in the NMs. These more active atoms in the NMs are the most important driving force causing specific affinity and interaction with different free atoms, molecules, and ions [6 10]. High surface area of NMs and special interactions between NMs and different species (atoms, molecules, and ions) lead to high adsorption capacity for different organic, inorganic, and bioactive species [11 13]. NMs also provide easy functionalization and reusability, improved electronic properties, such as high conductivity, fast response to physical event, and chemical reactions.\nDue to these unique features, NMs have taken their place among the most preferred materials in various branches of analytical chemistry, such as sample preparation methods, separation techniques, and qualitative and quantitative analyses [11 14]. In the last few decades, undoubtedly, the most important turning point in the change and development of analytical and bioanalytical sciences has been the use of NMs as sorbent in solid-phase extraction (SPE)/microextraction (SPME)-based sample preparation methods, column filler material in chromatographic systems [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography (GC) MS, LC tandem mass spectrometer (LC MS/MS), etc.], substrate in detection system, and sensing agent in sensor and biosensor systems [15 21].\nNMs can mainly be classified on the basis of dimensionality and chemical form of materials, which is explained in Fig. 15.1, and can also be classified according to different criteria, such as dimensionality, morphology, composition or uniformity, and agglomeration state [22].\nAn alternative, complementary classification may divide nanoparticles (NPs) into two main groups, namely, organic and inorganic, according to their chemical composition. While carbonaceous and polymeric materials are classified as organic NMs, metallic and metal-oxide NMs are classified as inorganic NMs.\nThe main reason for the frequent use of NMs in sample preparation and analysis procedures that form the basis of analytical chemistry is that they can be modified by using different functionalization agents. Modification of NMs with different groups and species provides advantages, such as high affinity and adsorption capacity, against the analytes’ high enrichment factors (EFs), accelerating the adsorption and desorption steps in the separation- and preconcentration-based methods. In addition, it also offers advantages such as improved separation efficiency, easier dispersibility in the liquid phases, low detection limit, fast response time, and selective response signal for chromatographic, spectroscopic, sensor- and biosensorbased separation, and analysis techniques [23 28]. The most commonly used methods in the production and functionalization of NMs are as follows [29 40]: 1. coprecipitation,\n2. reduction or oxidation, 3. solvothermal or hydrothermal procedure, 4. chemical vapor deposition,\n5. physical vapor deposition, 6. electrospinning, 7. thin film formation, 8. surface coating, 9. immobilization,\n10. impregnation, 11. sol gel,\n12. discharge method, 13. laser vaporization, 14. laser ablation, 15. electrochemical polymerization and 16. in situ polymerization."

      "heading" : "15.2.1 Carbon-based nanomaterials",
      "text" : "Carbon-based NMs have been the most commonly used materials in all disciplines, such as energy, chemistry, medicine, health, biotechnology, and pharmacy, since the discovery of fullerene (C60) in 1985 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in 1991 [41 43]. In particular, carbon-based NMs [e.g., fullerenes, CNTs, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanocones graphene, graphene oxide (GO), carbon nanodisks, nanohorns] and their functionalized forms have been preferred as a sorbent in many SPE/SPME methods [44 48]. The SPE/SPME methods based on carbon-based functionalized NMs are frequently used for the separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of organic, inorganic, and bioactive species in environmental, water, biological, food, and pharmaceutical samples. Moreover, these are among the most researched materials of the 21st century.\nFullerenes are soccer ball shaped polyhedral NMs obtained by the coiling of the graphene together. C60, C70, C240, C540, and C720 isomers of fullerenes can be obtained by using more carbon atoms. C60 as the most used isomer has a diameter of approximately 1 nm. A carbon atom in fullerene is bonded to three carbon neighbors by sp2 hybridization in five- to six-membered rings arranged as 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons [49,50].\nCNTs are produced by rolling up graphite sheets into nanoscale tubes [i.e., single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs)] or with additional graphite tubes wrapped around the cores of the first layer of roll of graphite sheets. They are classified as SWCNTs, double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs), and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs). After the discovery of these special nano-carbons, scientists focused on the different applications because of their excellent surface structure, high surface area, and unique mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability. A carbon atom in CNTs is bonded to three carbon neighbors by sp2 hybridization and has π π bonds between carbon atoms. Hence, CNTs can establish π π and van der Waals interactions with atoms, ions, and molecules.\nThese unique properties have made CNTs one of the most widely used adsorbents in SPE/SPME applications. Though SWCNTs, DWCNTs, and MWCNTs are produced from the same carbon source, they show very different adsorption performances because of their different numbers of graphite sheets [51 53]. Nanodiamond (ND) is also a commonly used nano-carbon in laboratory and industry scale due to its unique chemical, mechanical, and physical features, such\nas high surface area, high resistivity to corrosive chemicals, very high hardness, high biocompatibility, high thermal conductivity, and low friction coefficient. Hence, NDs are preferable materials in SPE/SPME applications [54,55].\nGraphene (G) and GO are innovative nano-carbons that marked this century and are called the “mother” of all graphitic carbon materials [56,57]. Graphene fabricated in 2004 has been recorded in the literature as a material that has given its inventor a Nobel Prize. When compared with CNTs, fullerenes, NDs, carbon nanofiber, and other carbon-based NMs, graphene and GO provide more effective and attractive performance for sorption-based sample preparation methods due to their unique properties, such as improved nanosheet morphology, very effective π π interactions toward to analytes especially carbon-based ring structures, and very high specific surface area (i.e., a theoretical value of 2630 m2 g21), which lead to high adsorption capacity for analytes [58 60]. In 2004 carbon dots (carbon quantum dots or C-dots) were recognized by accident while separating SWCNTs from carbon soot using gel electrophoresis. C-dots have been classified as star of nano-carbon allotropes. They gained important interest by scientists due to their effective and preferable properties, such as simple and cheap production with high quantities, great biocompatibility, and excellent optical property. C-dots mainly consist of sp3 and sp2 carbon atoms. Hence, they have a similar structure with graphenic nanosheets, 2D graphene, and 1D CNTs. Although C-dots have been widely used in many areas, such as electronic, bioimaging, and optical application, they are already being used in sample preparation applications [61,62]."

      "heading" : "15.2.1.1.1 Covalent functionalization of carbon-based nanomaterials",
      "text" : "Although all the nano-carbon allotropes described above contain unique properties, the most important properties of them are that they are functionalized by covalent or noncovalent functionalization methods in order to use the desired properties for many applications. The covalent functionalization can be carried out by direct covalent sidewall functionalization with the molecule of interest or by indirect covalent functionalization with carboxylic groups previously introduced on their surface.\nIn many literature studies, it is observed that the covalent functionalization reactions are majorly used procedures consisting of oxidization, hydrogenation, halogenation, cycloaddition, nucleophilic addition, and radical addition. By using these functionalization reactions, a linkage between the carbon skeleton of NMs and the functional groups is formed. As mentioned above, these modifications can occur by direct sidewall functionalization with aid of silanized groups located on the surface of the carbon NMs or indirect functionalization with carboxylic groups located on the defects of the carbon NMs [63 65]. The main disadvantage of covalent functionalization is that the well-organized carbon structure of NM is disturbed, which cause significant changes in their valuable physical or chemical features.\nIn the covalent functionalization, carbon-based NMs are generally oxidized by using strong acids, such as H2SO4 and HNO3, at high temperature. In this way,\nCOOH, OH, and C5O groups are introduced in their structure [63 65]. The NMs have COOH, OH, and C5O groups that can be used directly or modified with desired functional groups by different substitution reactions. After oxidation, these NMs have zero net charge, and “point of zero charge” or “isoelectric point” is formed for these NMs, that is, the surface charges of these oxidized NMs vary with the ambient pH values.\nWhen the pH value of sample solutions is reached to values higher than “point of zero charge” or “isoelectric point,” the surface of oxidized NMs has gained negatively charged. In this case, cationic species, such as metal ions, cationic surfactants, and organic compounds, which have positive charge, can be adsorbed on the surface of NMs by electrostatic interactions. Around point-of-zero-charge region, the surface of oxidized NMs has neutral charge. In this case, van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding are formed between NM and neutral species, such as metal ligand complex and organic compounds. On the contrary, at lower pH values than the point of zero charge, there is a competition between protons and cations for the same sites on oxidized NMs, which cause a decrease in the adsorption. For example, metal ions can be adsorbed on the oxidized surface of NMs at high pH value and eluted by using acidic solutions. Hence, the pH value of solution medium is important and needs optimized factor in SPE/SPME studies.\nMoreover, oxidation process leads to the formation of holes in the NMs. In this manner, inorganic and organic species in solution phase can be entered into these holes and retained.\nSPE methods are generally used in the separation and enrichment of trace analytes found in aqueous media. Therefore dispersion of sorbents in the aqueous phase is one of the most critical processes.\nAs the hydrophobic properties of the pristine carbon NMs are dominant, it is very difficult to disperse in the aqueous medium. In this way the modification results in a significant increase in extraction efficiency by allowing the NMs to be dispersed easily in the aqueous medium. In general, functionalized CNTs are easier to disperse than the corresponding pristine materials, therefore facilitating their characterization and purification.\nIn many cases the oxidation is just the previous step to the immobilization of different molecules. Covalent modification of NMs with complexing agents, organic compounds, polymers, and extraction solvents has an important place in SPE/SPME applications. Some examples of the applications of oxidized and covalent-modified carbon-based NMs for adsorption-based separation and enrichment studies in the literature are explained later.\nSun et al. prepared carboxylated MWCNTs (MWCNTs-COOH) as dispersive SPE (d-SPE) sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of pyrethroid pesticides prior to their GC electron capture detector (ECD) detections. They optimized the d-SPE method and used seven pyrethroid pesticides at trace level in carrot cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and spinach samples for analysis. The d-SPE/GC ECD procedure provided high extraction efficiency between 88.5% and\n108.2%, low limit of detection (LOD) (0.5 2.9 μg kg21), and limit of quantification (LOQ) (1.5 9.7 μg kg21) values [66].\nLópez-Feria et al. checked the applicability of MWCNTs and carboxylated SWCNTs (SWCNTs-COOH) for SPE of atrazine, chlortoluron, simazine, diuron, terbuthylazin-desethyl, malathion parathion and dimethoate pesticides at trace level in virgin olive oil samples. They filled 30 mg of CNT sorbents in a cartridge to prepare SPE system. Analytes sorbed on the CNTs were eluted with 500 μL of ethyl acetate, and the eluent volume was evaporated until 50 μL by nitrogen stream. Concentrations of analytes were analyzed with the GC MS method. They used these prepared SPE column system at least 100 times, which performed successfully every time. The developed procedure provides LOD between 1.5 and 3.0 μg L21 [67]. Sun et al. used carboxylated SWCNT fibers as a SPME sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of many chlorophenols (CPs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in aqueous samples followed by GC ECD detections. They used sol gel-coating procedure to fabricate carboxylated SWCNT fibers. In this procedure a sol gel solution was prepared by mixing 120 mg of TSO-OH, 200 μL of dichloromethane, 150 μL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 15 mg of methylhydrosiloxane (PMHS), 80 μL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and 5% of water. Next, the sol gel coating was formed on the outer surface of the fused-silica fiber by vertically immersing fiber into the prepared sol gel solution, and then the fiber was left to interact with the carboxylated SWNTs in dichloromethane solution. The carboxylated SWCNT fibers were dried before SPE application. The carboxylated SWCNT fibers showed more effective sensitivity and selectivity than commercial SPME fibers. The SPME/GC ECD procedure was applied to analyze CPs and OCPs in lake and wastewater samples, with high recovery results (89.7% 101.2%) [68]. Kueseng and Pawliszyn fabricated a MWCNTs-COOH/polydimethylsiloxane (MWCNTs-COOH/PDMS) coating thin film as a new 96-blade SPME system for trace amount of phenolic compounds prior to HPLC ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) determination. In this synthesis procedure, MWCNTs-COOH particles (5%, w/w of PDMS) were dispersed in dichloromethane solution by sonication for 3 min. Then, 3 g of PDMS prepolymer was added into the solution including MWCNTs-COOH and sonicated for 5 min to disperse into the prepolymer. Next, the coating procedure was carried out by immersing of 2 cm portions of each pin into the MWCNTsCOOH/PDMS mixture for 5 s. The coated blade was cured in an oven at 150 C. The extraction and analysis procedure provided acceptable extraction performance between 64% and 90% with relative standard deviation (RSD)# 6% and low LOD between 1 and 2 μg L21. Moreover, when compared with traditional methods, the MWCNTs-COOH/PDMS 96-blade SPME apparatus has better performance, such as simple and easy applicability, cheap and easy coating procedure, and high reusability (minimum 110 extraction application) [69].\nKou and Liang carried out a comparative SPE method for the separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of bisphenol and tetrabromobisphenol A prior to LC MS MS determinations. For this purpose, they compared SPE performances\nof MWCNTs, carboxyl-functionalized MWCNTs, and fullerenes and decided to use carboxyl-functionalized MWCNTs as sorbent. They applied the developed SPE method for determining trace amounts of bisphenol and tetrabromobisphenol A in lake water and sea water samples with good recoveries between 82% and 99% with the RSD, 5.0% [70]. Chang et al. introduced a microwave-assisted surface functionalization method to obtain carboxyl and carbonyl-modified diamond NPs. In this synthesis procedure, diamond nanopowders were added into an oxidized acid solution consisting of HNO3 and H2SO4 (1:3, v/v), and the mixture was irritated by microwave radiation at 100 W power. The temperature was set to 100 C and was applied for 3 h. In the polyarginine-coated diamond NP preparation step, an 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC)-mediated coupling reaction was used as follows: carboxyl-modified diamond NPs were mixed with a solution containing EDC (22 mg mL21, 63.7 μL), polyarginine (4 mg mL21, 155 μL), and H3BO3/NaOH buffer (5 mM, pH 8.5). The mixture was shaken gently for 2 h at room temperature and the prepared polyarginine-coated diamond NPs were washed and dried. The new sorbent was used for the extraction of phosphorylated peptides from complex samples and selective preconcentration of multiphosphorylated peptides prior to direct matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass-spectrometric detections. The new sorbent has shown an effective affinity for multiphosphorylated peptides because of the multiple arginine phosphate interactions. The developed method provided the analysis of 50 μL of sample containing nonfat milk, α-casein, and r-casein at a concentration as low as 13 1029 M [71]. Similar synthesis method was used for the fabrication of polylysine-coated diamond NMs as sorbent for the separation, preconcentration, and digestion of DNA oligonucleotides in one microcentrifuge tube prior to MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometric analysis (MS) [72]. Kong et al. fabricated carboxylated/oxidized diamond NPs by oxidizing them and using them for the extraction and analysis of proteins followed by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometric (MS) analysis [72].\nSilane groups, such as (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), (3-chloropropyl)-trimethoxysilane, N-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) ethylenediamine (TMSPEDA), N1-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) diethylenetriamine (TMSPDETA), and 3- methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, are frequently used as coupling agent for covalent modification of NMs. Many desired functional groups are covalently attached to NMs via these silane groups [73 77]. Suárez et al. immobilized carboxylated SWCNTs (COOH-SWCNTs) onto porous glass in a different SPE application. In the synthesis procedure, they oxidized SWCNTs with 20 mL of H2SO4:HNO3 (3:1) solution by using ultrasonic irritation (50 W, 60 Hz) for 90 min. Then, the obtained carboxylated SWCNT particles were washed with ultrapure water and dried. In order to obtain silanized glass surface, cleaned glass sample was mixed with a known volume of 3-amino propyl triethoxy silane and 0.05 M mL ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) and heated at 80 C in a water bath for 2 h. After this reaction time, the mixture was filtered on 0.45 μm filters, washed and dried at 95 C. Next, the obtained silanized glass was added into a solution including 0.6 mL of glutaraldehyde and 5 mL of 0.1 M orthophosphate at\npH 8.5 and was mixed until the completion of reaction. In the last step, the obtained activated glass and COOH-SWCNTs were mixed together in a 3 mL dimethylformamide solution containing 0.7 mg of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide for 5 h. The prepared COOH-SWCNT-modified glass was washed, dried, and characterized by atomic and electron microscopy methods [73].\nLv et al. modified GO and silica particles with three different kinds of silane coupling agents, including APTES, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and (3-chloropropyl)-trimethoxysilane. The functionalized materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and Zetasizer Nano ZSP. The authors used these new materials for ultrasonic-assisted d-SPE of sulfamerazine and sulfameter. The obtained results showed that the (3-chloropropyl)-trimethoxysilane-modified GO had a good and better sorption and extraction performance than other materials for the separation and preconcentration of sulfonamides in milk samples with high extraction efficiencies between 92.16% and 103.81% and RSDs lower than 3.20%. After d-SPE, concentrations of analytes were measured with HPLC [74].\nSitko et al. prepared aminosilanized GO (GO-NH2) by modifying GO with APTES for selective preconcentration of Pb(II) ions. In the synthesis procedure, the authors used Hummers’ method for fabrication of GO. The obtained GO particles were added into anhydrous ethanol and dispersed. Then, 10 mL of APTES was added to the suspension and the mixture was heated at 70 C for 4 h. The obtained aminosilanized GO material was characterized by SEM, Raman, x-ray diffractometer (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) methods. Pb(II) ions were adsorbed on the surface of GO-NH2-like complex formation. After dispersive micro-SPE step, Pb(II) ions sorbed on the GO-NH2 material were measured directly by injecting the suspended GO-NH2 into graphite tube for electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Modification of GO with APTES provided excellent dispersibility in aqueous samples, which lead to very effective interaction with Pb(II) ions with very fast adsorption. The developed method provided low LOD of 9.4 ng L21 and high preconcentration factor of 100 [75]. Huang et al. used a hydrothermal synthesis procedure to modify graphene with APTES. The fabricated graphene-APTES material was used for SPE of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at trace level in environmental water samples prior to HPLC determinations. The authors used only 10 mg of sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of PAHs traces from 100 mL of sample solution due to high surface area and high adsorption capacity of NMs. The developed method provided high extraction efficiency changing from 84.6% to 109.5% for PAHs [76].\nIn a different application, GO was modified with APTES, TMSPEDA, and TMSPDETA. These three different obtained materials were used for selective SPE of hexavalent chromium traces at pH 3.5. The amount of amino silanes attached to GO decreases in the order of APTES.TMSPEDA.TMSPDETA. Hence the APTES-modified GO was used for selective and sensitive SPE of Cr(VI) ions prior to low-power energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF) analysis. The method was used for the analysis of Cr(VI) in water samples with recoveries of 99.76 2.2 [77].\nXiao et al. prepared a new coating material, polymeric fullerene, for modifying the fibers in SPME apparatus. The obtained SPME apparatus was used in the headspace SPE method for the separation and preconcentration of naphthalene congeners, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), and phthalic acid diesters in water samples. Concentrations of analytes in the last phase were measured by GC flame ionization detection (FID) detection system [78]. In a different application, polysilicone fullerene coating material was prepared for SPME and determination of trace amounts of semivolatile compounds. fullerene polymers was fabricated by the reaction of excess of fullerene (C60) with ω-azido-undecyl-polymethylsiloxane in reflux system. Then, the prepared PF was coated on the commercial PDMS of 100 μm thickness. When compared with the PDMS, the new fibers showed better sensitivity, selectivity, and extraction performance; thermal stability; and life span [78]. Yu et al. used sol gel method to fabricate hydroxyfullerenecoated SPME fiber. Fullerol (fullerene polysiloxane) was prepared by the reaction of C60 with aqueous NaOH and H2O2 in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. They used IR and SEM methods for the characterization of new material. The prepared headspace SPME apparatus was used for the separation and preconcentration of polar aromatic amines, PAHs, and polychlorinated biphenyls prior to GC FID and GC electron capture detection [79]. Vallant et al. prepared aminosilica-modified fullerene for SPE of proteins, peptides, and flavonoids with recoveries of B99%. In the production of sorbent, fullerenoacetic acid and epoxyfullerenes were reacted with (aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane in the reflux system [80]. Vallant et al. synthesized dioctadecyl methano fullerene, fullerenoacetic acid, and iminodiacetic acid fullerene materials from pristine fullerene by using different chemical reactions. The new materials were used for the extraction and preconcentration of serum compounds prior to MALDI MS/MS analysis [81]. Complexing agents, such as 5-aminosalicylic acid, 4-(2-thiazolylazo)resorcinol (TAR), 8-hydroxyquinoline, eriochrome black T, 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol, dithizone, 1,5-diphenylthiocarbazone, ethylenediamine, (5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5(diethylamino)phenol, 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol, 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, are frequently used for selective retention of trace heavy metal ions on the sorbent surface. It has been reported in many studies that the extraction efficiencies and adsorption capacities of heavy metal ions increased with the nonreversible covalent modification of the surfaces of NMs with these complexing agents [82 90]. Soliman et al. fabricated 5-aminosalicylic acid modified MWCNTs by covalent immobilization [82]. In the fabrication procedure, pristine MWCNTs were converted to MWCNTs-COOH by a well-known oxidization method. Pristine MWCNTs were reacted with a concentrated mixture of H2SO4/HNO3 in an ultrasonic bath at 55 C for 7 h, and the obtained MWCNTs-COOH particles were washed with ultrapure water and dried in an oven. In the second step, N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) was used to link MWCNTs-COOH particles to 5- aminosalicylic acid. For this purpose, 2 mmol of 5-ASA (amino salicylic acid), 2.0 g of DCC, and 2.0 g of MWCNTs-COOH were mixed in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, and the obtained mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature.\nThe fabricated MWCNTs-5-ASA material was characterized by scanning electron microscope, FT-IR spectroscopy, and surface coverage determination and was used for the separation and preconcentration of Pb(II) traces prior to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. Trace Pb(II) ions in aqueous sample solution (pH 4.0) were preconcentrated on 50 mg of the new fabricated sorbent and eluted with 4.0 mL of 2 M HNO3. After optimization step, the developed SPE method was applied to water samples [82].\nIn a different complexing agent immobilization procedure, Madadizadeh et al. produced 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol-modified MWCNTs in two steps [83]. Pristine MWCNTs were first oxidized with concentrated HNO3 and then reacted with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol in a reflux system. The prepared sorbent was used for SPE of trace amount of Cd(II) ions followed by ETAAS determination. Preconcentration factor, LOD, and RSD values for Cd(II) ions were found as 300, 0.14 ng L21, and 6 3.6%, respectively. The developed SPE-ETAAS procedure was used for the analysis of cadmium in different water samples [83]. Tajik and Taher used similar oxidization and complexing agent modification reactions to link 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphtol (PAN) on the surface of MWCNTs. The prepared PAN-MWCNT sorbent was used for the separation and preconcentration of Zn(II) ions in aqueous sample solutions (pH 5) prior to its flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS) analysis. Preconcentration factor, LOD, and RSD values for Zn(II) ions were found as 250, 0.07 pg mL21, and 6 1.2%, respectively. The suggested method was successfully applied to biological and water samples [84]. A different research group prepared PAN-modified MWCNTs with similar covalent modification method and used it as a sorbent for SPE of Co(II) ions at trace level [85].\nMoghimi and Siahkalrodi modified graphene material with N-methyl-glycine and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde by using a reflux synthesis unit. The prepared material was used as a sorbent for selective SPE of Pb(II) ions. After SPE stage, the concentration of lead in eluent phase was measured with FAAS [86]. Madadrang et al. linked ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDTA) on the GO surfaces through a silanization reaction between N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl) ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDTA-silane) and hydroxyl groups on GO surface. The new sorbent has shown selective sorption properties for Pb(II) ions at pH 6.8 [87].\nPytlakowska et al. prepared 2,20-iminodiacetic acid modified GO sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of Pb(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Cr(III) traces from water samples by applying dispersive micro-SPE procedure. Their modification method is based on the nucleophilic substitution of dimethyl-2,20-iminodiacetate hydrochloride to the surface of GO. Heavy metal ions preconcentrated on the sorbent at pH 6.5 were analyzed by EDXRF. The adsorption capacities of new sorbent were found as 108.4, 117.1, 80.7, and 119.6 mg g21 for Cu(II), Cr(III), Pb(II), and Zn(II) ions, respectively [88].\nZhao et al. prepared two different complexing agents (single- and double-arm amide thiourea) and used them for covalent modification of ND particles. These two sorbents were used for selective sorption of uranium ions. In the functionalization method the synthesized single-arm or double-arm amide thiourea complexing\nagent was reacted with oxidized NDs in a reflux system. The obtained results showed that the prepared two sorbents have very fast adsorption kinetics for uranium (equilibrium time: 2 min), high adsorption capacities (B200 mg g21), and great selectivities for uranium (between 72% and 82%) [89].\nIn a different application, MWCNT was oxidized and chemically functionalized by 3-hydroxy-4-((3-silylpropylimino) methyl) phenol to produce an effective sorbent for SPE of Fe31, Cu21, Zn21, Ni21, Co21, and Pb21 ions [90].\nPolymeric nanocomposites consisting of inorganic NPs and organic polymers are a new strategy to obtain innovative materials that provide desired properties, and these nanocomposites show better performance than their microparticle counterparts and might lead to improved physical and chemical properties. Modification of NMs with polymers might provide selective extraction of analyte(s) and high adsorption capacities for analytes due to their highly branched structure that consists of many reactive organic functional groups, well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) molecular configuration, and large internal and external surfaces. Moreover, they provide high chemical stability toward corrosive solutions, such as H2SO4 and HNO3, and high thermal stability for thermal desorption stages in SPE/SPME applications [91 98]. Modification of carbon NMs with different polymers as covalent is an important task for the fabrication of SPE/SPME sorbents. These reactions are called polymergrafting reactions and can be carried out by two different ways: (1) high reactive polymers can react directly with NMs, which have a bonding agent, such as carboxy, amine, silane, and hydroxy functional groups. (2) NMs, which have bonding agents, such as carboxy, amine, silane, and hydroxy functional groups, act as a polymer initiator with a monomer M1, and, in a second step, copolymerization with a M2 monomer synthesis polymer modified NMs (NMs-(M1)m-(M2)n) (where m and n are the degrees of polymerization). In the second strategy, monomers are bonded on the surface of NMs as radical covalently. Chemical defect functionalization is the most suitable and more preferred method than sidewall functionalization. The use of NMs, which have oxygen-containing groups on their surface, is the most preferred strategy because of the great variety of reactions of oxygen groups [91 98]. Behbahani et al. fabricated polypropylene amine dendrimers (POPAM) grafted MWCNT hybrid material as sorbent. The synthesis procedure consists of three stages: (1) oxidized MWCNTs (MWCNTs-COOH) were converted to MWCNTsCOCl in the SOCl2 and DMF medium by heating at 80 C for 50 h, (2) MWCNTsNH2 was produced by the reaction of MWCNTs-COCl with NaN3 at 100 C in DMF medium, and (3) the generation of first, second, and third POPAM on the amino-functionalized MWCNTs. The new material was used for SPE of Au(III) and Pd(II) traces from the aqueous phase prior to their AAS determinations [91].\nZhang et al. modified MWCNTs covalently with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) by using acryloyl-β-cyclodextrin (acryloyl-β-CD) and methacrylic acid (MAA) as the binary functional monomers and erythromycin as the template. This synthesis procedure consisted of five successive steps: (1) formation of carboxyl group on the surface of MWCNTs (MWCNTs-COOH) by oxidizing with acids, (2) synthesis of MWCNTs-COCl in SOCl2 medium by reflux system at 60 C for 24 h,\n(3) synthesis of MWCNTs from MWCNTs-COCl in the presence of APTES and vinyltriethoxysilane, (4) production of acryloyl-β-cyclodextrins, and (5) reaction of MWCNTs particles with acryloyl-β-cyclodextrins in the presence of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and α,α0-azoisobutyronitrile [92]. The characterization studies for this new material were carried out by using techniques such as FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM and TEM results showed that the average thickness of the MIP layer on the surface of MWCNTs was approximately 25 nm. The new sorbent was used for the separation and preconcentration of erythromycin from chicken muscle prior to its HPLC-UV detection.\nTan et al. fabricated MIP-modified membrane-protected MWCNTs as a sorbent system for the separation and preconcentration of triazine at trace level in water and milk samples. In the microextraction application, MWCNTs-MIP prepared was set inside a polypropylene membrane envelope and then was clamped onto a paper clip. For extraction, the prepared membrane was first impregnated with toluene and later immersed in sample solutions. Analytes sorbed on the MWCNTs-MIP were desorbed and analyzed by LC analysis. In the fabrication of this new sorbent, MWCNTs-COOH particles were converted to MWCNTs-CH25CH2 and then prometryn MWCNTs-MIPs were fabricated by the copolymerization of MAA and 3- (trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate in the presence of prometryn on the surface of MWCNTs-CH25CH2 [93]. In a different application, Chen et al. modified MWCNTs with MIPs by using 4- vinylpyridine and MAA as bifunctional monomers. As in previously described methods, pristine MWCNTs were converted to MWCNTs-COOH by oxidizing acids and then MWCNTs-COCl with thionyl chloride by reflux system at 80 C for 24 h. MWCNTs CONHCH5CH2 was obtained by the reaction of MWCNTs-COCl with acrylamide [94]. In the last step, 200 mg of MWCNTs CONHCH5CH2 was mixed in a solution including 0.1421 g of rhein, 0.1722 g of MAA, 0.2028 g of 4-VP, and DMF for 0.5 h, and then 1.982 g of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 30 mg of 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile, and DMF were added into the first mixture, and the obtained second mixture was purged with nitrogen and left for polymerization at 60 C in a water bath. The prepared MWCNTs-MIP was used as a sorbent for SPE of trace amount of rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone2-carboxylic acid). The concentration of rhein in eluent was analyzed with HPLC [94].\nKibechu et al. modified reduced GO with pyrene-imprinted polymer to obtain new GO-MIPs as an SPE material for the separation and preconcentration of PAHs in water samples. After extraction, analyses were carried out by GC TOF/MS. The new GO-MIP sorbent was produced by a free-radical polymerization of 4- vinylpyridine and MAA monomers and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross-linker. They analyzed PAHs in water samples with recoveries between 73% and 105.4%. The new sorbent was used at least five times, which performed successfully every time [95].\nSedghi et al. prepared GO@MIP composite by using the GO sheets as polymerization surface, acrylamide and β-cyclodextrin as functional monomers,\ndiphenylamine (DPA) as target molecule, N,N-methylene bisacrylamide as crosslinker, and azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator. The new composite was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), SEM, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) methods. Host guest interactions between cyclodextrin-based polymer and diphenylamine by the inclusion complex through the interaction of DPA and β-CD lead to high extraction efficiency. The innovative GO@MIP sorbent provided highly improved imprinting effect, high adsorption capacity, and fast adsorption kinetic [96].\nCheng et al. fabricated a novel GO-MIPs for dispersive SPME of trace amount of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in environmental water samples prior to its HPLC-UV determination. They used precipitation-polymerization method. In this method, GO, MAA, ethylene dimethacrylate, and DEHP were used as supporting materials, functional monomer, cross-linker, and template molecules, respectively. The developed d-SPME method was applied to analyze DEHP in environmental water samples with good recoveries (82% 92%). EFs of over 100-fold with the LOD of 0.92 ng mL21 were obtained [97].\nLiang et al. fabricated a monolithic column consisting carbon quantum dots-doped dummy MIP and used this column system for the extraction and preconcentration of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in peanut followed by its HPLC fluorescence determination. The synthesis procedure was based on the in situ polymerization reaction in the presence of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin as dummy template molecule. The in situ polymerization reaction was carried out in a water bath [98]. Good recovery results ranging from 79.5% to 91.2% with low intra- and interday RSDs (1.2% and 4.9%) were obtained for the extraction and analysis of AFB1 in peanut. LOD, limit of quantitation, and enhancement factor were found as 0.118, 0.393, and 71 ng mL21, respectively [98]."

      "heading" : "15.2.1.1.2 Noncovalent functionalization of carbon-based nanomaterials",
      "text" : "Although the functionalized adsorbents obtained by covalent modification of NPs with a complexing agent or organic group offer significant use advantages, the production of these materials is difficult. Hence, noncovalent modification of NPs with different functional groups, such as complexing agent-organic groups [TAR, poly (diallylmethylammoniumchloride) Aliquat 336, tartrazine, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid, tannic acid, tri-octyl phosphine oxide, 5-(4-dimethylamino-benzylidene)-rhodanine, etc.]; biomolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, enzymes, and DNA); polymers [polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole, poly(3,4-dioxythiophene), polydiphenylamine, polyethyleneimine, polyvinylalcohol, poly(2-aminothiophenol), etc.]; surfactants; ionic liquids (ILs) (butylmethylimidazoliumhexafluorophosphate [BMIm] [PF6], hexylmethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [HMIm][PF6], etc.); and biological materials (bacteria, like biochar), is a good choice [99 102]. The executive forces in noncovalent modification are the hydrophobic, van der Waals, and/or electrostatic interactions classified as physical adsorption. These physical modification methods generally are simpler, effective, cheap, and ecofriendly than covalent modification methods to obtain desired extraction sorbents.\nWhen reviewing literature studies, it is observed that impregnation functionalization of NMs with complexing agent-organic groups is used frequently in the extraction of heavy metals and radioactive species since especially impregnation of complexing agents or organic compounds on the surface of NMs provide high selectivity and high adsorption capacity toward metal and radioactive species due to functional groups having O, S, N, etc. atoms [99 102]. ALOthman et al. impregnated MWCNTs with TAR to obtain selective sorbent toward Ni(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) ions. In this modification procedure, 0.2 g of MWCNTs was added in 0.5% of TAR solution (25 mL), and the obtained mixture was stirred for 12 h. TAR-impregnated MWCNTs were filtered, washed, and dried prior to use. They filled the new sorbent in the glass column system for SPE of metal ions at trace level. The metal ions, which retained on the TARimpregnated MWCNTs at pH 7.0, were eluted with 3 mol L21 acetic acid and analyzed FAAS detection system. The developed SPE method was applied to analyze trace amounts of heavy metal ions in food samples [99].\nHabila et al. fabricated 1-nitroso-2-naphthol-impregnated MWCNTs as SPE sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of lead(II) and copper(II) ions prior to their FAAS determinations. The developed SPE method was applied to different food and water samples [100].\nGouda et al. used MWCNT impregnated with 2-(2-benzothiazolylazo)orcinol (BTAO) as SPE sorbent for the extraction and preconcentration of trace levels of Zn(II) Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), and Cd(II) ions. In general impregnation procedure, 200 mg of MWCNTs was mixed with 1.03 1023 mol L21 of BTAO solution for 12 h. The obtained sorbent was filled into 150 mm3 10 mm glass column for the extraction of heavy metal ions. The metal ions at trace levels were sorbed on the MWCNTs-BTAO material at pH 7.0 and eluted with 5.0 mL of 2.0 mol L21 HNO3. The preconcentration factor was found as 100. The LODs were found in range of 0.7 2.2 μg L21 [101]. Soylak and Topal used MWCNTs impregnated with tartrazine for SPE of trace amounts of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions, followed by their FAAS determination. The suggested SPE-FAAS procedure provided LODs of 6.6 and 0.8 mg L21, respectively, for Pb(II) and Cd(II) and preconcentration factor of 40 [102].\nNoncovalent modification of NMs with polymers consists of two steps: (1) physical mixing of NMs in solution and (2) in situ polymerization of monomers in the presence of NMs or surfactant-assisted formation of polymers on the surface of NMs [103 110]. Sahmetlioglu et al. modified MWCNTs with polypyrrole and used the obtained composite material for SPE of Pb(II) ions in water samples. In the synthesis procedure an acidic mixture consists of 0.25 g of MWCNTs and 250 μL of pyrrole monomer was stirred for 30 min at 0 C in ice bath. Then, stoichiometric amount of acidic ammonium persulfate solution was added into the mixture drop by drop and stirred for 5 h. At this stage, black polypyrrole particles were formed on the surface of MWCNTs. The obtained polypyrrole MWCNT composite was washed, dried, and filled into a glass column [103].\nChen et al. modified MWCNTs with branched cationic polyethyleneimine (BPEI) to obtain an inorganic organic hybrid material. They converted MWCNTs into MWCNTs-COOH by oxidizing them in a sulfuric acid/nitric acid mixture (3:1, v/v). Modification of MWCNTs-COOH with BPEI was based on the electrostatic attraction between the carboxyl groups on the oxidized MWCNT surface and the positively charged protonated amines in the polymer. The prepared material was filled in a minicolumn for online SPE of As(V) at trace level at pH 5.8. The column system was combined to hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The developed method was applied to water samples [104].\nNabid et al. used MWCNTs-poly(2-amino thiophenol) nanocomposites as sorbent for SPE of trace levels of Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions in some environmental samples. The N and S atoms in conducting polymer share electron pairs with metal ions, which lead to the adsorption of metal ions on the macromolecular chains. In the fabrication of poly(2-amino thiophenol) on the surface of MWCNTs, 0.5 g of MWCNTs and 1.15 mmol of 2-aminothiophenol were stirred at 5 C in ice bath. Then, stoichiometric amount of acidic ammonium persulfate solution was added into the mixture drop by drop and stirred for 5 h. At this stage, poly(2-amino thiophenol) was formed on the surface of MWCNTs. The obtained nanocomposites were washed and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 24 h [105]. Zhang et al. used in situ electrochemical polymerization method to fabricate a novel sulfonated graphene/polypyrrole (SG/PPy) SPME coating on a stainless steel wire. The optimum parameters for sorbent fabrication process were SG doping amount of 1.5 mg mL21 and polymerization time of 15 min. The SG/PPy coating used at least 200 replicate extractions with excellent mechanical durability and thermal stability. Moreover, the new material showed higher extraction capacity and selectivity to volatile terpenes than commonly used commercial materials. SG/PPy coating was practically used to analyze the volatile compounds from fennel and star anise samples [106]. Han et al. prepared an SPME-coating material by using polysilicon fullerene. The new material was used for the extraction and preconcentration of aromatic compounds at trace level. The obtained results showed that the new polysilicon fullerene was more selective, sensitive, and efficient than nonpolar PDMS commercial availably. Further, the lifetime, reproducibility, and thermal stability of polysilicon fullerene coat are better than the PDMS commercial availably [107].\nZhang et al. prepared poly(3-methylthiophene carbazole)/GO composite on a stainless steel wire by using electrochemical synthesis procedure. The new device was utilized as headspace SPME device for the separation and preconcentration of dodecanol, nonanal, undecanol, decanal, and octanal. After extraction stage, the concentration of analytes was measured by GC. The SPME fiber was denoted as P (3MeT-Cz)/GO fiber and it has a coating thickness of about 55 μm [108]. Another possible application of electrochemical deposition method was searched by Behzadi et al. They prepared poly(o-anisidine)/GO nanosheets on a steel wire as headspace SPME device. The new device was used for the separation and preconcentration of trace levels of xylenes, toluene, benzene, and ethylbenzene prior to their GC detections [109].\nKojidi et al. prepared poly(2,6-diaminopyridine)-modified GO composite materials by a simple in situ polymerization of 2,6-diaminopyridine monomer in a mixture of GO particles. In that synthesis method, 120 mg of GO was dispersed in a solution, including water and ethanol solution. Then, 1036 mg of 2,6-diaminopyridine was added into the mixture of GO and the polymerization started with the rapid addition of ammonium persulfate. The mixture was obtained at 0 C for 24 h. The obtained black precipitate was washed with different solutions, dried, and filled in a glass column for SPE of cadmium(II) traces. The new material was characterized by FT-IR, XRD, and SEM methods. The concentration of cadmium in last phases was measured by FAAS [110].\nThe introduction of new green extraction solvents, such as surfactants, ILs, deep eutectic solvents (DESs), switchable solvents, and bioderived solvents in the liquid phase based analytical sample preparation methods was remarkable. These solvents were used as effective and selective extraction ones in thousands of liquid phase based separation and preconcentration methods, such as liquid liquid extraction, single drop microextraction, dispersive liquid liquid microextraction, and solidified organic drop microextraction. Once the scientists realized that these solvents showed a high selectivity to different analytes, the idea of using these solvents in combination with solid-phase sorbents leads to new ideas and practices in the SPE/SPME fields [111 114]. For instance, the covalent or noncovalent modification of NMs with surfactants, ILs, DESs, and bioderived solvents leads to the enhancement of the extraction procedure and fulfills the principles of green analytical chemistry [112 115]. Perhaps the most important and desired benefits of their use as functionalizing agents in the modification of different nano-sized sorbents are low toxicity and biodegradability. Furthermore, they can be used as green extraction mediums for the separation and preconcentration of trace organic, inorganic, and bioactive species [111 119]. ILs are synthesized by combining asymmetric organic cations with different types of organic or inorganic anions. The common organic cations used are ammonium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, and imidazolium, whereas organic or inorganic anions are chloride, bromide, hexafluorophosphate, and tetrafluoroborate. As ILs provided low vapor pressure, wide viscosity range, and high thermal stability to users, those are preferred in sample preparation, chromatography, and electrochemistry applications instead of using toxic organic solvents. ILs show high affinity to some inorganic, organic, and bioactive species due to the presence of dipole dipole, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding along with the alkyl groups of cations in them. Hence, the modification of NMs with ILs provided high adsorption capacity, improved selectivity, and high interactive characteristics toward analytes. NMs modified with ILs can be used in different sorptive-based extraction procedures (e.g., SPE, μSPE, SPME, d-SPE, and DμSPE) [111 119]. Combination uses of ILs with solid-phase sorbents were reported for the first time in 2005. In this study, SPME fiber was coated with disposable ILs before taking the extraction step. 1-Octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C8MIM][PF6]) IL was used for the modification of PDMS. The prepared fiber\nwas used for an SPME of headspace of benzene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and toluene in paint samples [112].\nLi et al. prepared a headspace SPME device that consists of MWCNTs-COOH, IL (i.e., 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), PANI, and stainless steel wires. The synthesis procedure includes two steps: (1) formation of 3D porous materials (MWCNTs-rGO-IL) by one-step selfassembly process and (2) coelectrodeposition of MWCNTs-rGO-IL with PANI on stainless steel wires by cyclic voltammetry. The new material was characterized and used for the headspace SPME of octanol, nonanol, geraniol, decanol, undecanol, and dodecanol prior to performing GC analysis [113].\nZhang et al. prepared a 3D IL-ferrite functionalized GO nanocomposite (3D-ILFe3O4-GO) as a sorbent in pipette-tip SPE (PT-SPE) of 16 PAHs in human blood samples. Analyses were carried out by GC MS detections. When compared with conventional SPE applications, the PT-SPE method provided important applicable advantages, such as use of low volume of solvent (1.0 mL) and blood sample (0.2 mL) and usability for many times (at least 10 times). Analytes in the blood samples can be analyzed with the developed method between good recoveries (85.0% 115%). The LOQs were found in the range of 0.007 0.013 μg L21 [114]. In a different application, IL-functionalized graphene was fabricated for PT-SPE of auxins in soybean sprouts. In this procedure, thiolene click chemistry was used for the functional modification of pentafluorobenzyl imidazolium bromide IL with graphene. The modification of graphene with ILs leads to an aggregation prevention of graphene as well as improvements in the interaction between graphene and analytes by hydrogen bonding, π π interactions, electrostatic interactions, and ionic exchange [115].\nHamidi et al. synthesized an IL-functionalized magnetic GO/polypyrrole composite for mixed hemimicelles dispersive micro-SPE of methotrexate from urine samples prior to its spectrophotometric determination [116]. 1-Hexadecyl-3methylimidazolium bromide (C16mimBr) was used as IL. The authors modeled interactions between methotrexate and sorbent by molecular docking, and the interaction energy was found as 28.35 kcal mol21 [116]. Zhang et al. fabricated a new 3D IL-functionalized magnetic GO nanocomposite (3D-IL@mGO), characterized by SEM, vibrating sample magnetometer, and XPS methods and applied for the magnetic d-SPE (MSPE) of 16 PAHs in vegetable oil followed by the GC MS analysis [117]. The new material was synthesized in two steps: Step 1: the synthesis of IL@mGO was carried out by solvothermal reaction under N2 gas, 1.0 g NaOH, 2.5 g FeCl3 6H2O, and 7.5 g NaAc were mixed in 100 mL EG at 50 C until the transparent solution was obtained. Then 50 mg 1-(3- aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 50 mg of GO were combined and stirred vigorously at 80 C for 1 h prior to solvothermal reaction. The resulting IL@mGO was washed for several times and dried. Step 2: the synthesis of 3DIL@mGO was carried out by free-radical copolymerization; 100 mg of IL@mGO, 0.0143 mol of divinylbenzene, and 0.020 mol of maleic anhydride were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran under the inert gas. Then, 1.0 g of benzoyl peroxide was mixed with the obtained solution at 80 C and refluxed under inert atmosphere for 2 h.\nThe obtained 3D-IL@mGO material was washed, dried, and used in the MSPE application.\nWu et al. used IL-coated magnetic GO NPs as a mixed hemimicelles SPE material for cephalosporins in biological samples followed by HPLC analysis [118]. The synthesis procedure consisted of two main steps: the synthesis of GO from graphite by the modified Hummers method and the synthesis of magnetic GO NPs (Fe3O4/ GO NPs) by solvothermal reaction.\nIn general, DESs are prepared by mixing two or more components to obtain a new liquid, which has a lower melting point than each individual component. The main driving force in the formation of these solvents is the hydrogen bond between the constituent components. DESs were discovered by Abbot et al. in 2003 when they searched the solvent features of the eutectic mixtures of different types of ammonium salts and urea [119,120].\nAlthough many DES can be produced by self-association of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and acceptors, the most preferred DESs are prepared by the combination of choline chloride (ChCl) with carboxylic acids (e.g., citric, succinic, and oxalic acids), urea, and glycerol as HBDs. Furthermore, DESs can be prepared by natural, available, and cheap components, such as alcohols, sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. These DESs are called natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs). In general, DESs and NADESs have been used as extraction solvents in the liquid phase based extraction methods due to their green properties, adjustable viscosity, and high selectivity characteristics toward analytes. At the same time, the preparation and use of SPE systems in desired properties as a result of modification of different sorbents with DESs and NADESs have attracted considerable attention of scientists [119 122]. Liu et al. modified graphene with a DES, which was prepared from choline chloride and ethylene glycol. In the modification procedure, 200 mg of GO was added in the solution, including 200 mL of water, 140 mg of ChCl, and 120 mg of EG, and the obtained mixture was stirred and refluxed at 80 C for 12 h. In the last step, 2 g of hydrazine hydrate was added, and this mixture was stirred at 80 for 24 h. The new sorbent was used for the PT-SPE of sulfamerazine traces prior to performing HPLC analysis. Sulfamerazine in water samples was extracted and analyzed with low LOD (10 mg L21) and high extraction efficiencies (91.01% 96.82%) [120].\nDifferent applications of DES with sorbents were reported by Wang et al. in 2016. They fabricated GO-DES@silica by using DESs and GO-IL@silica by using ILs. In the synthesis procedure, GO was modified by DESs or ILs to obtain GODES and GO-IL, and then the prepared materials were connected to surface of silica by a covalent bonding between COOH groups of GO and amino group of silica. Subsequent reactions of these materials with hydrazine solution lead to the formation of G-DES@silica and G-IL@silica materials. The obtained final products (GDES@silica and G-IL@silica) were used for the separation and preconcentration of CPs in water samples prior to HPLC-UV determinations. The results showed that GDES1@silica (ChCl:formic acid, 1:2), GO-DES4@silica (ChCl:urea, 1:2),\nG-IL3@silica ([HMIM][Tf2N]), and GO-IL4@silica ([EMIM][Br]) have a better extraction performance than that of other sorbents for the extraction of CPs [121].\nYousefi et al. produced DES magnetic bucky gels by modifying magnetic MWCNTs with DES (choline chloride/urea). Modification of magnetic MWCNTs with DES was based on the noncovalent interactions. The new DES magnetic bucky gels were used as sorbents in d-SPE of OCPs in water samples with EFs between 270 and 340 [122].\nFunctionalization of NMs with living or died bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Geobacillus toebii, Geobacillus thermoleovorans, Bacillus sp., Pleurotus eryngii, and Bacillus altitudinis, plays an important role in the sample preparation methods. These sorption-based methods are called “biosorption” in the literature [123 125]. Aydemir et al. modified MWCNTs with died E. coli bacteria to prepare a biosorbent for the SPE cobalt, copper, nickel, and cadmium at trace level followed by FAAS analysis. In order to immobilize nonliving E. coli on the MWCNTs, the same amount of nonliving E. coli and MWCNTs was mixed together in water at 200 rpm for 2 h. After immobilization, E. coli MWCNTs was separated from aqueous phase, dried, stabilized in a vacuum oven at about 80 C 105 C for 24 h and ground. The new sorbent has high adsorption affinity metal ions at a pH value of 7. The retained ions on the E. coli MWCNTs were eluted by using 0.5 M nitric acid [123].\nTuzen et al. prepared P. aeruginosa immobilized MWCNTs as biosorbent for the separation and preconcentration of nickel(II), cadmium(II), lead(II), chromium (III), manganese(II), and cobalt(II) ions at trace levels. They used mixing technique, on the basis of the physical immobilization, to obtain biosorbent [124].\nOzdemir et al. prepared B. altitudinis immobilized ND as SPE sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of Pb21, Co21, Cr61, and Hg21 ions. In the preparation method of B. altitudinis immobilized ND, 3 mL distilled water and 300 mg of dried and autoclaved B. altitudinis were shaken in a 250 mL glass bottle for 8 h, then, 300 mg of ND was added into the bacteria mixture and thoroughly mixed. The obtained biosorbent was filled into a column for SPE applications. After extraction, concentrations of analytes in eluent were measured by ICP-OES [125]."

      "text" : "Metallic and metal-oxide NPs belong to inorganic-based NM class formed by combining one, two, or three metals and/or their oxides. Metal and metal-oxide NPs are frequently used in sample preparation methods, chromatographic separation methods, spectroscopic analysis techniques, and sensor technologies due to their availability by simple and cheap preparations, their easy modification abilities with organic and inorganic-based materials, their effective mechanical, chemical, electrical, and catalytic properties, having a large surface area and high adsorption capacities. As the most used metallic NPs in analytical applications are Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ni, Fe, Co, and Mn, the usually preferred metallic NPs are Fe3O4, Al2O3, TiO2, MnO, ZrO2, CeO2, and ZnO [126 130].\nThe first stage of immobilization of preproduced metal NPs (MNPs) and metaloxide NPs is the chemical modification of the substrate surfaces. The second stage is the immobilization of preproduced MNPs and metal-oxide NPs by electrostatic interactions or weaker physical interactions with unmodified surfaces. Many methods have been introduced to directly fabricate MNPs and metal-oxide NPs on surfaces in one step [e.g., hydrothermal growth, potentiostatic anodization, electroless and electrochemical deposition, liquid-phase deposition (LPD), and in situ chemical oxidation] [131 134]."

      "text" : "Immobilization of MNPs and metal-oxide NPs on a substrate is started with the chemical modification of the substrate by three different processes: (1) silanization, (2) sol gel, and (3) usage of bifunctional compounds. 15.2.2.1.1.1 Silanization The modification of surfaces of materials with thiolterminated and amine-terminated silane groups is one of the most used procedures for immobilizing MNPs and metal-oxide NPs. In the silanization reactions, a surface is covered by silanol groups and then hydrolysis of alkoxy groups with the liberation of silanol groups and the release of alcohols, and producing siloxane linkages on the surface by the release of water molecules, which leads to the formation of covalent bonds between the surface and silanol groups [126].\nSilane groups, such as 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane APTES, (3-chloropropyl)-trimethoxysilane, TMSPDETA, and TMSPEDA, are frequently used as coupling agents for covalent modification of NMs. Required MNPs and metaloxide NPs are covalently attached to NMs via these silane groups.\n15.2.2.1.1.2 Sol gel method The sol gel method is considered effective to modify the surface of substrates. Obtaining of a high surface area and stable surfaces is the most important advantage of the sol gel method. The chemical and physical properties of the materials obtained by the sol gel method are related to the experimental conditions applied. The sol gel method involves two main reactions: (1) hydrolysis of the precursor in the acidic or basic mediums and (2) polycondensation of the hydrolyzed products. In this way a polymeric network is formed in which MNPs can be retained [126].\n15.2.2.1.1.3 Bifunctional compounds Bifunctional compounds are molecular linker agents and frequently used for the immobilization of MNPs on a surface. The natures of both the MNP and the solid substrate are important to accomplish effective chemical modification by using bifunctional compounds. For example, MNPs can be immobilized on a surface, and thiol functionalization with alkanedithiols is applied to immobilize MNPs on inorganic and organic substrates [135]."

      "text" : "Immobilization of MNPs with electrostatic interactions is based on the attractive electrostatic interactions of charged surfaces with opposite-charged MNPs, and these methods play an important role in the analytical applications [127 130]. As an example application, polymeric monoliths functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups are the good substrates for the attachment of the citrate-capped iron-oxide NPs [127]. In these methods, high molecular weight polycations and polyanions are used as electrostatic interaction agents between surface and MNPs. This immobilization method is generally called “layer-by-layer deposition,” while poly(allylamine hydrochloride), as polycation, is commonly used for the immobilization of negative-charged MNPs, such as citrate-capped gold nanospheres [128], citrate-stabilized AgNPs [129], and poly(styrene sulfonate) as polyanion is usually used for immobilization of positive-charged MNPs, such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide-capped gold nanorods [130].\nWeaker physical interactions, such as van der Waals forces, can become executive force to immobilize MNPs and metal-oxide NPs on different substrates utilized for analytical applications. For example, metal-oxide NPs can be immobilized on the carbon-based electrodes by immersing the substrate in the colloidal solution of MNPs for a certain time [131]. Although physical interaction-based immobilization methods are frequently used, the stability and the durability of the obtained materials are important because of the weak interactions between MNPs and metal-oxide NPs and the solid substrate."

Both electrochemical deposition and electroless methods are binder-free immobilization techniques, because any linker agent is not used. The desired chemical composition, the size, and the composition of MNPs can be provided by changing experimental conditions [139 141]."

      "text" : "Potentiostatic anodization is another method to fabricate metal-oxide NPs on solid substrates. In this system, metallic substrates behave as electrode for the growth of metal-oxide NPs on them. In this system an anodic voltage was applied to the metals in the fluoride-containing nonaqueous electrolyte medium to obtain metaloxide NPs or surface-oxide films. An example of synthesis is explained on the formation of TiO2 nanotubes on a Ti substrate [126]. The obtaining of pores on the metallic surface is the first stage of synthesis, which is performed for the formation of a water-soluble hexafluorotitanate(IV) complex [TiF6] 22. In the second stage, [TiF6] 22 is converted to Ti(OH)4 by instantaneous hydrolysis reaction in the pores of metals. In the final step, electrochemical anodization is applied for the formation of metal-oxide NPs at the surface of the metallic substrate. These methods can also be applicable for the fabrication of different valve metals, such as zirconium, tantalum, hafnium, niobium, and tungsten [126].\nFor analytical applications, including detection and sample preparation, MNPs and metal-oxide NPs can be modified with different materials, such as carbonbased NMs (SWCNTs, DWCNTs, MWCNTs, fullerenes, nanodimonds, graphene, GO, and C-nanofiber), polymers, silicon-based substrates, and metallic surfaces.\nA considerable number of metal, metal-oxide NPs, and their functionalized forms are frequently preferred for sample preparation methods, such as SPE, SPME, and liquid-phase microextraction due to their simple functionalization capabilities with different materials (polymers, carbon-based NMs, nanofibers, and so on), high surface areas, high adsorption capacities, and high chemical and mechanical stability [142 146]. Jiang et al. synthesized gold NP-modified reduced GO as a sorbent for SPE of ochratoxin A, AFB1, aflatoxin M1, zearalanone, zearalenone, α-zearalanol, β-zearalanol, α-zearalenol, and β-zearalenol in a milk sample prior to their ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) MS/MS analysis. Au NPs were obtained by a chemical reduction of Au31 ions in the presence of ascorbic\nacid and sodium citrate. The developed SPE-UHPLC MS/MS procedure allows the LOQ between 0.02 and 0.18 ng mL21, acceptable recoveries between 70.2 and 111.2 with RSD, in the range of 2.0% 14.9% [142]. Trujillo-Rodrı́guez and Anderson modified SPME fibers with silver-based polymeric IL sorbents to obtain a new SPME device. In the first step of synthesis procedure, IL monomers were formed by cations, including the Ag1 coordinated with two 1-vinylimidazole ligands. In the second step, polymeric IL sorbents were obtained on the commercial fibers by free-radical polymerization in the presence of either silver bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide and/or a dicationic IL cross-linker. They prepared seven different types of SPME devices by using different combinations of ILs, cross-linkers, and their different mole ratios. The new SPME devices were used to separate and preconcentrate unsaturated compounds prior to performing the GC FID analysis [143]. Yazdi et al. fabricated polypyrrole-silver nanocomposite for the separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of parabens in water and beverage samples by hollow fiber SPME. After performing the extraction step, analyses were carried out by HPLC-UV. First, polypropylene hollow fibers were modified with polypyrrole by a polymerization reaction in the presence of FeCl3. The prepared polypyrrolemodified hollow fibers were immersed in a solution of AgNPs, which was prepared by the modified Tollens procedure. LOD, LOQ, and linear range values for analytes were 0.01, 0.05, and 0.05 200 μg L21, respectively [144]. Yang et al. coated SPME fibers with nanoscale graphitic carbon nitride/copper oxide hybrid material (nano-g-C3N4/CuO) for the separation and preconcentration of pyrene, naphthalene, acenaphthene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and fluorene PAHs, followed by their GC analysis. The prepared new SPME device provided a better adsorption performance than each of the pristine nanoscale graphitic carbon nitride (nano-g-C3N4) or copper oxide (CuO). LODs lying in the range of 0.025 0.40 ng mL21, RSDs from 2.5% to 7.3%, lying in the linear range from 0.1 to 1000 ng mL21, were obtained with this new extraction system [145].\nGhani et al. constructed highly porous copper foam fibers on the surface of an unbreakable copper wire to obtain a new sorbent for the extraction and preconcentration of trace levels of xylene, toluene, benzene, and ethylbenzene in waters prior to their GC FID analysis. A simple and rapid electrochemical method was used to fabricate the highly porous copper foam on the surface of copper wire. Under optimum conditions, LODs in the range of 0.12 0.41 μg L21, RSDs from 6.9% to 9.6%, in the linear range from 1 to 500 μg L21, and recoveries more than 88% were obtained by using this new extraction and analysis combination [146].\nYazdi et al. used MWCNT-zirconium oxide nanocomposite materials (MWCNTs-ZrO2) as coating materials for hollow fiber SPME of polyaromatic hydrocarbons before HPLC-UV determinations. Modification of polypropylene hollow fibers included the following steps: (1) conversion of Zr(OH)4 to ZrO2 NPs on the MWCNTs via a heating process to obtain MWCNTs-ZrO2 nanocomposite and (2) modification of polypropylene hollow fibers with the as-prepared MWCNTsZrO2 nanocomposite by sonication method [147]."

      "text" : "In the last two decades, magnetic SPE methods using magnetic adsorbents have become one of the most commonly used methods for the separation and enrichment of organic, inorganic, and bioactive species at the matrix level. In 1973 Robinson et al. suggested the first magnetic separation [148]. But Šafařı́ková and Šafařı́k used magnetic SPE term as an analytical application in 1999 [149]. They prepared a magnetic charcoal sorbent for magnetic SPE of safranin O and crystal violet in water samples [149]. About 460-fold preconcentration factor was obtained for analytes.\nThe MSPE method is based on the adsorption and desorption of analytes on magnetic adsorbents that are added to the sample solution containing the analytes. In this method, different types of polymers, NMs, metals, and metal oxides that can be used as adsorbents are modified by magnetic particles, such as nano-sized Fe3O4, γ-Fe2O3, ZnFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4. In this way, adsorbents that do not show magnetic properties are given magnetic properties [150,151].\nMagnetic NPs, such as Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3, have low stability in a solution medium, especially under acidic conditions, which cause the decomposition of materials in a short time and loss of their magnetic properties. To prevent this drawback, the materials obtained are modified by silica, alumina oxides, or different groups that are resistant to harsh working conditions [29,152].\nThe selection of the suitable sorbent-used MSPE is the most important step to be taken in this method, which affects the extraction efficiency as in other methods. Some of the most used new-generation SPME sorbents in MSPE applications are as follows [153 159]: 1. carbon NPs (CNTs, fullerenes, ND, graphene, GO, carbon dots, and modified carbon\nNPs);\n2. metal oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, etc.); 3. polymers (cyclodextrine, polypyrrole, polyaniline, gelatin, chitosan, polydivinylbenzene-\nco-methacrylic acid, etc.);\n4. metal organic frameworks; 5. MIPs; 6. mesoporous and nanoporous silicates; and 7. graphene-like materials (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, C3N4, etc.).\nThe SPME is used to separate and preconcentrate a wide range of trace analytes in different matrix mediums, including the following [159 163]: 1. food, drug, and biological sample analysis; extraction and preconcentration of metals,\ndyes, pesticides, pharmaceutical active ingredients, etc.;\n2. biomedicine; isolation, extraction, and preconcentration of different bioactive species,\nsuch as DNA, RNA, enzymes, proteins, peptides, and cells;\n3. environmental analysis; extraction and preconcentration of metals, dyes, pesticides, phar-\nmaceutical active ingredients, surfactants, PAHs, mutagenic, and carcinogenic analytes in water and sewage samples; and 4. earth and mineral science; extraction and preconcentration of valuable metals and radioac-\ntive species.\nSome MSPE applications in the literature for the separation and preconcentration\nof trace organic and inorganic analytes are summarized in the following.\nIn 2002 Šafařı́ková and Šafařı́k tested the applicability of magnetic SPE procedure for high volumes of urine samples. For this purpose, they fabricated a reactive copper phthalocyanine dye immobilized magnetite particles for the separation and preconcentration of crystal violet dye as a model analyte in high volumes of urine samples as crystal violet leads to an increased risk of cancer for living cells [164]. In 2005 the same research group used the MSPE method to separate and preconcentrate nonionic surfactants based on aliphatic alcohols, hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters, and oxyethylated nonylphenol in water samples [165].\nHuang and Hu fabricated, characterized, and used γ-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane-modified silica-coated magnetic NPs (SCMNPs) as an innovative SPME sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of Pb, Hg, Cu, and Cd at trace levels in environmental and biological samples. In this method, 50 mg of magnetic sorbent was added in the sample solution, including metal ions (pH 6.0), and the obtained mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min to ensure the adsorption of analytes on the magnetic sorbent. Then the sorbent was isolated from the sample solution phase by applying external magnetic field, and analytes on the sorbent were eluted with 1.0 mol L21 HCl and 2% (m/v) thiourea elution solution by using ultrasonication power. Analyte concentrations in the eluent phase were measured by ICP-MS. The LODs for analytes were between 24 and 56 pg L21 [166].\nSuleiman et al. used bismuthiol-II-immobilized SCMNPs for the separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of Pb, Cu, and Cr in lake and river water samples. Analytes in the aqueous phase were extracted to 100 mg of magnetic nanosorbent phase at pH 7.0 by using an ultrasonic irritation source. A 1.0 mol L21 HNO3 solution was used to desorb analytes from the sorbent. Concentrations of analytes were measured by ICP-OES [167]. An important application of the magnetic sorbents (as on-chip online SPE) was reported by Li et al. in 2009. The authors fabricated a PDMS/glass hybrid microchip for online SPE and electrophoresis separation of the trace amount of fluorescence isothiocyanate-labeled phenylalanine. The extraction phase was prepared by the modification of the magnetic microspheres with hydroxyl-terminated PDMS (PDMS-OH). The extraction phase conveniently immobilized into the SPE channel by magnetic field. In this system, injection of the sample solution into the SPE channel (PDMS-OH microspheres bed) and desorption of analyte from the sorbent phase into the electrophoresis channel were electrically driven [168]. Cheng et al. used 1-hexadecyl-3methylimidazolium bromide (C16mimBr)-coated Fe3O4 magnetic NPs as an magnetic adsorbent for the mixed hemimicelles SPE of trace amounts of 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol compounds in environmental waters followed by HPLC-UV analysis. The new nano-sized sorbent provided a high surface area that leads to high adsorption capacity and high extraction efficiencies (74% 90%) at a minimum level of sorbent (40 mg) [169]. Jiang et al. used zincon-immobilized silica-coated magnetic Fe3O4 NPs for the magnetic SPE of trace amounts of lead in water samples prior to the determination by using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. The detection limit\n(LOD), EF, and recovery results of the proposed method were found as 10 ng L21, 200, and 84% 104%, respectively [170]. Cui et al. prepared chitosan-modified magnetic NPs by an emulsion method for the magnetic separation and preconcentration of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in lake and tap water samples prior to ICP-OES detection. The LOD, PF, and RSD% for Cr(III) and Cr(total) were found as 100, 0.02, and 0.03 ng mL21 and 4.8% and 5.6%, respectively [171].\nWang et al. used a hydrothermal reaction procedure to synthesize a Fe3O4-functionalized metal organic framework (m-MOF) composite as an MSPE sorbent. They synthesized the metal organic framework from Zn(II) and 2- aminoterephthalic acid. X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, TGA, SEM, and magnetization methods were used for the characterization of m-MOF composites. The new magnetic sorbent was used for the separation and preconcentration of trace amounts of copper followed by ETAAS detection [172]. Azodi-Deilami used magnetic MIP (m-MIP) NPs as a magnetic SPE sorbent for tracing the amount of paracetamol in human blood plasma samples. In the synthesis of the m-MIPs, magnetite (Fe3O4) as the magnetic component, 2-(methacrylamido) ethyl methacrylate as a cross-linker, and MAA as a functional monomer were used. The m-MIPs synthesized were characterized by TEM, FT-IR, XRD, and vibrating sample magnetometry methods. Analysis of paracetamol in the last phase was measured by HPLC. The LOD, LOQ, PF, and RSD% recoveries for paracetamol were 0.17 μg L21, 0.4 μg L21, 40, and 4.5%, respectively [173]."

The combination of dimensions, unique structures, and surface morphologies make NPs effective and interesting materials for sample preparation methods. Moreover, the functionalization capability of NMs by different agents and methods is one of the most important properties, which are used as per their desired capabilities, such as selectivity toward analyte or analytes, high adsorption capacity, solubility, physical, and chemical resistivity.
