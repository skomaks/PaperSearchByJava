For example, targeted drug delivery systems can improve intracellular delivery because of their multifunctionality. Novel endogenous-based and exogenous-based stimulusresponsive drug delivery systems have been proposed to prevent the cancer progression with proper drug delivery. To control effective dose loading and sustained release, targeted permeability and individual variability can now be described in more-complex ways, such as by combining internal and external stimuli. Despite these advances in release control, certain challenges remain and are identified in this research, which emphasizes the control of drug release and applications of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Using a multiscale and multidisciplinary approach, this study investigates and analyzes drug delivery and release strategies in the nanoparticle-based treatment of cancer, both mathematically and clinically."

      "text" : "Conventional approaches to cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and radiation, can kill cancer cells but are associated with collateral damages to healthy tissue and also variable treatment efficacy from patient to patient. Meanwhile, a newer approach, nanomedicine, is moving toward personalized medicine using advanced methods and integrating genomic and proteomic innovations to improve cancer treatment [1,2]. The use of nanoparticles, also called magic bullets, provides a context for an in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of disease at the molecular level of therapy. Nanoparticles now play a significant role in connecting a wide range of different sciences such as engineering, biology, physics and chemistry, as well as influencing\nrecent developments in the pharmaceutical industry, whether imaging agents or drug delivery systems (DDSs) [3,4]. Targeted approaches to delivering therapeutic drugs in cancer typically involve systemic therapy packaged in nanocarriers, or localized delivery of therapeutic drugs to the patient's tissue. The advantages of encapsulating anticancer drugs may include, for example, that it alters their bio-distribution, solubility, and bioavailability, as well as facilitates access to cancer cells [5]. The similarity between the size of the nanoparticles and those of cells, bacteria, and other biological entities leads to intimate and efficient interaction [6]. This interaction can be used to achieve important capabilities, including the controlled transport of drugs and their bonding to a patient's cells and tissues [7], plus the determination of disease-agent concentrations in complex\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.08.012 Received 4 June 2020; Received in revised form 7 August 2020; Accepted 8 August 2020\nAbbreviations: ATP, Adenosine-triphosphate; AMF, Alternating magnetic field; ACE, Angiotensin-converting enzyme; DDSs, Drug delivery systems; Dtxl, Docetaxel; EPR, Enhanced permeation and retention; EVA, Ethylene-vinyl acetate; ECM, Extracellular matrix; FRET, Forster resonance energy transfer; GSH, Glutathione; GAG, glycosaminoglycans; HNC, Heated nanocarrier; HIFU, High-intensity focused ultrasound; IL-1β, Interleukin-1β; LDHA, Lactate dehydrogenase A; LCST, Lower critical solution temperature; MMP, Matrix metalloproteinase; MNPs, Magnetic nanoparticles; MEC, Minimum effective concentration; MTC, Minimum toxicity concentration; MCT4, Monocarboxylate transporter 4; MPS, Mononuclear phagocyte system; MDR, Multiple-drug resistance; NI, Nitroreductase; PD, Pharmacodynamic; PK, Pharmacokinetic; pHLIP, pH low insertion peptide; SMANCS, Poly(stylene-co-maleic acid)-conjugated neoCarzinoStatin; RBC, Red blood cell; TSLs, Temperaturesensitive liposomes; Tf, Transferrin; Tf-R, Transferrin-Receptor; TNF, Tumor necrosis factor; TPA, Two-photon absorption; UCST, Upper critical solution temperature; MD, Molecular Dynamics; DPD, Dissipative Particle Dynamics\n⁎ Corresponding author at: University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L3G1.

Encapsulation of a drug increases the efficacy of various pharmaceutical compounds and also reduces its lateral effects. Furthermore, after injection, nano-based drug formulations can continue to circulate for a longer time by staying hidden from the body's defenses such as the mononuclear phagocytic system, thus increasing therapeutic effects [9]. A failed therapeutic response may be due to a variety of factors, including low nanoparticle stability, poor pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, drug solubility and bioavailability, toxicity and chemical resistance [10,11]. Nevertheless, nanoparticles-based DDSs have been welcomed by medical researchers as a way to overcome the numerous potential obstacles−anatomical, physiological, chemical, and clinical−related to intravenous administration [10].\nIn 1986, two Japanese researchers proposed the idea of using nanoparticles as drug carriers in oncology, thus taking advantage of nanoparticles tendency to passively accumulate in tumor tissue [12]. One of the keys to treating tumors with the help of nanocarriers is this passive accumulation, also known as passive or primary targeting, using the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect [13]. In addition, to enhance cellular uptake, the external surface of the nanocarriers can be decorated with bio-organic moieties that specifically bind to cellsurface receptors. Since this strategy is based on receptor-ligand mediated endocytosis, it is known as cellular or secondary targeting, or active targeting. The use of this strategy will significantly reduce drug side effects and decrease cell resistance to drugs, simultaneously [14]. To use this increased affinity and avidity, nanoparticles must first reach their target, so passive targeting is a prerequisite for active targeting [15]. The purpose of targeted DDSs is to achieve a high local concentration of drug in cancer tissue but low systemic exposure. However, translation of the ligand recognition and EPR effect into clinic practice still presents serious challenges, perhaps due to the stochastic nature of ligand-receptor interactions or to difficulties in controlling drug release from nanocarriers. In fact, drug-release control by Fickian diffusion is not particular to organs, tissues or cells, so efficacious delivery strategies are required [16]. Pharmaceutical profiles of commercial nanoparticles are predetermined, bringing with them major disadvantages such as lack of dose control tailored to individual patients' needs. Spatial and temporal control of drug release improves drug performance, thus minimizing toxicity by allowing the dose administered to be reduced [17]. Stimulant-responsive nanoparticles that dynamically detect tumor microenvironments respond dynamically to these considerations. In fact, stimuli-responsive DDSs are capable of overcoming many problems, including premature drug release [18]. Therefore, the current situation has led to a research trend investigating stimulus-responsive DDSs to control drug release, and multi-stimulus-responsive systems have been welcomed to increase treatment efficacy [19,20].\nWeaknesses in clinical trial results have not precisely highlighted the efficacy of nanoparticles and the benefits of treatment. This failure may be due to the unclear mechanism of interactions between the targeted cancer cells and targeting nanoparticles, as it influences the selection and design of the nanoparticles and ultimately leads to limited application and efficacy of functional nanoparticles [21]. Overcoming these problems requires in-depth and comprehensive investigations of drug release. However, it is very difficult to study each step of nano-bio interactions with conventional and laboratory methods, because many parameters and variables need to be considered over a wide period of time. Fortunately, mathematical and computational models are able to consider a large number of parameters at the same time and compare differences in simulation results [22]. In fact, mathematical simulations are able to describe the microenvironmental impact of tumors on nanoparticle transport and its complexity. Mathematical models recently proposed by researchers and engineers can be used to improve the speed of tumor discovery, as well as to reduce the outlay of laboratory resources and funds [23,24].\nThrough mathematical and clinical investigation, this study aims to deepen understanding of DDSs and to enhance dissemination\nperformance with the prerequisites and properties of nanocarriers and the Tumor microenvironments for static (passive and active) and dynamic (stimuli-responsive) targeting. It also explores the available modes of release into tumor tissue. Finally, it discusses research gaps for future research investigation, as well as approaches to translating promising strategies into clinical methods of targeted delivery, before briefly speculating on the future of the nanomedicine market."

      "text" : "The common method of drug injection involves the intravenous infusion of nanoparticles in which the nanoparticles interact with the endothelium in blood vessels and thus selectively enter the tumor interstitium. The nanoparticles must be uptake by the target cancer cells and held for long enough to perform their therapeutic function [25]. DDSs are designed to minimize limitations imposed by the biological complexity of carrier transport to target sites. Their functioning mainly relies on two important strategies. The first one, static targeted strategy, involves passive and active targeting. The key to passive targeting is the EPR effect, which is the basis of all DDSs. In active targeting, the surfaces of nanocarriers are modified by targeting ligands that attach to cancer cell receptors for internalization. The second one, dynamic strategy, is a good alternative to active targeting and uses both internal and external stimuli to release drugs from carriers. Hence, a carrier's conductance and release profile are very flexible (Fig. 1) [26]. For a successful DDS, not only must the above strategies be used optimally, but the method and profile of drug release must be carefully selected. Various mechanisms for drug release exist, each depending on a specific purpose. The main mechanisms of release and their application to DDSs are discussed below.\nExisting mathematical models of drug release and delivery are generally divided into compartmental and physiological models [27]. Compartmental models divide the human body into one or more connected compartments, each of them represents multiple organs with uniform drug concentrations. 1-compartment models consider the human body as an integrated compartment; while in 2-compartment models, there exist a central compartment and a peripheral compartment, and consequently, 3-compartment models have a central compartment, and two compartments for poorly perfused and highly perfused tissues [28,29]. On the other hand, physiological models, which are based on anatomical representation, consider organs as individual entities. Physiological models are very slow to measure and estimate due to including a large number of parameters, although it is more accurate than the compartmental models. They have limitations in different applications, but the number of parameters can be reduced by considering the compartment in combination with physiological models [30,31].\nIn the context of drug release, Fickian diffusion models assuming perfect sink conditions outside the carrier have been very successful [32,33]. Modeling studies on controlled drug release through responsive nanocarriers are rare and a developed theoretical model is not available. However, these models are mainly considered for three different models [34]:\ni) Drug release from the carrier into the perfect sink; ii) Drug release from the carrier, followed by absorption into the\nplasma and tissue, and then by metabolism and clearance; iii) Drug release from the carrier to tumor followed by absorption into\nthe plasma and tissue, and subsequent metabolism and clearance.\nRegardless of the level of difficulty in each of these models, they have different applications. Model (i) does not take into account key parameters such as the size and shape of the release medium, so it can be useful to explain in vitro drug release data. Models (i) and (ii) can be solved analytically, and to solve model (iii) numerically, a finite-\nTa bl\ne 1\nM at\nhe m\nat ic\nal m\nod el\ns go\nve rn\nin g\ndr ug\nr el\nea se\nfr om\nn an\noc ar\nri er\ns.\nEq . n\no.\nM at\nhe m\nat ic\nal m\nod el\nEq\nua tio\nn D\nes cr\nip tio\nn N\not e\nRe f.\n1 D\niff us\nio n\nm od\nel\n= J D A\ndC A dx J A\n: d ru\ng flu\nx,\nD : t\nhe c\noe ffi\nci en\nt o f d\nru g\ndi ffu\nsi on , C A : d ru g co nc en tr at io n.\nD iff\nus io\nn is\na p\nro ce\nss th\nat m\nol ec\nul es\nb y\nth e\nki ne\ntic e\nne rg\ny of\nr an\ndo m\nm ot\nio n\nar e\nin te\nrm in\ngl ed , w hi ch c an b e w el l e xp la in ed b y Fi ck 's la w s of d iff us io n [3\n5, 36\n]\n2 =\nD dC A dt d\nC A dx2 2\n3 Pe\npp as\nm od\nel\n= Kt\nM t M M\nt M\n: a fr\nac tio\nn of\nd ru\ng re\nle as\ned ,\nK: t\nhe r\nel ea\nse r\nat e\nco ns\nta nt , η: th e re le as e in de x.\nM at\nhe m\nat ic\nal m\nod el\nd ru\ng re\nle as\ne in\nte rm\ns of\nth e\npe rc\nen ta\nge o\nf t he\nlo g\ncu m\nul at\niv e\ndr ug\ns in\nce\nlo gg\nin g\nin is\nd efi\nne d\nas c\nal le\nd th\ne Ko\nrs m\ney er\n-P ep\npa s\nm od\nel .\nη de\nte rm\nin es\nt he\nd ru\ng re\nle as\ne m\nec ha\nni sm\n, t ha\nt 0.\n45 <\nη <\n0 .8\n9 co\nrr es\npo nd\ns to\nn on\n-F ic\nki an\ntr\nan sp\nor t,\nan d\n0. 45\n≤ η\nt o\nth e\nFi ck\nia n\ndi ffu\nsi on\nm od\nel .\n[3 7]\n4 H\nig uc\nhi m\nod el\n= = f\nQ D\nC C\nC t (2 )\nt t\nS S\nQ t:\nth e\nam ou\nnt o\nf d ru\ng re\nle as\ned p\ner u\nni t a\nre a\nat ti\nm e t, D: t he d iff us io n co ns ta nt , C: t he in iti al c on ce nt ra tio n of th e dr ug , C S : t he s ol ub ili ty o f t he d ru g.\nId en\ntif yi\nng h\now li\npi d-\nso lu\nbl e\nan d\nw at\ner -s\nol ub\nle d\nru gs\na re\nr el\nea se\nd fr\nom d\niff er\nen t m\nat ri\nx sy\nst em\ns,\nTh is\nm od\nel c\nan b\ne si\nm pl\nifi ed\na s\n= f\nK t\nt H\n, i n\nw hi\nch K\nH is\nth e\nH ig\nuc hi\nd is\nso lu\ntio n\nco ns\nta nt .

In numerical studies, to extract the results, it is necessary to define the biological conditions as input data. Advanced mathematical models for estimating drug release are presented in Table 1.\nIn order to predict the release kinetics of the stimulus-responsive carrier, it is necessary that the phenomena governing release mechanisms such as swelling, dissolution, diffusion, and erosion to be understood. Grassi et al. [45], for example, solved the mass equilibrium equations for the solvent while including the contributions of both Fickian and non-Fickian conditions in the total flux calculations, which capture swelling phenomena. This modeling was performed in combination with the diffusion equation to predict the drug release kinetics at different temperatures and moving geometries. The nominal erosion hypothesis has also been well developed by incorporating Maxwell's law and a constant erosion rate of multi-component diffusion to propagate several components. Also, the use of flux balances of components namely, polymer, water, and drug in the front of swelling predicts the velocity of swelling appropriately [46,47]."

      "heading" : "3. Main mechanisms for controlling drug release",
      "text" : "A range of techniques are available for the controlled delivery of therapeutic agents to human or animal organisms, according to biological, physico-chemical, and mathematical principles. They result in enhanced product safety, improved patient convenience, and greater treatment efficacy. In fact, maintaining drug concentration in the blood between the minimum effective concentration (MEC) and the minimum toxicity concentration (MTC) from a therapeutic perspective is one of the most important purposes of controlling drug release [48]. With the injection of a single large dose of a drug, the plasma concentration of the drug first rises above the MTC and results in side effects, then drops rapidly below the MEC. Drug level fluctuations in plasma can be prevented by multiple drug doses being given within a short time, but this approach can lead to patient non-compliance. Therefore, nanocarriers capable of sustained or controlled drug release with a low dosing frequency must be developed. For this goal, the drug release profile is assumed to be zero-order (Fig. 2I) [49,50]. Poor performance of drug release mechanisms is one of the main reasons of reducing the therapeutic efficacy of a system. Different release mechanisms depend on specific applications, which may work simultaneously or in various delivery stages. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development and construction of controlled-release systems. This section describes mechanisms such as diffusion, erosion, dissolution, partition, and swelling. Diffusion and erosion, meanwhile, are referred to as sustained release [51]. For fast metabolized and excreted drugs, sustained-release with the goal of delivering the drug at a predetermined rate for a long-term is important. This mechanism is able to maintain the drug concentration in plasma at a constant level by adjusting the speed and matching the drug-release rate with its elimination rate, thus maintaining the concentration that is critical for cancer treatment. While the release rate, in the immediate release, is not adjustable, the drug concentration in plasma and tissue fluctuates. However, in the general case, nanocarrier are initially emptied very quickly, which may cause several side effects. Table 2 summarizes the main release mechanisms, mathematical models, related polymers, and their advantages and disadvantages."

      "heading" : "3.1. Erosion",
      "text" : "A release mechanism, known variously as the sustained-release, erodible, or biodegradable mechanism, involves erosion or degradation. Since these systems do not require further recovery or manipulation after full release, they are very popular. They are divided into two categories: physical and chemical immobilization systems. In the first class, a polymeric network causes physical immobilization of the active agent, and the drug is released after the net erosion. In the second class,\nthe chemically active agent may itself be part of the structure that these systems form by chemical immobilization. Since erosion systems disappear on-site after drug injection, no invasive intervention is needed, so the particular benefits of erosive systems in pharmaceutical applications are evident. The drawback is that the products used must be excretable or resorbable, and also nontoxic, so pendant chain systems and polydrugs are often considered [57].\nErosion of polymers occurs through surface erosion and bulk erosion (Fig. 2II) [58]. Surface erosion happens when the water penetration rate to the polymer is low or, in other words, hydrolysis is very fast. Surface erosion over time reduces the system's dimensions. The mechanism of surface erosion is considered the preferred mechanism for drug delivery because it creates sustainable drug release. Polyanhydride, among the surface eroding polymers, has strong hydrophobicity that limits water permeation. Moreover, its groups are highly labile, promoting fast hydrolysis of any water molecules [59]. In bulk erosion, in contrast to surface erosion, water molecules penetrate the polymer more rapidly. Thereupon chain breakage happens in the matrix, resulting in a complicated erosion/degradation process in the polymer [60]. The most common degradable polymers with bulk erosion are polyesters. Bulk erosion occurs in three stages: (1) drug release from the system's surface; (2) (known as the latent phase) slight polymer degradation trapping the drugs for slower release; and (3) complete destruction of the polymer matrix and rapid drug release [57].\nThere are many questions about the relationship between erosion and degradation of polymers. Many researchers view these two mechanisms separately. Goepferich and Langer [61], for example, define degradation as the polymer chains' cleavage in monomers and oligomers, while introducing erosion as an overall reduction in polymer weight. In their view, even though erosion involves water-insoluble polymer degradation, that step in itself is not erosion. Langer and Peppas [62] also defined erosion as two types: heterogeneous and homogeneous. First one explains the physical situation of the nanoparticles, in which the penetration of water into the polymer is relative to the degradation rate of polymer. In such a way, the polymer degradation takes place in the outermost layer, and the erosion predominantly occurs at the surface of the dosage form. In the second type of erosion, water penetration happens rapidly, causing degradation to the entire system, followed by bulk erosion. However, many mathematicians believe that the mechanisms of erosion and degradation are the same [44,63–66].\nCarrier erosion as a model of form is Eq. 11, known as the mass increase of Silicon content in the aqueous environment [66]:\n=m t m kt( ) [1 exp( )]Si (11)\nwhere, m∞ and k are mass as t → ∞ and degradation rate, respectively. The rate of erosion is proportional to the pore created in the carrier.

      "text" : "Mass transfer in diffusion, a kinetic process, takes place when systems are not in equilibrium. The diffusion of molecules occurs through the concentration gradient regardless of the priority of the molecular movement in any particular direction. The basis of the most significant phenomena in pharmaceutical fields is the mass exchange from a solvent or solute. In fact, diffusion is the mass exchange process between two [44,63–66]decreases spontaneously and plays a significant role in the diffusion of mass exchange at the system/water interface. Diffusioncontrolled release is generally carried out by means of a reservoir system or matrix-based (monolithic) system [67].\nReservoir systems consist of the main reservoir containing the drug and a membrane surrounding the reservoir. The drug first dissolves in the reservoir and then penetrates the reservoir's membrane to eventually enter the surrounding medium due to the drug concentration gradient in the carrier membrane and the surrounding environment [68]. The drug release rate depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the membrane, the amount of drug-loaded, and the membrane thickness. Despite reservoir systems' simple mechanism and ability to achieve sustained-release, major problems may arise if the membrane has cracks or holes [69]. Recently, hollow nanoparticles have been made from inorganic materials for drug delivery in the treatment of cancer [70–72]. For example, Fe3O4 hollow nanoparticles with 3 nm size pores can slowly and sustainably release cisplatin by diffusion control through these pores. A mechanically and physiologically stable porous shell was used in the study [73]. The fluid nature within the reservoir is also important because when the drug is suspended in the liquid, the good contact with the membrane may result in inconstant release and possibly non-reproducible rates of release. Liquid vehicles have a good contact possibility with the membrane based on the movement of the vehicles themselves. However, precautions must be taken so that the liquid does not flow to the outer surface together with the active agent. Zero-order release capability along with the simple mechanism of reservoir systems has made them extremely advantageous, however it is not very reliable for manufacturing and dosage dumping may take place because of pinhole defects and cracks in the membrane [57].\nIn monolithic nanoparticles or matrix-based agents, drug molecules are scattered throughout the matrix. This type of system has no membrane to act as a barrier to emission. Therefore, drug molecules at the nanoparticle surface usually have a very high initial release rate (a socalled burst release). Subsequently, the release will be retarded until the drugs within the polymer matrix diffuse to the surface [74]. This retardation impact is more pronounced in spherical nanocarriers because the drug molecules in the center are more distant from the surface [69,75]. In one study, only 40% of doxorubicin pre-loaded on PUA nanoparticles was released during six days of incubation [76]. Similarly, over a 28-day period, the amount of docetaxel (Dtxl) released from PCL-Tween nanoparticles was only 35% [77]. The dissolution of the agent in a matrix is necessary for surface diffusion, so a separate step is needed for this process before diffusion can occur. The stages of drug release from a monolithic system can vary. The first stage depends on the drug solubilityin the matrix. When the agent is dissolved, diffusion starts from the surface, where the drug is partitioned off from the matrix and the elution medium, and then transported from the device surface (Fig. 2III).\nMolecular diffusion through artificial membranes and matrix networks is an efficient, safe, simple and reliable strategy for achieving controlled release of several active agents. The occurrence of these phenomena is a decisive step in the complete drug release. During the release operation, a hydrodynamic diffusion layer (boundary layer) may be formed on the outer surface of the nanocarrier that will resist diffusion and slow transport. This phenomenon is exacerbated when solubility is low and the boundary layer is saturated with the active agent, eventually resulting drug-release termination [57]. Drug\ndiffusion is well-defined by Fick's law or Stefan–Maxwell equations. Fick's first diffusion law described reservoir systems where the drug depot is surrounded by a membrane [35,36]:\nGenerally, the diffusion coefficient of drug is considered constant to simplify modeling but is generally a function of drug concentration. In Eq. 1, the drug flux is propotional to the average velocity of system's mass. Accurately predicting drug flux requires the use of a specific correlation involving concentration-dependent drug diffusivity [78].\nFick's second diffusion law (Eq. 2) can be utilized to explain unsteady-state drug diffusion in a 1D slab-shaped matrix in which a drug is uniformly dispersed:\nFor these models, again, the drug diffusion coefficient is considered constant, and a sink condition is assumed. Drug release via the edges of the thin slab-shaped can be ignored. If the diffusivity is assumed to be concentration dependent, then:\n=dC dt x D C dC dx ( )A A A (4)"

      "heading" : "3.3. Dissolution",
      "text" : "Humans and animals consists mainly of water, and drugs must dissolve in this fluid to be released from the carrier and achieve their treatment efficacy. So, dissolution is a very significant mechanism in drug delivery. In this process, solute molecules are transferred from their solid phase to a solvent medium, a process affected by conditions such as temperature and pressure. The drug-release rate from the carrier can be predicted by the rate at which the drug dissolves in the solvent. High solubility of the agent causes the dissolution to occur at a higher rate with no chemical reaction [52]. The process of dissolution takes place when the solvating environment surrounding a drug is unsaturated and may be controlled by the solvating environment, surface area of the solid, boundary layer thickness, and the diffusion coefficient (Fig. 2IV). When the carrier is in contact with the soluble medium, the molecules are removed from the solid surface and dissolved in the solution. The concentration of solute (Cs) increases with the increase of molecules dissolved in the medium. As the solute concentration increases, the possibility of forming a boundary layer around the carrier increases, and the dissolution tends to become saturated and reduces the dissolution rate. Removing the boundary layer renews the solvent and increases the rate of dissolution. Therefore, the difference between the concentration of solute in the outer layer (C2) and the inner layer (C1) predicts the dissolution rate boundary layer. If the difference is large, more dissolution will occur, and if the difference is small, less dissolution occurs. The boundary layer thickness (l) is also very significant, and its size is related to the rate of dissolution. Eq. 15 defines the dissolution process, but if the solute concentration and boundary layer thickness are taken into account, Eq. 16 must be used [57]:\n=dC dt D A C C. ( )s (15)\n=dC dt D A l C C.

      "text" : "Another significant mechanism that affects the control of drug release is partitioning of the drug in the medium. Delivery mechanisms lead drugs to their target site by means of the affinities and polarities of the group or groups of materials making up the delivery system. Therefore, drugs mostly find intermediates between the two substances (polymers and hydrophobic and hydrophobic oils) or phases (blood, water, and bio-membranes) (Fig. 2V). Drug movement from one phase to another usually depends on the relative concentration gradient or chemical potentials, and a drug's degree affinity for each phase. This affinity is measurable with the drug solubility ratio in two phases and is determined as the partition coefficient [57]:\n=P C C o\nw (17)\nCo: concentration in the oil or hydrophobic phase, Cw: concentration in the hydrophilic or aqueous phase. The relative frequency of molecules moving to one medium instead\nof another at the interface is governed by the partition coefficient."

      "heading" : "3.5. Swelling",
      "text" : "Another mechanism used to release drugs is swelling-controlled delivery, in which the release rate depends on the rate at which hydrophilic carriers swell when their molecules are exposed to water (Fig. 2VI) [57]. Polymers are one of the main materials used in the preparation of swelling-controlled delivery systems. Polymers, in contact with water, expand their network, forming chemical or physical bonds. Drug release operations in these systems work because the penetration of water into the polymer system increases its thickness and volume. Sequential rupture of polymer chains and drug dissolution to counteract the increase in thickness results in a reduced matrix volume.\nEventually, the matrix disappears as the entire polymer swells. These types of systems are known as swellable soluble matrices [79]. In them, swelling often precedes the polymer's dissolution. However, in some cases, due to the large length of the polymer chain, the swelling is restricted and the matrix does not disappear. Two factors that determine the swelling rate of polymers are the density of cross-links between the polymer chains and the hydrophobicity of the polymer [48]. The hydrophobicity prevent water from penetrating the polymer sufficiently, resulting in no significant swelling which limits drug release. Other factors that can affect swelling and the release rate control include temperature, pH, and the proper selection of polymers and additives [48].\nThe drug release rate from the polymer matrix relies on two important parameters: (i) diffusion time, defined by t = δ(t)2/D, representing the rate-limiting step, here δ(t) denotes the thickness that is dependent on the swollen phase, and (ii) relaxation time of polymer chain, in swelling-controlled delivery λ is the rate-limiting step. Comparing the two time-scales requires a Deborah number (De) [80,81]:\n= =De t D t( )2 (18)\nIn diffusion-controlled delivery systems, the De is smaller than one, but in swelling-controlled delivery systems, the De is greater than one.

      "heading" : "4.1. Passive targeting",
      "text" : "It has been more than 30 years since the aggregation of specific macromolecules in tumors was confirmed. At the time, researchers began to investigate the phenomenon by observing the distribution of poly (Styrene-co-Maleic Acid)-NeoCarzinoStatin (SMANCS), in the vicinity of tumors, in their early preclinical stage. Using labeled albumin and other proteins, they observed that the particles were distributed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumor and remained there for a long time [12]. This distribution was attributed to the poor lymphatic drainage and imperfect blood vessels of the tumor. The combination of these two phenomena was recognized to cause EPR effect, which is a passive targeting mechanism. Since then, the EPR effect has motivated many researchers to try different drug combinations to fight cancer. EPR effect includes complex biological processes such as vascular permeability, heterogeneity in tumor genetic profiles, hemodynamic regulation, heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis, leading to this phenomenon becoming a blanket term [83]. As biological properties vary among tumor types and patients, the accumulation and distribution of nanoparticles in a tumor are multifaceted and influenced by the biological and physico-chemical characteristics of each material. However, with the development of personalized treatment, naming EPR as a simple self-explaining phenomenon might be becoming obsolete [83]. The fundamentals of EPR and the characteristics that affect it are discussed next."

      "heading" : "4.1.1. EPR",
      "text" : "As a tumor grows, normal blood vessels are unable to supply the oxygen needed for cell proliferation, so cells start to die because the oxygen demand of the growing cancer cells is greater than the amount of oxygen supplied [36,86,87]. This process leads to the secretion of new blood vessel germination factors from surrounding capillaries, a stage known as angiogenesis. Features of new blood vessels include a discontinuous epithelium, an irregular vessel network, and the absence of the basement membrane of normal vascular structures [88–91]. The fenestrations in the capillary may vary from 200 to 2000 nm, depending on the tumor type, resulting in reduced resistance to extravasation of blood components to the tumor ECM [92]. The result is enhanced permeation part of the EPR effect. In normal tissue, the interstitial fluid is continuously drained to the lymph vessels, allowing solutes and colloids to return to the bloodstream [93], but in tumor tissue, the lymphatic system is malfunctioning, leading to minimal, or even no, interstitial flow uptake [94–96]. As a consequence, the nanoparticles cannot depend on convective forces to return them to circulation, and the diffusion of nanoparticles is impeded by their larger hydrodynamic radii. Thus, nanoparticles that reach the periphery of the vasculature are not effectively cleared, and so aggregate in the tumor ECM. This situation demonstrates the enhanced retention part of the EPR effect [83].\nDistribution of nanoparticles in solid tumors is mainly accomplished by three distinctive and interrelated phenomena, including extravasation and diffusion through the interstitium, both influenced by nanoparticles characteristics and tumor biology, and is controlled by diffusive and convective forces (Fig. 3). The last phenomenon is the interaction of nanoparticles with intracellular and/or extracellular\ntargets in the TME. Given that this case characterizes the phenomenon of cellular uptake or cellular destruction and metabolism through the interaction of nanoparticles with the tumor, it is much more difficult to understand than the first two. The processes mentioned may influence the mechanism of accumulation and the equilibrium of accumulation in the tumor interstitium [83,97].\nExtravasation of nanoparticles depends on various factors such as the vascular wall permeability, the concentration of nanoparticles in the blood, and the nature of the tumor microenvironment. Mathematical equations play a significant role in describing the effect of each of these parameters on extravasation. Although these equations have many parameters and variables to describe these factors, they are also independently useful for identifying the consequences of each biological and physico-chemical property. Therefore, for the description of the extravasation, Eq. 20 is defined thus [83]:\n= +J PA C C L A P P C BLACKBOX( ) [( ) ( )](1 )tot v i Diffusive force P v i v i F v Convective force (20)\nDiffusive force This term comes from modifying Fick's first law to describe the vessel wall permeability (P) and the blood vessel area (A). This component also originates from the Brownian nanoparticles motion, which, given the concentration gradient between the vessels (Cv) and the interstitium (Ci), is in the direction of the movement toward the interstitium. Convective force In this term, the fluid flux is described by Stirling's law, where LP is hydraulic conductivity of the microvascular wall, Pv is the vascular hydrostatic pressures and Pi is interstitial hydrostatic pressures, πv is the vascular oncotic pressure and πi is interstitial oncotic pressure, and σ is the average osmotic reflection coefficient.\nInteractions between nanoparticles with dendritic cells and macrophages influence the diffusion of nanoparticles in the Tumor microenvironments (Ci). Overall, researchers have shown that as the phagocytic cell level increases in the tumor ECM, the accumulation of nanoparticles also increases [98]. Finally, another important point is the differentiation of nanoparticles accumulated by EPR from the encapsulated payload aggregation (drug release). Specific features are different when encapsulated and released, so their release kinetics, as well as their interactions with the tumor microenvironment, should be considered. The BLACK BOX is considered to describe all the effective parameters in preserving nanoparticles. In this equation, it leads to opportunities to discover more about the biology of cancer and nanotechnology. For example, some researchers describe the increased interaction of cationic nanoparticles with endothelial cells as permeability, while others think that the interactions result from endothelial uptake and endocytosis [83].\nOnce the nanoparticles have extravasated to the tumor, they enter the interstitial fluid, which is composed of cancer cells, stroma cells, and the ECM. The nanoparticles in the interstitial fluid are guided by convection and diffusion forces and other phenomena defined by Eq. 21 as follows [83]:\n= +C t D C v C Ri eff i Diffusive component i i\nInterstitial concentration\n2\nConvective component (21)\nDiffusive force This factor is based on the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) and concentration variation in different directions (∇2Ci). Convective force This term differs from the direction and intensity of convection motion (v), the spatial concentration gradient (∇Ci), and a coefficient (φ) to describe the fact that the velocity of colloid in the porous interstitium might be v from the fluid velocity (e.g., exclusion, drag or adsorption impacts).\nThe Ri factor is related to the behavior of nanoparticles in the face of biological properties. This factor may indicate nanoparticles binding to the ECM, their uptake by cancer cells, their capture by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), or even the metabolism. The negative sign justifies further interactions with the tumor lead to reduced motion.\nThe tumor microenvironments is a congested entanglement of collagen fibers and glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which have an in heterogeneous distribution of protein solutes and cellular debris, leading to irregular distribution in the tumor and severely impeding fluid diffusion and convection [97]. Two important parameters that influence nanoparticle convection through the vascular wall are abnormal traffic due to local interstitial hydrodynamic (Pi) pressures and oncotic pressures (πi) [99,100]. The ECM's nature also regulates the release and convection of the nanoparticles after extravasation. In the tumor ECM, in vivo and ex vivo studies have demonstrated that the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) is less than that measured for nanoparticles in simple solutions [101,102]. The content of collagen and its organization in the ECM also reduces interstitial diffusion (Deff↓) [103]. Eventually, cells from the MPS are extravasated to the ECM. The affinity of these macrophages for colloids and the resulting phagocytic activity can further\nhinder Nanoparticles ‘mobility than cancer cells, while enhancing their retention in the tumor ECM [104]. There have also been reports that hyaluronidases reduce the nanoparticles diffusion by collapsing hydrated protein structures and enhancing viscosity (Deff↓ and φ↓) [101]. Human studies have shown that the patients’ age and the activity of their intrinsic MPS are associated with the clearance of nanoparticles from the blood [105]. Reports illustrate that older patients experience higher blood exposure to nanoparticles and in comparison with younger patients, they have less hematological toxicity, indicating that the PDs of nanoparticles affected by interactions of nanoparticles and the MPS [106]. Increasing our knowledge of EPR is gradually suggesting approaches for optimizing tumor microenvironments for better distribution of nanoparticles. Table 4 presents strategies for improving EPR function by modifying tumor biology.\nThere has been talk about the relationship between the EPR effect and tumor biology; however, the effect of the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles on accumulation should not be overlooked. The physico-chemical characteristics of nanoparticles affect extravasation by influencing the diffusivity (Deff), permeability (P and LP), drag coefficient (σF and φ), and interactions in the tumor with the cells and\nthe interstitium (Ri). It is difficult to measure the effect of each of these properties on EPR because of its effects on the overall circulatory kinetics, extravasation processes, and interstitium diffusion. However, the exposure of blood to nanoparticles appears to be an important factor in increasing nanoparticle distribution in the tumor due to EPR [113]. The diffusive and convective forces are influenced by the nanoparticles concentration in the bloodstream (Ci), so maintaining a high blood concentration is significant in ensuring unilateral diffusion to the tumor and preventing the impact of tumor output when Ci > Cv [114]. So, a long circulation time is needed to increase extravasation into the tumor. Table 5 describes the different properties of nanoparticles needed to improve EPR performance."

      "text" : "Successful nanoparticle-based treatment is achieved when nanoparticles are taken up by cancer cells. The previous section presented the principles of nanoparticles accumulation in a tumor and strategies for increased accumulation, but these strategies are not sufficient to achieve cellular uptake. The use of affinity ligands on the nanoparticle surface, termed active targeting, increases the chances of cellular uptake, also known as ligand-mediated targeting [120–122]. For this purpose, ligands capable of binding to molecules or receptors on the surface of cancer cells are selected. To increase the rate of binding, the ligand must be close to the receptor. This approach has been defined by increasing the interaction between nanoparticles and cells to enhance internalization without altering biodistribution [123,124]. Complex features such as nanoparticles architecture, a ligand's type, ligand conjugate chemistry, and the kinds of ligand available all contribute to the efficiency of the DDS, but including them makes the design of an arbitration carrier extremely difficult. Other factors such as the type of administration, nonspecific binding, and protein uptake on the nanoparticles also affect the targeting of nanoparticles [125,126]. In addition, physico-chemical properties such as ligand density, nanoparticles size, and the choice of targeting ligand may affect this strategy's performance with in silico or in vitro models, and most importantly in vivo ones [127,128]. The advantages and features associated with this strategy are highlighted next."

      "heading" : "4.2.1. Fundamental of active targeting",
      "text" : "The major active targeting mechanism is the identification of nanoparticles surface ligands by cancer cells. Various ligands eantibodies and fragments, proteins, peptides, sugars, nucleic acidse and small molecules like vitamins have been introduced [129]. Target receptors can be sugars, lipids, or proteins present in the cancer cell surface [130]. Interactions of different nanoparticles architectures with different ligand copies enhance the nanoparticles recognition for its targets [131]. Two important features used to assess the performance of an active targeted approach are specificity and delivery capacity. Specificity is determined by the ligand and nanoparticles features and the delivery capacity is directly proportional to the material and structure\nof nanoparticles. Specificity, defined by the bio-distribution of the ligand-functionalized nanoparticles and by how the conjugated ligand and the nanoparticles system interact with off-target molecules and cells, is determined by the ligand and nanoparticles features. The delivery capacity is directly associated with the material and structure of nanoparticles [132]. Active targeting is currently a promising supplement to EPR, further enhancing the efficacy of nanoparticles in cancer treatment. Since the targets are in the ECM, and the nanoparticles depend on the EPR effect to achieve their goals, the EPR effect is actually a prerequisite for successful targeting [133,134].\nThe approaches used to introduce ligands, since nanoparticles avidity is directly dependent to the density of ligand, are key aspects of active target systems. The primary strategy considered is covalent ligand coupling, but physical adsorption by affinity complexes can still be utilized efficiently [135]. Since organic and inorganic materials have various physico-chemical characteristics, the particle type will specify the hardness of the ligand conjugation step [136]. Ligands that are noncovalently bound to a lipid layer need hydrophobic anchors to stabilize then in vivo [137]. Fig. 4I describes ligand conjugation/adsorption strategies, with a focus on biodegradable polymers. In polymer matrices, surface erosion mainly occurs homogeneously and the tethered ligands can be considered as polymer degraders [137].\nThe properties of targeting nanoparticles may be altered by conjugation of ligands on the nanoparticles surface [61]. With the loss of rotational and translational freedom bestowed to free molecules by the ligands, as the valency is increased, the targeted entity achieves improved avidity [138]. In some cases, nanoparticles have demonstrated performance advantages beyond normal drug delivery. For instance, strands of nucleic acids immobilized on a nanoparticles surface are more resistant to the degradation of nucleases [139]. Determining the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles (ligand density, size, geometry, surface features (charge and hydrophobicity), and nanoparticle composition) is crucial for understanding the properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with targets. Fig. 4II describes the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles.\nProper ligand selection is crucial for the efficiency of nanoparticles with active targeting. Antibodies, the first targeted systems, were welcome due to their high specificity and wide availability [140]. Since then, other ligands such as nucleic acid ligands, peptides, proteins, and small molecules are introduced. Fig. 4III discusses various topics related to ligands that may lead to their effective targeting. The strategy of employing transferrin (Tf) to target transferrin-receptor (Tf-R) is now undergoing clinical trials for different NP types [141–143]."

Chronopharmacology studies have shown strong circadian dependencies in some conditions such as tumorigenesis and cancer progression [145]. Rapid release of a drug into the interstitium from the nanoparticles may cause premature release and systemic side effects. However, slow release decreases drug efficacy and increases multiple-drug resistance (MDR). Therefore, effective treatment requires intelligent control of how a drug is released in response to in vivo physiological circumstances or external stimuli [146,147]. The use of bio-responsive nanocarriers has the potential to modify traditional delivery protocols [148]. Drug release in humans and animals falls into two categories, depending on whether it is induced by internal or external stimuli [16]. As bio-responsive nanocarriers are exposed to related stimuli, a physico-chemical changes occurs in the system, for example, swelling, decay, and dissociation, resulting in structural transfer of the nanoparticles and eventual drug release [149]. Although stimulant-sensitive systems are stable under physiological conditions, they also release drugs at a high rate at the target site, thus ensuring that rapid growth reduces MDR. Additionally, release at a specific target reduces side effects [150]. The rapid response of DDSs to the stimulus allows for real-time manipulation of drug doses and the ability to achieve sufficient concentration of drug in a tumor's interstitium [151,152]. The wide variety of the response mechanisms that help control drug release are discussed in this section. Table 6 also summarizes the stimuli and their associated characteristics."

      "text" : "One important characteristic of the tumor microenvironments in solid tumors that has been extensively investigated is tumor acidosis [163], caused by hypoxia and the accumulation of extracellular lactic acid in tumors. Lactic acid is the result of hypoxia, caused by cell death in the absence of oxygen [164,165]. Studies have shown that in addition to the tumor response to hypoxia, other complex metabolic processes, including tumor respiration, H+ and HCO3− transport, and extracellular H+ venting, also affect tumor acidity. Overexpression of HIF-α increases the glycolytic flux. As a result, key processes in generating and transporting H+, that is, the transcription and expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), may undergo more upregulation [166,167]. In the tumor microenvironments, both the normoxic regions and the deep hypoxic regions are acidic. However, reports suggest that the normoxic region is almost neutral since it lies near microvascular network of tumor blood, and so released H+ ions can be washed out by venting into the bloodstream. Consequently, the pH of this area may be as high as 7 (7.0–7.4). At the same time, the deep hypoxic region, with its estimated pH of 6.7–6.9 is not actually the most acidic. The most acidic region of the tumor microenvironments is in fact the mediate hypoxia region, which been identified because it produces CO2 during cancer cell respiration, causing oxidative cancer cells to produce more acid [168]. Fig. 5(I, II, III) summarizes recent findings on acidosis. In addition to the extracellular environment, the intracellular pH content of cancer cells differs from that of normal cells. However, unlike the extracellular pH, the intracellular pH is higher than that of normal cells (7.2), which is slightly alkaline (7.4) [169]. This intracellular property is the result of a complex metabolic mechanism that supports cancer cells to proliferate and prevent apoptosis [170]. The intracellular pH discussed herein indicates the pH value of the cytosol. The pH values in the\ndifferent compartments within cells vary. The most alkaline subcellular compartment is the mitochondria (pH ~ 8.0), and the most acidic is the lysosomes (pH ~ 4.7) [171]. What is significant in delivery of drug delivery is the continuous variations in pH during endocytosis. The pH value is 6.3 in the early endosome and 5.5 in the late endosome, eventually reaching 4.7 in the lysosome (Fig. 5IV). The pH gradients between intra- and extracellular matrices and also between tumor and healthy tissue are important foundations for the design and construction of pH-responsive DDSs for differential drug partitioning and distribution [172]. The usage of pH-responsive nanoparticles in the treatment of cancer is prominent because of the unique and ubiquitous properties of tumor acidity among DDSs. Drugs are primarily released from pH-responsive nanoparticles due to reactions such as swelling, cleavage, and protonation. The mechanism of drug release due to swelling has been described in 3.5. The most important factor that separates pH-assembled nanocarriers is protonation, and in pH-sensitive covalent bonds, the cleavage causes nanocarriers disruption. Cleavage usually occurs in pH-sensitive covalent bonds, and protonation is the major force driving the dissociation of assembled pH-responsive NC [173]. In a low-pH ECM, the uncharged portion of a weak acid is enhanced, which promotes drug diffusion via the cell membrane [174]. Various types of nanoparticles that are sensitive to pH have been confirmed, including nanoparticles of polymer particles, liposomes, micelles, and dendrimers. In pH-sensitive micelles assembled from the Cholesterol-Conjugated Peptide His10Arg10 (HR20-Chol), histidine layers with a pH of less than six become swollen from condensed state, leading to cleavage of the micelle and increased release and diffusion of doxorubicin (Fig. 5V) [175]."

      "text" : "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E, and glutathione (GSH) are reducing agents that widely exist in the human body [178,179]. It has been confirmed that the tumor ECM is an oxidative medium, whereas the intracellular space is a reductive environment. In body fluids such as blood and ECM, the concentration of GSH, a thiol-containing tripeptide, is almost 2–20 μM, but this is within the intracellular, in the range of 2 to 10 mM [180]. In some cancer cells (especially drug-resistant ones), the GSH concentration may be several times that amount [158]. The concentration of GSH in cells is maintained by glutathione reductase at a constant level, leading to a highly reductive cell environment [181]. The GSH concentration in tumor and the cytosol of tumor cells is more than four times normal tissue, thus, tumor can be assumed a reducing medium, compared to normal tissue. In the subcellular compartments, the cytoplasm provides an environment for redox signaling because of its metabolic oxidases. Mitochondria have the most reductive environment, which makes them highly sensitive to oxidation. Nuclei, despite having low redox potential, are highly resistant to oxidation. The functional status of cells ethe induction of differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and adhesione affects the redox potential of cells. An overview of the biologically relevant redox couples and the compartmental organization of cells and their function is shown in Fig. 6I [182,183]. The important differences between intracellular and extracellular environments, as well as between tumor and normal tissue, have led to a great deal of attention being paid to redox-responsive nanocarriers for intracellular drug release through thiolysis in the existence of GSH [184]. In these delivery systems, the payload and delivery are secure and drug release is intracellular. They also have great potential because of their rapid response and intrinsic selectivity [185,186]. Redox-sensitive degradable nanocarriers, are more challenging to use than other nanocarriers but have useful properties, such as good response to high intracellular GSH levels, the direct drug release to the nucleus and cytosol, and good stability in the ECM where GSH levels are low [187]. Furthermore, in redox environments, the presence of activated macrophages in certain tumors has led to the increased selective release of drugs at the tumor site [155]. A set of redox couples like NADP +/NADPH has the task of managing and\n(caption on next page)\nregulating the redox environment [188]. GSH-responsive Nanocarriers have been widely introduced, including polymeric micelles, nanogels, inorganic nanoparticles [189]. Many GSH-responsive systems like pHresponsive materials are sensitive to acidic groups. Generally, in GSHresponsive block copolymers, there is a disulfide linkage between hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, which leads to the formation of micelles known as shell-sheddables. The interaction of these micelles with GSH causes their destabilization, leading to drug release (Fig. 6II) [180]. In GSH-responsive RGD containing peptides after cellular uptake, doxorubicin was quickly released due to cleaving of the disulfide bonds, triggered by GSH (Fig. 6III) [190]."

      "text" : "cancer cells are under increasing oxidative stresses, leading to alterations in metabolic activity and oncogenic transformation [191–193]. Inspired by this result, researchers consider the inherent oxidative stress of cancer cells a unique stimulus in therapeutic applications. One well-known biological stimulus is known as the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Normally, ROS contain the superoxide anion (O2−1), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (OH), and one type of ROS species can be converted into another via a series of reaction processes (Fig. 7I) [194,195]. An increasing ROS level plays a significant role in the onset and cancer growth, so its concentration is higher in cancers [191,196]. Reports indicate that the concentration in cancer cells reaches 100 μM emore than 100 times that of normal cells [197,198]. Overproduction of ROS after the treatments of exogenetic agents, due to the increased oxidative stress, can make cancer cells more susceptible to damage and is toxic to cells [198]. Therefore, cancer cells, to balance ROS generation, employ non-enzyme ROS scavengers, including GSH and vitamins C and E, to adapt to oxidative stress [175]. ROS may be endogenously produced by mitochondrial metabolism either from the NADPH enzyme or exogenously by photodynamic or non-photodynamic actions [199]. However, the main producer of intracellular ROS are the mitochondria. Among the types of ROS present in the microenvironment, H2O2 exhibits the highest intracellular concentration and highest stability, although it has the lowest reactivity. Recent studies have shown that the specialized enzyme that produces ROS has a very beneficial function in treating cancer [197]. The presence of the ROS gradient, and the ability to break various bonds, have led to greater emphasis on the role of ROS-responsive nanocarriers in the development of DDSs. Some units used in making nanoparticles for ROS-responsive DDS include Poly (thioketal) [200], Selenium-containing polymers [201], Ferumoxyltol [202], Manganese dioxide [203], and Poly (propylene sulfide) [204]. The thioketal group is more popular. ROS cleave thioketal groups in polymer chains, breaking them down meanwhile, the thioketal bond shows a high sensitivity to ROS and leads to payload release, as well as eliminating excess ROS [205–207]. Depending on the structure of ROSresponsive nanocarriers (the design of linkers), the major mechanisms of drug release can be modulated by ROS-induced carrier dissolution, ROS-induced carrier cleavage, or ROS-induced prodrug linker cleavage (Fig. 7II) [208]."

      "text" : "The exceptional biological recognition ability and prominent catalytic properties of enzymes have made them important components in the nanotechnology toolbox. In different cancer-related processes progression, metastasis, angiogenesis, and degradation of the ECMeenzymes play a key role [209,210]. Therefore, they can be used as effective stimuli in nanoparticles-based DDSs. Enzyme-responsive DDSs undergo bio-catalytic action of the enzyme and have high\nperformance and selectivity in enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which is very useful in treatment [211,212]. The design of such systems generally utilizes either chemical or physical processes. Chemically, the interaction of the nanoparticles with the enzyme causes various nanoparticles structures to degrade from the polymer matrix to their mesoporous silica cores and release their drug load [213]. In the physical mode, the nanoparticles macro-scale structure is changed by the enzyme to release the drug. In this method, molecules embedded at the nanocarrier surface react with the enzyme to alter the physical characteristics of the nanocarrier [214]. The mechanism of release in enzyme-responsive nanoparticles is as follows: one component is considered to respond to the enzyme, and usually consists of a substrate or a substrate mimic of the enzyme. The second one is related to variations inside the nanoparticle for macroscopic transfer and drug release [155]. Fig. 8 illustrates the typical enzymatic release modes. Drugs can be loaded into nanocarriers directly via covalent attachment or physically encapsulated, including a cross-linked matrix, self-assembled system or caged porous structure. Enzymes can help to internalization targeted ligands into certain cells, and can promote an acidic medium for drug release from carriers [215]. Nanomaterials that have been used to respond to enzymes include polymers, phosphor esters, and inorganic materials [216,217]. In a tumor site, the ester bonds or peptide structures of nanocarriers may fracture due to the presence of certain enzymes and so release the therapeutic agent [218].\nOne important enzyme of interest in enzyme-responsive DDSs is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). This enzyme, known as a biomarker, is associated with invasive cancer cells and metastasis, and is involved in ECM remodeling [175,209]. Different types of MMP are related to cancer progression, but two cases, MMP2 and MMP9, are overexpressed in some kinds of tumors. Many nanoparticles that are responsive to MMP are mainly based in the sequence of peptides that are cleaved by MMP2 and MMP9, and particularly by the MMP2 [219–221]. Other important enzymes are protease enzymes that play a major role in many processes such as cell proliferation, homeostasis, necrosis, angiogenesis, differentiation, and apoptosis [222]. Therefore, these enzymes have been welcomed by researchers trying to design ideal DDSs for drug release from carriers at particular areas inside cells [19]. Proteases are predominantly produced by cancer cells, although they may also be produced by other cells present at a tumor location. Other enzymes used include elastase and azuractactase enzymes. Elastase enzymes, another type of protease, degrades collagen [223]. Azoreductase, secreted by the microbial flora existing in the human colon, is used as a drug release target for colon cancer [224]."

      "heading" : "5.1.5. Hypoxia-responsive nanocarriers",
      "text" : "Incomplete vasculature networks within solid tumors and the limited distance for oxygen diffusion (200 μm) interfere with the provision of the oxygen needed for cancer cells, resulting in oxygen deprived cells that form a hypoxic region. Hypoxia is a unique pathological feature found in 50–60% of solid tumors [225–227]. The partial pressure of oxygen gradually decreases from the surface of a tumor to its core, where the partial pressure may be 0–2.5 mmHg, compared to the 30–40 mmHg in healthy cells [228,229]. Hypoxia is always present during tumor growth, even in tumors as small as 1 mm [230]. The highly diverse features found in hypoxic and normoxic tissues provide a framework for DDSs that are activated by decreased oxygen's partial pressure [231]. Nitroaromatics and azo derivatives, used as hypoxicresponsive nanocarriers, are frequently grafted into amphiphilic copolymers to form hypoxia-responsive carriers [232–234]. They form the substrates for Nitroreductase (NI) and Azoreductase, whose cellular levels are hypoxia dependent and rapidly reduce in association with\nFig. 5.

Physical and chemical changes lead to changes of the nanocarrier structure, resulting in “burst” drug release [235–237]. Recently, the combination of NI derivatives and phospholipid layers to encapsulated doxorubicin in targeting hypoxic cells has been considered. The nanocarrier enters the target cell cytoplasm via endocytosis, during which hypoxia-induced bioreductive metabolism facilitated the structural NI derivatives, which leads to disruption of lipid layers and disruption of the carrier structure. This procedure results in the release of doxorubicin about 36% after half an hour (Fig. 9) [238]. Such carriers have high thermodynamic stability and are expected to accumulate densely in tumors through EPR effect. The lactic acid and redox potential induced by hypoxia-induced behavior also stimulate drug release, as described in [239–241]."

These stimuli have been more widely welcomed than those already\ndiscussed. This section briefly examines each. Inflammation is one of the prominent features of cancer [242], including bladder, colon, cervical, gastric, thyroid, prostate, and ovarian cancers. In some cancers, inflammation occurs before malignant changes, while in other types, an inflammatory microenvironment resulting from oncogenic changes leads to tumor growth and progression [243]. cancer cells produce growth factors, chemokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory cells migrate to tumor sites and then become activated, and an array of cytokines are secreted, involving tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which support tumor proliferation and survival [244]. The discovery of this unique feature results in opening of a novel research field focused on optimizing carrier aggregation, cellular internalization, and effective drug release from nanocarriers. In these types of responsive systems, the drug is encapsulated in the nanocarriers and then integrated with immune cells according to covalent bond, noncovalent absorption, endocytosis processes or particular antibody-antigen interactions [203,245].\nATP plays an important role in cell signaling and metabolism and is\nknown as the energy currency of the cell. The gradient of ATP concentrations between extracellular (< 0.4 mM) and intracellular (1–10 mM) spaces has led to the potential use of ATP as a stimulant in DDSs over the past few years [154]. Reports in studies of murine lymphoma L5178Y cells and mouse leukemia L 1210 have shown that ATP levels in tumor tissue are much higher than in normal tissue [246]. However, in the hepatoma 3924A cells in rats, the ATP concentration is 43% lower than in normal tissue, indicating that these types of delivery systems are not appropriate for hepatoma [247]. For other tumors, this stimulus was typically used in adjusting the intracellular and extracellular “stability” of the carriers for enhanced blood circulation and on-demand drug release [154]. Four types of modules have been introduced in these systems: (1) phenylboronic acid-sugar-functional polymers; (2) ATP consumer enzymes; (3) Zinc dipicolylamine (TDPAZn2+); and (4) ATP aptamers having a strong affinity with ATP. The ATP aptamer module has received more attention because of its relatively short sequence (~30 bases), specific response, and simple modification [154].\nIonic microenvironment-responsive polymeric nanoparticles are designed by incorporating pendant acidic or primary functional entities in the polymer backbone. Acidic pendants affect the ionization degree. The mechanism of drug release from ionic microenvironment-responsive nanoparticles depends on the degree of ionization of the nanocarrier. Increasing the number of pendant acidic groups in polymercarriers leads to electrostatic repulsion between negatively-charged carboxyl groups on multiple chains, which in turn leads to greater swelling ratios at a high pH. In contrast, numerous amines are present in polymeric carriers at low pH and are known to ionize and exhibit electrostatic repulsion [248]. Such carriers release the loaded drug by accepting or donating protons with high sensitivity to ionic magnitude changes or by responding to pH in the aqueous medium. In general, lower critical solution temperature (LCST) polymers are very suitable for the development of DDSs responsive to ionic environments [249]."

      "text" : "Limited evidence suggests that the environmental changes between cancerous and normal tissues that ideally act as internal stimuli for drug release may not always be present due to deviations between individual patients. Therefore, in some cases where normal biological stimuli do not function properly, external stimuli are more suitable for drug release from nanocarriers. Using such external sources changes the energy level in chain dynamics and alters the molecular interaction of nanocarriers at the critical drug delivery onset point [250]. Drug release in the presence of external stimuli, unlike with biological stimuli, is accomplished in a regulated system of spatial and temporal control over a particular organ, thus producing the least toxicity [251,252]. The use of external stimuli also allows pulsatile drug release, that is, rapid and regular bursts of payload after a predetermined off-release period [253]. Despite the many benefits of such external actuators, specialized equipment and devices are needed to produce a specific actuator, and is costly. This section examines a wide range of features related to these stimuli, including their performance, functional nanocarriers, and their release."

      "heading" : "5.2.1. Temperature-sensitive nanocarriers",
      "text" : "Temperature plays an important role in cellular metabolism. The appropriate temperature for cell metabolism is 37°C, but many pathological sites, such as tumor tissue, are generally 1–2°C above the normal level, a state known as hyperthermia [254,255]. In addition, tumor tissue can be heated externally, which, in addition to helping to release drugs, also increases pore size, which increases blood flow. The results are increased perfusion, which leads to increase extravasation of nanocarriers. Temperature can be used as an internal or external stimulus [256], with the appropriate range for triggering temperature stimuli DDSs being 37–42°C. Excessive temperature will cause protein denaturation [257].\nTemperature as an external stimulus is particularly useful. Thermally responsive DDSs have several advantages, such as rapid response to temperature changes, low toxicity to non-cancerous tissue, improved localization of cancer drugs, prevention of overdose, and better drug use [258]. External sources such as ultra-sound, magnetic fields, electric fields, and light are used to increase the temperature. The Pennes' bio-heat equation (Eq. 22) [259,260] is used to investigate the temperature distribution caused by the above stimuli in tumor and normal tissue. The equation contains a special term that represents the heat exchange between blood flow and tissues; Qext is the energy deposition rate due to stimuli, and Qm is the metabolism, which is usually negligible in comparison with the external power deposition term [261].\n= + +\n+\nc T t\nk c w T TT ( ) Q\nQ\nbl bl bl bl m\next\nThe heat sink term due to blood perfusion The heat generated by metabolism\nThe external power deposition term (22)\nT: tissue temperature, c: heat capacity under constant pressure related to the tissue, cbl: heat capacity under constant pressure related to the blood, wbl: rate of blood perfusion, ρbl: density of blood, ρ: density of tissue, k: thermal conductivity, Tbl: blood temperature (which is set to 37 °C). Different terms are used for Qext depending on the type of stimulus,\nas will be discussed later.\nThe most-common temperature-responsive carriers are liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, nanogels, inorganic, etc., as illustrated in Fig. 10I the nanocarriers must be stable within the body temperature range, and they release their payload in the presence of the stimulus by increasing the temperature to 40–42°C. The main mechanism describing nanocarrier responsiveness to temperature is related to alteration of their solubility behavior via temperature alterations and phase transitions that affect their volume [164]. Several types of important nanocarriers are discussed below.\nTemperature-sensitive liposomes (TSLs) are among the most advanced thermo-responsive nanocarriers. Temperature-responsive liposomes are usually caused by the phase transition of the constitutive lipids and their conformational changes in the lipids [16]. The importance of liposomes forming lipid layers is that it reduces drug side effects, limits toxicity, and reduces drug uptake in normal tissues [155]. Doxorubicin loaded in temperature-sensitive lipomas has reached a phase III trial for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and is currently undergoing a phase II trial for the treatment of breast cancer and colorectal liver metastasis [262]. The biological processes involved in liposomes have been represented in a number of mathematical and multi-compartment (Fig. 10II) models, with varying degrees of success [263]. These models provide different insights into the delivery of liposome carriers, the bio-availability in tumor tissue, and the associated levels and locations [264–266]. In particular, mathematical models of TSL delivery for temperature-dependent release kinetics require spatiotemporal profiles of temperature as input. The profiles can be obtained by considering a homogeneous distribution of optimal temperature throughout the tumor area or by coupling with an external\nheat source through a bio-heat transfer model [267]. Studies on the importance of TSLs have shown that the release of liposomes occurs at above normal body temperature at 42 °C (Fig. 10III) [268], and overall temperature increases enhance liposomes release rate. This rate varies depending on the drug release profile and drug type (Fig. 10IV).\nTemperature-sensitive polymers are known from temperature-sensitive nanoparticles in DDSs. As temperature changes, these polymers change from reduced to swollen or vice versa. Since the variation in solubility is temperature dependent, the interesting characteristics of the polymers can help release encapsulated drugs. They are determined by an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) or a LCST. Slightly varying the temperature from the UCST or LCST directly affects swelling or shrinkage (Fig. 10V) [269,270]. Temperatures below the LCST and above the UCST lead to increased hydrophobicity, a change that influences the swelling of carriers, and thus forms a basis for release regulation [271]. In the field of DDS, the LCSTs of polymers and systems are of particular importance. The accumulation of polymer at the LCST is dependent on the entropy (ΔS) of the two-phase water-polymer system. Positive entropy increases the temperature, which boosts accumulation [272,273], which is also encouraged by positive enthalpy H (which is smaller than the entropy term). In these conditions, the association is desirable as the free association energy (ΔG = H − TΔS) is negative. Theoretically, a negative excess entropy of mixing is needed for an LCST; however, the nature of polymer–water interactions may also be responsible [274–276].\nThe above discussion highlights the importance of increased temperature for drug release, but more interesting is cold shock or cryotherapy. This method, a subset of temperature-sensitive DDSs, relies on reducing tumor temperatures. In this case, the mechanism for releasing encapsulated drugs is reversible swelling or de-swelling of nanoparticles as a result of enhanced porosity and permeability [16]. Smart “nano-bombs” of this class are temperature-sensitive delivery systems that, as the temperature decreases, cause carriers to swell from nanoscale to microscale. For example, super-expandable Pluronic/PEI nanogels with a diameter of 150 nm at 37°C are internalized by cancer cells through an endocytosis mechanism. By lowering the temperature to 20 °C under a phase transition with a dramatic swelling of the nanogel, the nanocarrier increases to 1.4 mm in diameter, i.e., 800 times its original size, elevating the cells' hydrostatic pressure. This process breaks down intracellular endosomal compartments, which in turn, “blows up” and thus kill tumor cells (Fig. 10VI) [277]. In addition, drugs such as doxorubicin can be loaded into nano-gels and released inside cancer cells.\nAnother study found that temperature can be used to release drugs, either by increasing or decreasing cell temperature. However, the drug release rate rises over time in parallel with the temperature increase. Therefore, hyperthermic approaches are more effective than cryotherapy ones (Fig. 10VII) [278]. There are no restrictions on the shape of nanoparticles used in this type of DDS, and in fact nanoparticles of various forms are being investigated for temperature-sensitive DDSs (Fig. 10VIII)."

      "heading" : "5.2.2. Ultrasound-sensitive nanocarriers",
      "text" : "Ultrasound is one of the most important external stimuli and has been welcomed in DDS research due to its non-invasiveness, the absence of ionizing radiation, and the facile regulation of tissue penetration depth it allows with adjusting frequency [16]. Ultrasound can release drugs from responsive nanocarriers through thermal or mechanical effects [279]. The design of nanocarriers may vary according to the way ultrasound is used, but three key features need to be considered: (1) reliable and sustained drug encapsulation before the ultrasound waves arrive; (2) high-efficiency drug release performance in response to ultrasound waves; and (3) the ability to monitor drug release for therapeutic purposes [280]. Pulsatile drug release also be achieved through an on/off application. Focused ultrasound beams cause drug release through local hyperthermia caused by the deposition\nof acoustic energy in the target region [281], the heat of which is defined as Qext in the bio-heat equation. For ultrasound, this term is rewritten as follows [282,283].\nk c p t . 2HIFU ABS2 2\n(23)\nkHIFU: thermal conductivity coefficient of HIFU, αABS local absorption coefficient, ω: cancer cell survival constant, ρ: density, c: specific heat,\np t : time average over one acoustic cycle.\n+ P v2( ) 2t b a a 2\n(24)\nαt: absorption coefficient of tissue, αb: absorption coefficient of blood, Pa: acoustic pressure, ρ: density, va: ultrasound speed. Ultrasound increases the permeability of biological barrier such as cell membranes and blood-brain barriers by increasing temperature, leading to increased uptake, release, and production of cavitation bubbles [284]. The most important responsive nanoparticles are TSLs, which are exposed to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) that releases the payload [16]. For example, the combination of HIFU and TSL is used to release doxorubicin in clinical applications for the treatment of metastatic liver cancer, and pancreatic cancer [285]. With the propagation of ultrasound wave pulses, physical phenomena occur, such as local hyperthermia, acoustic streaming, and cavitation, which cause the tearing of phospholipid layers in liposomes and other nanocarriers [280]. Cavitation is the major parameter controlling the response of lipid-based nanocarriers during exposure to ultrasound [286]. Cavitations are gas bubbles that form as the pressure drops below the vapor pressure of the surrounding environment. The bubbles undergo fast expansion and contraction in response to ultrasound pulses. The two types of cavitation, internal and stable, depend on the frequency and amplitude of the US waves, and the size and characteristics of the bubbles [287]. Stable cavitation take places at lower ultrasound intensities and internal cavitation occurs at higher ones [288]. With internal cavitation, gas bubbles occur near or inside the lipid layer of the nanocarrier [280]. The physical forces associated with cavitation destabilize the nanocarrier structure, increasing drug release (Fig. 11I). Low-frequency ultrasonic waves perform better with lipid rupture, and do not impair chemical properties and drug activity [289,290]. Other related nanocarriers include bio-erodible polymers as drug carriers, which with exposure to ultrasound can increase polymer erosion and increase drug release. Ultrasound, for example, increases the swelling of poly ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) matrices, thereby boosting the release rate of swollen matrices 30–500 times [291]. Swollen matrices are interesting candidates for drug delivery.\nAcoustic microbubbles have also been widely used as carriers, and are one of the most suitable ultrasound-responsive carriers [292]. This group of carriers consists of a gas core like nitrogen and air, as well as its shell, consisting of lipids, polymers, and proteins such as albumin. Microbubbles are usually 1–10 μm in diameter and remain in circulation after infusion if they are not phagocytosed. Ultrasound causes changes in their physiological properties, which increases the penetration of drug into cells [293,294]. Microbubbles in more complex structures consist of several layers of fluid and elastic, each layer having different properties such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity [295]. Under the proper sound pressure, microbubbles oscillate rapidly, eventually collapsing. Shear stress from microbubbles can cause transient cleavage in the cell membrane and increase the pore size, thus enhancing the EPR effect, in a phenomena called ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction [296]. However, microbubbles are short lived\nand have poor extravasation, both of which limit their use. This problem has been remedied by the development of perfluorocarbon nanocarriers that undergo ultrasound conversion into microbubbles (Fig. 11II) [297]. In spite of many investigations on US for drug delivery, it is still hard to be quantitatively accurate regarding US parameters, often because various US strategies use several frequencies and materials."

      "text" : "Magnetic fields are another important stimulus in DDS. Since they have only limited physical interaction with the patient's body, they are considered to be the safest type of stimulus. Magnetic fields may be used to prompt the release of a drug or to conduct nanoparticles responsive to the tumor (Fig. 12I) [298]. Magnetic nanoparticles are mainly consist of a magnetic core coated with organic or inorganic materials and are attached to targeting ligands by organic linkers (Fig. 12II). Their preparation is described schematically in Fig. 12III. In the bio-heat equation mentioned, one of the delegates in the energy deposition due to stimuli (Qext) is the magnetic field. The heat generated by such a field is due to the dynamic response of a dipole with its magnetic moments, as described in the following Eq. [299]:\nµ x f H f\" ( )\nMNPs\nMNPs\n0 2\nThe specific loss power needed to determine the amount of electromagnetic energy\nThe ratio of the mass of MNPs and the volume of magnetic fluid (25)\nςMNPs: concentration of MNPs, f: magnetic field frequency, H: magnetic field strength, ρMNPs: MNP density,\n∅: MNPs volume fraction, μ0: permeability of free space, x\": imaginary part of the susceptibility. When sensitive magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are placed in an alternating magnetic field (AMF) due to intrinsic rotational motion (Brownian) and extrinsic motion (Neel), the result is heat generation and pulsatile release profile propagation (Fig. 12IV). This type of hyperthermia depends on various factors, such as hysteresis coercivity and saturation magnetization, both of which are related to the MNPs’ size [300]. This phenomenon involving the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles is an interesting mechanism for drug release. The common magnetic carriers that are responsive to magnetic fields are lipids [301] and polymers [301], which can serve as coating materials for MNPs and release drugs in response to a magnetically induced temperature enhancement [302]. The mechanism of release in the presence of an AMF is a change in the nanocarriers’ structure that increases the nanocarrier shell's porosity [303], disintegrates the magneto-liposome (Fe3O4) core [304], or deforms the single-crystal nanoshell lattice [305]. Liposomes are very important because of the increased permeability that occurs at roughly the melting temperature of liposomes' membrane. The melting temperature depends on the lipid composition, which can be sensitive to body temperature. As the temperature rises slightly above the normal body temperature, the drug is released [306,307]. In polymers where the drug molecules and magnetic beads are dispensed in a polymer matrix, in presence of AMF, the drug is released at high speed. The two parameters influencing the release of these systems are the magnetic field features and the mechanical characteristics of the polymer matrix [308]. The force driving nanoparticle movement in the bloodstream is the drag force of the blood, which is greater in the middle of blood vessels than near their walls.\nMagnetic fields offer marked potential to overcome this drag and help the accumulation of magnetic nanocarriers. Depending on the strength of the magnetic field, particles may accumulate on the vessel wall or be redirected near to the location of the magnet and increasing the penetration (Fig. 12V) [309,310]. These effects reduce side effects and result in an accumulation of nanocarriers in the tumor tissue, in turn boosting the EPR effect that has shown great potential in cancer treatment."

Polymers, hydrogels, metal nanoparticles, and nanocomposites are electrically responsive carriers, and the rate of delivery of drugs is based on the applied field and conductive materials [155]. The electrical responsiveness depends on various parameters such as charge density, electrolyte concentration, hydrophobicity of nanoparticle, pH, and the composition of the aqueous medium [314]. Polyelectrolytes are a type of polymers with a large concentration of ionized groups along the backbone. This feature causes swelling or shrinkage of nanocarriers due to changes in pH caused by the electrochemical reaction [315]. In some cases, the electric field causes carrier erosion (Fig. 13I). For example, nano-gel can be transformed from solid state to solution by a pH-induced change of electrical stimulation through the breakdown of hydrogen bonds, and so release their loads [316,317]. Gel degradation occurs through surface erosion, and can be designed to follow zero-order kinetics [314]. Changes in the hydrogel depend on factors such as changes in the osmotic pressure and applied voltage; differences in the shape and thickness of the gel; and the position of the gel relative to the electrodes. The amount of drug released\nin response to the electric field is related to the loss of gel mass [318,319]. Electrical stimulation can also break electrostatic bonds or reducible bonds and so release therapeutic agents [320]. Carbon nanotubes [321] and polymeric biodegradable microchips [322] contain nano-sized drug reservoirs that can deliver controlled drug delivery over long periods of time by electrically opening the caps of these reservoirs at timed intervals. Among the applications and functions mentioned for this approach is the use of transmembrane voltage. It allows an efficient pathway for electromagnetic drug delivery by creating pores in the cell membrane, thereby increasing their permeability to drugs. An interesting study has been performed on the release of fluorescein from hydrogels. Evaluation of fluorescein released in the presence of the electric field from hydrogel was performed over a 30 min period that is repeated every 5 min. If the adjusted voltage between two electrodes becomes a − 1.5 V, a 60 ng of fluorescein is released. At each repetition period, the release rate decreased by approximately 20 ng, which may be related to the amount of fluorescein remaining in the hydrogel. When the voltage between the two electrodes is +0.5 V, the fluorescein release is 25 ng, which decreases in accordance with the previous result in subsequent iterations (Fig. 13II) [323]."

      "text" : "Light-responsive DDSs are very attractive to researchers due to their potential for remote control and high-spatiotemporal resolution [324]. Light is used at different wavelengths, such as ultraviolet [325], visible [326], and near-infrared [327], that shown in Fig. 14I. The major forms of light-based DDSs are distinguishable by their depths of penetration. For example, the UV and visible ranges for drug release are suitable for sites that are in direct contact with light, such as the eyes and skin. Because of the radiation of wavelengths below 700 nm, they are not able to penetrate tissue because of the strong absorption of the main tissue chromophores such as melanin, hemoglobin, and myoglobin [328,329]. However, in the infrared range (650–900 nm), the penetration is deeper and is effective for deep tissue therapy. Increasing the wavelength of the beam beyond 900 nm produces low tissue penetration because of the absorption of light by water [330]. Three\nmechanisms for drug release from NIR-responsive systems have been proposed: (1) photo-thermal effect, (2) two-photon activation, and (3) upconverting nanoparticles (Fig. 14II) [157]. A variety of organic and inorganic nanoparticles that respond to light have been introduced (Fig. 14III). Heat-induced photo-thermal effect generation is defined as the term Qex in the bio-heat equation, as represented in Eq. 27 [331]. µt (27)\nμt: absorption coefficient of the tissue, φ: local energy distribution (the light fluence rate). The resulting heat can lead to structural changes in TSLs and polymers, in other words, drug release by phase transfer and degradation [16]. The resulting heat can also lead to plasmonic nanobubbles and acts similar to drug release by ultrasound [332]. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) isomerizes the photosensitizers (e.g., azobenzene) located on the fluorophores in the nanostructure, thereby activating the drug-release process [333]. The upconverting nanoparticle can be excited via lasers with continuous-wave NIR irradiation, as opposed to two-photon excitation, which requires very short-pulsed lasers [164]. Two-photon excitation, through the production of toxic\nROS under two-photon irradiation, shows significant toxicity to cancer cells [334]. UV can also be used to stimulate nanoparticles to release drugs; the high energy of each photon from UV light results in ionization and breakdown of covalent bonds. This process produces more energy per photon than visible light, so it is more capable of breaking through chemical bonds. There are, however, potential risks, such as tissue damage and high cytotoxicity, and disruption of molecular activity [335]. The penetration depth is low, so this approach has had only limited medical application. However, the problem has been partially resolved by two-photon absorption (TPA) and upconverting of nanoparticles. In TPA, two-photons in the NIR range (equivalent to a single UV photon) are absorbed by either two-photon NIR sensitive material or a UV sensitive material to achieve the favorable result [336]."

It also\nincreases the half-life of drugs at the target site [336]. These responsive DDSs combine endogenous or exogenous stimuli, or both, to improve therapeutic effects by minimizing undesired release in healthy tissues [157]. Despite the good performance and precise release of these systems, they often look complex and are not yet fully understood. Among existing systems responsive to multi-stimuli are Dual thermo/pH responsive [337], Dual redox/pH responsive [338], Dual magnetic/pH responsive [339], Dual enzyme/pH responsive [340], Dual photo/pH responsive [341], Dual NIR/Redox responsive [342], Dual Magnetics field/Redox responsive [343], Dual magnetic/photo [344], Multi temperature/pH/redox-responsive [345], Multi pH/redox/photo-responsive [346] and Multi thermal/pH/redox-responsive [347]. In a study of laser and redox responsive systems after 72 h at pH 7.4, the drug release rate was 99.35%, whereas in the presence of NIR and redox alone the release rates were 73.46% and 58.40%, respectively. Reducing the pH to 5.5 had no significant effect on release rate [342]. Hydrogels composed of P (N-isopropylacrylamide-N,N’-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate [NIPAM-DMAEMA]) (PND) can respond to three stimuli at the same time: redox, temperature, and pH. For example, PNIPAM is sensitive to temperature, so drugs are released by temperature enhancement. DMAEMA facilitates release responding to an acidic pH. PND provided with a disulfide cleavable bond in the existence of a reducing medium produces faster release of encapsulated drugs [347]. The combination of NIR with pH and GSH results in greater erosion [348]."

      "heading" : "6. Cancer cell targeting by programmed nanocarrier",
      "text" : "EPR effect is one of the unique features of the tumor, which is a prerequisite for other targeted drug delivery strategies. Although the EPR effect causes nanoparticles to accumulate in tumor tissue, the ultimate goal of nanoparticles is achieved when they enter the cancer cell,\nand then drug release happens. Many anticancer drugs, such as Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin, affect intracellular targets, such as microtubules and DNA [349,350]. Therefore, according to Section 4.2, embedding the ligand on the surface of nanocarrier to increase the chances of internalization is necessary. However, the non-targeted connection is a major problem and may cause harmful side effects. Programmed targeting strategy to reduce the side effects of active targeting along with enhanced stability and circulation, which promises to have a high potential of enhancing internalization, is stimulus-responsive nanocarriers. In fact, transformable nanocarrier responds to external or internal stimuli and transforms into a cell-interactive, that be able to enhance cellular internalization [351]. In this group of advanced nanocarriers, the responsive agent can be a ligand embedded in the carrier surface or it can be part of a responsive carrier. Accordingly, pH-responsive peptides have a special ability known as pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP). They are water-soluble in neutral pH and become highly hydrophobic after entering the acidic environment of the tumor, due to the two aspartic protease residues in the transmembrane region of pHLIP that are protonated. This causes the pHLIP to become a rigid transmembrane α-helix that spontaneously crosses the membrane and enters the cancer cell [352,353].\nStealth ligands are another attractive strategy that reduces nonspecific binding, that is exposed in response to stimuli. For example, small molecules are hidden in the inner layer of the carrier. After the carrier reaches the tumor site and is exposed to a specific stimulus, it responds and the layer is destroyed, causing the ligand to be exposed [354]. Sheddable PEG coatings make the nanocarrier more stable and have a prolonged circulation time. Long PEG chains protect ligands such as folate and peptides against plasma proteins. Relying on the EPR effect, the nanocarrier accumulates in the tumor and under a special stimulus, the PEG coating is removed at the tumor site to activate target ligands and then bind to receptors on the cancer cell surface and\nconsequently then internalization begins [355–357]. The use of degradable coatings and their degradation by enzymes is another attractive strategy that can protect targeted ligands to prevent nonspecific uptake [358,359]. Another attractive way to hide target ligands is to hide them in the inner layer of the nanocarrier, which is transferred to the nanocarrier surface after responding to the stimulus. Then, an internalization operation begins, in which the payload is released in the intracellular environment in response to the same type of stimulus or another stimulus [360]."

      "text" : "In the field of nano-based DDS development, major challenges remaining in the formulation design, drug release kinetics, product identity verification, and safety issues, and must be overcome if nanocarriers are to be successfully translated into clinical environments [361,362]. Promising results have been obtained from pre-clinical studies but may not be applicable to clinical settings. An important feature of promising clinical nanoparticles is their simple formula, but achieving smart properties requires advanced features and structures, which are very difficult to scale for industrial production. The main barrier to clinical trials is the unwillingness of pharmaceutical companies to invest in nanomedicine, which requires focusing on important factors associated with DDSs [363]. The development of more-efficient nano-based DDSs should be based on common interdisciplinary approaches, especially computational modeling. Computational modeling\nis crucial in exploring the design principles of linkers in nanoparticle structure that will achieve optimal release profiles and ultimately new treatments. Computational modeling can also be used to solve analytical problems and gain comprehensive knowledge of the interaction of biological systems with drug carriers that can estimate the stage of a disease by estimating nanoparticle accumulation in tumors. In addition, evaluation of intertumoral nanocarrier behavior through computational modeling allows for accurate prediction of treatment, with fewer concerns about time and cost than other pre-clinical tests raise [364,365]. Computational models are defined from raw data extracted from the patient's biological condition. According to these conditions, these models provide solutions to improve treatment methods. However, translating results from computational models to the clinic faces various limitations because most of these models have little resemblance to the complexity and heterogeneity of clinical tumors. For example, nanoparticle accumulation is exaggerated due to the EPR effect rather than mimicking clinical distribution [366]. Unfortunately, the lack of degradability or inadequate biocompatibility of stimuli-responsive systems has limited the chances of these systems reaching clinical practice. The strengths of these systems esensitivity to discrete changes of temperature, redox or pH potentiale are not easy to exploit, and issues regarding the penetration depth of the external stimulus must also be solved. It is hard to determine which stimuli-responsive nano-systems have the best chance of proceeding to clinical use. Many optimizations and enhancement trials are needed to translate the stimuli from the experimental models to clinical ones, especially for endogenous stimuli,\nwhich are difficult to control because there are tremendous variations from patient to patient. However, the control of exogenous stimuli is much easier and promising for clinical cases once problems such as damage to normal tissue and depth of penetration have been overcome [16]. Therefore, more attention needs to be given to developing advanced approaches that can best deliver control and release profiles.\nCreating a new clinical line and understanding specific challenges to safety standards such as toxicity or inappropriate PK profile prior to project implementation are critical. Translation from the preclinical to the clinical should provide complete insight into the effective parameters of nano-carriers, such as drug release rates and release profiles. To advance this form of treatment, DDS researchers need to create a set of translatable data that includes (1) the intra-tumor carrier-retention rate, drug release rate, drug metabolism and carrier destruction over time; (2) the differentiation of drug concentration in the whole tumor, other organs, and plasma; (3) PK evaluation and biological distribution; (4) a clear focus on clinical end-use; and (5) proper dosages and treatment schedules [366,367]. Access to this data set can only be achieved through strategic partnerships that, once research is completed and the results extracted, deliver the data to clinicians. Focusing on the end clinical application and developing a complete understanding of the fringe of DDSs should significantly improve translation, but it should be stressed that achieving optimal translation and treatment requires investment. The previous sections discussed innovations for DDSs with various profiles of release. Each of these technologies can provide only one type of drug with a specific release type. The ideal situation would be a customizable single platform for carrying pharmaceuticals that provides specific release options. The biological characteristics of each individual, such as age, sex, size, and genome, must be taken into account in personalized medicine [322,368]. Although it is well known that every person's medical needs are different, meeting the wide range of needs is challenging at the moment. The next section deals with microchip technology that allows drugs to be released using customizable prescriptions.\nThe use of microchips is one possible way to control drug-release profiles. A microchip is a device that has multiple small reservoirs surrounded by polymer membranes for drug release control [369]. The characteristics of PLGA such as long degradation time and biocompatibility make it the preferred material for creating the membrane. By sealing the reservoirs with four types of PLGA, drugs can be released with four different pulses [369]. Recently, an advanced microchip has been introduced that can control the release of medication either wirelessly or in a programmed manner. Release occurs immediately following the operator's instructions [370,371]. In this design, thin metal membranes are used instead of polymer ones, which is very useful for cancer patients who require repeated drug administration. By embedding these microchips in vivo, release can be defined automatically for a duration of several months, so patients can benefit from the technology without any effort."

      "text" : "Pharmaceutical nanocarriers are particularly important in the design of DDSs, due to their having a greater surface area to volume ratio, which can enhance biodistribution and PKs. This study has focused exclusively on the introduction and operation of DDSs, to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the function of drug release profiles from carriers with respect to the underlying mechanisms, inspired by mathematical models. Although many efforts have been made to understand the performance of DDSs, uncertainties remain, and we use computational models here to address these ambiguities. EPR effect has been clarified through the use of mathematical models. Active targeting has also been introduced, with an explanation of how it can be used to modify nanocarrier surfaces with targeted ligands to make nanocarriers more efficient. Next, stimuli-responsive systems based on pathophysiological or external sources were described, plus their role in\nminimizing side effects on normal tissues. The methods of drug release with this group, swelling or erosion, are particular promising, having minimal side effects and maximum treatment efficacy, simultaneously.\nThe use of redox and enzyme stimuli still requires much investigation. Light-based stimuli use is restricted firstly to superficial lesions unless fiber optics or NIR can be used. The biggest problems with these DDSs lie with their instability, toxicity, shallow depth of penetration, and the need for precise emission control in response to the stimulus signal. Transforming these currently undeliverable methods into valid cancer treatment options is one of the future goals for nanomedicine. Precision control can be achieved by employing multi-stimulant DDSs. One new approach for controlling release, reversible stimuli-responsive DDSs with on-off switching, is an important step in the development of DDSs with reduced side effects. Compared to the earlier ones, these systems allow spatiotemporal controlled drug release that will allow where, when, and for how long a drug is released. Additionally, on-off switching ability allows dose adjustment according to a patient's need. New approaches are also required to overcome the problems of passive targeting (limitations on nanoparticle accumulation), active targeting (problems with immune detection and scale production), and stimulusresponsiveness to the efficiency of treatment responses. We are confident that the incorporation of targeted ligands on the surface of multi reversible stimuli-responsive nanocarriers will prove a viable and unique DDS for controlled drug release, especially for MDR cancers. However, we anticipate that future studies will focus on combining therapeutic and diagnostic systems.\nMultifunctional targeted theranostic nanoparticles are being developed that usefully combine two elements: diagnosis and treatment. In fact, concurrent delivery and diagnosis enable cancer treatment and monitoring in parallel, a crucial development for realizing personalized medicine. Theranostics for noninvasive screening of cancer during treatment reveals the actual characteristics of cancer and its side effects in each patient, and so can identify emerging conditions that may respond positively to treatment. Initial feedback on treatment side effects gives important insights into heterogeneities, both within tumors and between patients, enabling better cancer management, and thus improving the possibility of remission. Although nanoparticle-mediated combination therapies are still under development, they have the potential to become the next generation of cancer treatment. Despite the development of different therapies, it is important to add a propulsion that will actually drive the nanoparticles toward the tumor. The most important propulsion that will be of greater interest in the future are bacteria. Indeed, bacteria use their mobility to survive and move to desirable environments. These characteristics of bacteria can overcome many of the biological barriers that nanocarriers face. A unique set of nutrients eserine, aspartate, ribose, leucine, and argininee, which are metabolically secreted in the tumor microenvironment, attracts bacteria, which in turn increases the accumulation of bacteria in the tumor tissue and facilitates penetration into cancer cells. This issue should be further addressed in the future as loading nanoparticles in the bacteria becomes more prominent.\nImproved treatment efficacy has been under consideration for decades, whereas toxicity reduction in the development of cancer nanomedicines has not yet been specifically addressed. When the toxicity of anticancer drugs is manipulated through nanomedicine (i.e., a focus on decreasing toxicity without compromising efficacy), it introduces new directions for cancer treatment and also provides better opportunities for translation. There is hope in the context of research that new pharmaceutical nanomedicine can modify current cancer therapies. In addition, given the growing role of cancer immunotherapy, it is unlikely that the newest research target will be the immune system."

Novel endogenous-based and exogenous-based stimulusresponsive drug delivery systems have been proposed to prevent the cancer progression with proper drug delivery. To control effective dose loading and sustained release, targeted permeability and individual variability can now be described in more-complex ways, such as by combining internal and external stimuli. Despite these advances in release control, certain challenges remain and are identified in this research, which emphasizes the control of drug release and applications of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Using a multiscale and multidisciplinary approach, this study investigates and analyzes drug delivery and release strategies in the nanoparticle-based treatment of cancer, both mathematically and clinically.",
