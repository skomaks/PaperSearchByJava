      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Despite the tremendous technological advances of the modern era, our world is still threatened by the problem of energy dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels. Many governments and scientists are promoting a move away from non-renewable to renewable energy sources. In this aspect, hydrogen is supposed to be the potential alternative for the future energy supply provided that it is harnessed through spotless way [1–7]. Splitting water molecules (H2O (l) → H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g), ΔG0 =+ 237.2 kJmol−1) for pure hydrogen gas has been thought as a clean and environmentally friendly route leading to profound transformations. Several substantial techniques, such as water-alkali [8–10] or proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers [11–13], solar water splitting devices [14,15], have been designed to produce pure hydrogen gas. In particular, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred on cathode in electrolytic bath provides pure H2 gas. But, this reaction generally depends on the considerable electrocatalysts due to the high overpotential needed in the process [16–18]. The utilization of electrocatalysts could accelerate the reaction kinetics and lower energy barrier of water dissociation, thereby decreasing the overpotential.\nHence, efficient and potent electrocatalysts have to be sought to generate pure hydrogen gas via water splitting in solution of interest. To date, a variety of noble-metal free electrocatalysts have been extensively studied to electro-catalyze water splitting. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially, have attracted copious attention for fundamental research and practical application [19–23]. Of particular note is that the typical TMDs, i.e., MoS2, has been extensively explored as an earth abundant candidate with high expectation to replace noble metals following theoretical and experimental proves [24,25]. Meanwhile, there are lots of reviews communicated so far to summarize the trends in MoS2 and the rest TMDs [19–21,26-28]. It can be noted that numerous efforts, e.g., increasing edge sites [24,29,30], tuning phase [31–33], engineering defect [34–37] and introducing strain [38–40], have been made in an attempt to improve the electrocatalytic activity of TMD nanocatalysts. As a result, high overpotentials (> 150mV) [19–21,26,41–43] to obtain the current density of 10mA cm−2 in the HER process are usually observed on the TMD electrocatalysts, signifying that these materials still could not outperform the benchmark precious metals (e.g., Pt, Ru, Pd etc.).\nApart from TMDs, other noble metal-free compounds, including\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.017 Received 4 December 2018; Received in revised form 24 December 2018; Accepted 5 January 2019\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

Given their activity in hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process [44,45], where the binding of hydrogen ion regulates, these compounds are deemed to be the new earth-abundant HER catalysts. Fig. 1 demonstrates the timeline of first reported HER activities on various compounds. The hydrogen evolution was firstly realized with the assistance of nickel metal in alkaline solution [46]. Through time, other noble metal-free electrocatalysts were found to be active for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction. Until now, these materials are widely used as catalyst to split water for H2 gas and the catalytic mechanism has gradually become uncovered. Significant researches were carried out in the last few years (Fig. 2) driven by the demand for designing efficient HER electrocatalysts in acidic, alkaline and neutral solutions. In 1995, I. Paseka et al. reported that the amorphous NiPx layers with 3 wt% phosphorus demonstrated considerable HER activity in KOH solution [47]. After ten years, density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated the [NiFe] hydrogenaselike behavior of Ni2P crystal, predicting it to be a potential HER catalyst [48]. More importantly, A. B. Laursen et al. reported crystalline Ni5P4 microparticles to be a superior HER elecrocatalyst, showing a small overpotential of 23 mV at 10mA cm−2 with Tafel slope of 33mV dec−1\nin strong acidic media [49]. Besides metal phosphides, the metal carbides or nitrides are also utilized as HER electrocatalysts in all-pH electrolytes [50–54]. The electronic structure of these compounds, usually referred to as interstitial alloys, is easily modified by the incorporation of C and N atoms. In 1974, tungsten carbide, i.e., WC, was found to show the platinum-like catalytic activity [55,56]. The\ncontribution of valence electrons from carbon to the 5d band of tungsten would give rise to increase in the width of unfilled portion on d band, resulting in a similar electronic structure to that of Pt [57]. This material has been proved to be an efficient cathode catalyst to generate hydrogen gas in conventional PEM and microbial electrolyzers [58,59]. And the Mo-based carbides (e.g., Mo2C [51,60–62]) and nitrides (e.g., MoN [63–66]) have attracted substantial interest as HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, metal oxides and borides have also won attention in various research groups to electrocatalyze water splitting [67–71]. Notably, some earth-abundant metal alloys, like NiMo [72–74], FeCo [75,76], have been designed and reported to exhibit high HER catalytic activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Given the tremendous achievements on the noble metal-free electrocatalysts beyond TMDs, this research area has gone through considerable developments deserving a comprehensive outlook and plausible forecasts. To the best of our knowledge, there is, hitherto, no relevant analysis to systematically compare the performances and summarize the trends in the HER catalytic activities of these electrocatalysts. In this review, we start with introducing the mechanism of HER, the parameters to evaluate the HER performance and factors considered to design efficient HER electrocatalysts. Then, the recent developments in the area of non-noble metal electrocatalysts, including transition metal phosphides (TMPs), transition metal carbides (TMCs) and transition metal nitrides (TMNs), etc., are summarized. And the synthesis routes of these materials are highlighted. Specially, we review several potentially practical electrocatalysts (i.e., NiPx, MoCx and NiMo alloys) utilized to electrocatalyze water splitting. Some strategies like heteroatom doping,\nnanostructuring, constructing heterostructures etc. to optimize the HER efficiencies are also discussed. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of these materials are stressed."

      "heading" : "2.1. Electrocatalytic mechanism of HER",
      "text" : "Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is the cathodic half reaction of water electrolysis, has been one of the most thoroughly studied electrochemical reactions, recently. It generally contains two successive electrochemical steps as has been confirmed from the mechanisms studied on Pt-based electrocatalysts (Fig. 3) [77,78]. During the first step, i.e., Volmer reaction, the external circuit provides an electron coupling with a proton adsorbed on the surface of the electrocatalyst, to yield an adsorbed hydrogen atom (Hads) intermediate. Volmer reaction is then followed by either a combination of two hydrogen atoms (Tafel reaction) or combination of an adsorbed hydrogen atom with a proton and an electron (Heyrovsky reaction). From the perspective of HER mechanism, the adsorbed protons vary with the electrolyte and play a vital role. In acidic media (e.g., H2SO4), protons exist in the form of hydronium ions (H3O+), while water molecules (H2O) act as the proton source in alkaline (e.g., KOH) or neutral media (e.g., phosphate buffer electrolyte) (Table 1). Plethora of studies have been reported to reveal the intrinsic electrochemical activities and electronic structures of the electrocatalysts, which are closely related to their reaction pathways [79–82]."

      "heading" : "2.2. Parameters for evaluating electrocatalysts",
      "text" : "Numerous parameters have been used elsewhere to evaluate how effective a given catalyst is. Deep understanding of these parameters is essential to design an active, efficient and robust catalyst. In the following section, the physicochemical meaning and interpretation of some commonly employed parameters are elaborated in the context of HER.\n(i) Gibbs free energy and overpotential The electrochemical adsorption and desorption of hydrogen atoms on the electrocatalyst surface is a pair of competitive reaction in\nnature. An optimal HER catalyst should adsorb H atoms neither too weakly nor too strongly on its surface. According to the Sabatier principle [83], a desired HER electrocatalyst should exhibit the ideal trade-off between the binding and releasing of the Hads intermediate. The moderate bonding strength of the electrocatalyst to Hads intermediate not only facilitate the charge/mass transfer but also assure a facile bond breaking and rapidly release of hydrogen molecules [84]. Unfortunately, the establishment of quantitative relationships between the energetics of the Hads intermediate and the electrochemical hydrogen generation reaction rate is difficult due to the lack of direct measurement of values for the Hads bonding energy. As a result, the calculated Gibbs free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*) can be used as a crucial descriptor to evaluate the catalytic activity of the HER catalysts [80,85–89]. As guided by the volcano plot in which the experimental j0 as a function of the DFT-calculated ΔGH* (Fig. 4) [87], the ΔGH* of optimal catalyst should approach to thermoneutral (e.g., ΔGH* ≈ 0), the electrochemical hydrogen production will have the maximum reaction rate under this condition. Therefore, the ΔGH* can act as an important reference for screening and theoretical prediction of superior HER catalysts. In fact, there is no electrochemical reaction that occurs at the potential predicted only by thermodynamic considerations excluding the kinetic hindrances experienced in a real system. Thus, the actual potential where reaction takes place is different from Nernstian potential and the difference between the two potentials corresponds to overpotential (η) [80]. There are three plausible sources for the rise of overpotential, viz., activation overpotential, concentration overpotential and uncompensated resistance overpotential which is exerted by the electrochemical interfaces. The activation overpotential is an intrinsic property of the catalyst and varies from one material to another. Hence, it can be minimized by choosing an efficient catalyst. The concentration overpotential occurs as soon as the electrode reaction begins as a result of the sudden drop in concentration near the interfaces. This can be minimized by homogenizing the electrolyte through stirring the solution. The resistance overpotential can be minimized by conducting Ohmic drop compensation. This option is now available in many modern electrochemical workstations that are equipped to automatically compensate for iR loss. Experimentally, the value of\noverpotential at specified current density is utilized to evaluate the performance of electrocatalysts. In a typical electrocatalysis, the most significant point is the issue of how much current do the catalyst achieve for the amount of overpotential that is applied. For ease of quantifying the overpotential, two parameters, i.e., onset overpotential and overpotential at current density of 10mA cm−2\n(η10) are frequently utilized as figure of merits. Onset overpotential is the extra potential at which the current density starts to increase remarkably [20,90,91]. The η10 corresponds to the commercially equivalent photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency of 12.3%, which is regarded as an important criterion. A high-efficiency electrocatalyst should exhibit a low overpotential when electrochemically generating hydrogen gas.\n(ii) Tafel slope and exchange current density The Tafel equation (Eq. (1)) is an extremely important formula in electrochemical reactions and is usually used to reveal the relationship between steady-state current density and overpotential [87,92]. From this equation, one can obtain two important parameters, Tafel slope (b) and exchange current density (j0). Tafel slope is usually used as an indication to discern the charge transfer kinetic of the hydrogen evolution process [93]. In fact, it can be theoretically derived from the Butler-Volmer equation (Eq. (2)) [92]. When the overpotential is high (η > 50mV), the ButlerVolmer equation can be simplified as Eq. (3).\n= +η a b log j (1)\n= − + − −j j e e[ ]0 αnFη RT α nFη RT/ (1 ) / (2)\n= + = +η a b j RT αnF j RT αnF jlog -2.3 log 2.3 log0 (3)\nVolmer reaction:\n=b RT αF 2.3 1 (4)\nHeyrovsky reaction:\n=\n+ b RT α F 2.3 (1 )2 (5)\nTafel reaction:\n=b RT F 2.3 23 (6)\nWhere α is the charge transfer coefficient, n is the number of electrons transferred, F (96485Cmol−1) is the Faraday constant, R (8.314 Jmol−1 C−1) is the ideal gas constant, and T (K) is the absolute temperature. From the Tafel slope analysis in the ButlerVolmer kinetic model, it can be deduced that each reaction intermediate of the hypothesis could be a rate-determining step [77]. At 298 K, the Tafel slopes of the above mentioned three reactions are calculated to be b1 ≈ 120mV dec−1, b2 ≈ 40mV dec−1, and b3 ≈ 30mV dec−1, respectively. This means that when the value of b is close to 120mV dec−1 (Eq. (4)), Volmer reaction is a rate-determining step, and the electrochemical adsorption reaction of hydrogen atoms on the electrocatalyst surface is sluggish. If the value of Tafel slope approaches to 40mV dec−1 (Eq. (5)), Heyrovsky reaction is the rate-determining step. In this case, the electrochemical adsorption reactions of hydrogen atoms occur easily, and the generation of hydrogen molecules is mainly governed by electrochemical desorption. If the value of Tafel slope is about 30mV dec−1 (Eq. (6)), obtained on commercial Pt/C, the combination of adsorbed hydrogen atom and desorption of hydrogen molecules will be limiting steps. Based on the above discussion, one can refer to the value of Tafel slope to infer the hydrogen generation pathway. In addition, the exchange current density (j0) is another key descriptor to estimate the intrinsic reactivity of the electrocatalysts under equilibrium conditions. It is valued with the overpotential of zero, which profoundly depends on the reaction activation energy at the surface of the electrocatalyst [80,87]. The j0 is comparable to the rate constants used in heterogeneous electrocatalysis, it is governed by both kinetics and thermodynamics. Usually, it assumes a very low value due to the unavailability of net current at equilibrium signifying the extent of oxidation or reduction that may occur. The intrinsic property of electrocatalyst materials, electrolyte composition and temperature will influence the value of j0 [92]. It can be calculated by extrapolating the linear part of Tafel plots. A desirable electrocatalyst should possess a small Tafel slop (b) and a high exchange current density (j0) simultaneously. (iii) Faradic efficiency and stability Faradic efficiency (FE), also called columbic efficiency, is an importantly technical and economic index in electrochemical reactions. It describes the proportion of electrons participating in the desired reaction versus total electrons supplied via external circuit in the desired reaction. In HER process, Faradic efficiency is defined as the ratio of the experimentally detected amount of hydrogen gas versus theoretically generated hydrogen gas [20,91]. The actual amount of hydrogen produced can be measured by gas chromatography (GC), and the theoretical hydrogen production can be calculated by integrating galvanostatic or potentiostatic electrolysis plot. However, due to the presence of side reactions on the electrode surface, the utilization efficiency of electrons is usually less than 100%. Besides, long-term stability is also a crucial parameter to evaluate the performance of HER electrocatalysts. The robust catalysts could be potentially used in the practical application. Typically, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic or potentiostatic results are collected to judge the stability of the electrocatalysts. The negligible variation of the CV cycles and polarization curve obtained before and after long-term (>dozens of hours) measurement indicates the good durability.\n(iv) Electrochemical active surface area and turnover frequency\nWith the advent of the nanotechnology era, the exploration of nanocatalysts has gone through significant advancements. When the\nmaterials are brought from bulk to nanoscale, the atoms are maximally exposed to the surface thereby leading to the ease-accessibility of active sites to bind the incoming intermediates/reactants. Hence, the increasing surface-to-volume ratio with decreasing particle size strongly increases the specific catalytic activity as a result of the large specific surface area. In connection to this, estimation of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is particularly important for evaluating the performance of the catalyst. One of the most commonly employed ECSA estimation methods is measuring cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the nonfaradaic regions [93]. When performing the CV test, the non-faradaic current density (j) should be linearly related to scan rate (v) in such a way that the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) can be derived from the slope (Eq. (7)). After normalizing the double layer capacitance with the double layer capacitance of a flat surface, roughness factor (RF) can be estimated from Eq. (8). Given the value of the roughness factor, multiplying it with density of active sites on flat surface yields density of electrochemically active sites [87].\n=C j vdl (7)\n=RF C C dl\ndl−Ref (8)\nBesides, ECSA can also be estimated by underpotential deposition or carefully morphology characterization of the electrode via advanced electron microscopy [93]. It is worth noting that the chemical nature and preparation of the electrodes should be seriously considered when measuring the active surface area. For instance, some carbon-supported composites can result in overestimation of ECSA and underestimation of catalytic activity. In general, ECSA elucides information on the number of active sites of the electrocatalyst, but not all active sites are catalytically reactive. ECSA can still serve as an important reference for evaluation of catalyst performance.\nTo evaluate the efficiency of each active site on catalysts, turnover frequency (TOF) have to be considered [94]. TOF, representing the intrinsic activity of each active site, is defined as the number of desired reactions occurring at each active site per unit time. But, the measurement of TOF is challenging owing to the precise number of active sites per unit area is difficult to unequivocally elucidate. Especially for some emerging complex catalysts, the exact determination of the number of active site is difficult and hence various approximations are usually followed. Despite the fact that the calculated TOF is relatively imprecise, it may still give insights into the comparative catalytic activity or efficiency of different materials."

The earth-abundant transition metal based compounds arouse the attention of the researchers due to the cost-effective and specific electronic structure. Although plethora of experimental/theoretical reports and review articles have been communicated so far for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the recent research progress indicates that other types of transition metal compounds such as transition metal phosphides (TMPs), transition metal carbides (TMCs), transition metal nitrides (TMNs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), and transition metal borides (TMBs) have gone through considerable development in the electrocatalytic water splitting. These research arenas, therefore, deserves a comprehensive outlook and plausible forecasts. Here we review this aspect with particular attention is paid to the discussion of their classification, relationship between structure/composition and electrocatalytic activity and also strategies to improve the electrocatalytic performance of these materials for HER."

      "heading" : "3.1. Transition metal phosphides",
      "text" : "As the promising non-noble metal based electrocatalysts, transition metal phosphides (TMPs, TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo and W) have attracted a considerable interest recently. And they will likely be the candidate to replace the Pt-group nanomaterials for their highly efficient HER activities [95–99]. In 2005, inspired by the resemblance of biological pathway catalyzed by [NiFe] hydrogenase [48], Rodriguez et al. found that Ni2P(001) have an outstanding catalytic activity toward HER over the conventional Pt-group catalyst, which is ascribed to the crucial roles of P atoms for hydrogen production, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 5). The P sites could provide moderate bonding to the reaction intermediates involved in the HER [48]. The proton-acceptor of P site, along with the hydride-acceptor centers of Ni site, on the surface of Ni2P work in cooperative way to promote the hydrogen generation process. Of note, the electronic structure of TMPs is easily tuned via continuously doping P atom. Compared with metal (Ni, Co, Fe, etc.) atoms, P atoms usually possess the stronger electronegativity, resulting in withdrawing electrons from metal atoms. Thus, the positively charged protons are trapped on the P sites during the electrochemical hydrogen evolution [48,100]. From the previous studies [101,102], it is found that the increasing in atomic content of P for TMPs may effectively improve their HER activity within an appropriate range [49,101]. The excess P doping in TMPs crystals would restrict the delocalization of electrons around the metal atoms and gave rise to the decrease in the conductivity of the electrocatalyst, which severely hinders the charge transfer in the electrochemical hydrogen production [103,104]. Therefore, the appropriate ratio of P atoms should be seriously considered and controlled when utilizing the TMP crystals as catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen generation.\nIn the early times, the synthesis of almost all metal phosphides undergo high temperature or high pressure with flammable elemental phosphorus or noxious phosphine as the phosphorus source, which significantly hindered the developments and applications of TMPs. Until now, various methods have been developed to synthesize TMP nanomaterials. A variety of phosphorus sources, including organic phosphorus (e.g., trioctylphosphine [101,105]), inorganic phosphorus (e.g., hypophosphite [106,107], phosphate [100,108]), and elemental phosphorus (e.g., red phosphorus [109,110]) are utilized. It should be noted that the synthetic method of TMP nanomaterials is closely related to the selected phosphorus sources. Generally, organic phosphorus is used in wet-chemical method, and elemental phosphorus is used in high-temperature solid phase reaction. The detailed growth methods,\nclassified according to phosphorus source, will be discussed as follows.\n(i) Organic phosphorus: A versatile trioctylphosphine (TOP) is commonly used in wet-chemical method at the temperature above 300 °C [111–113]. The high boiling-point organic solvents (e.g., oleylamine, octadecene and squalene etc.) are utilized to ensure the\ncompletion of the reaction yielding metal phosphides. Typically, the C-P covalent bond in TOP molecular can easily be broken over 320 °C so that it can efficiently promote the reaction. For instance, highly dispersible, uniformly sized FeP [111], CoP [112] and Ni2P [113] nanoparticles were prepared by taking advantage of TOP as phosphorus sources to coordinate with metal atoms of metal\nNote: GCE, glassy carbon electrode; FTO, fluorine-doped tin oxide.\nacetylacetonates under thermal decomposition temperature. In this method, the phase, morphology and size of metal phosphide can be controlled by changing the reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature, solvent type and the ratio of phosphorus to metal [33,101]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this reaction is carried out only under rigorously air-free conditions due to the release of phosphorus which is highly corrosive and flammable.\n(ii) Inorganic phosphorus: This is another common phosphorus source for growing TMPs via chemical vapor reaction. Here, hypophosphite is made to pass through in situ pyrolysis to generate PH3 instead of directly using extremely noxious PH3 for solid-phase reaction. A simple operating procedure is to heat the mixture of metal precursors (e.g., metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal-\norganic frameworks) and hypophosphite (e.g., NH4H2PO2, NaH2PO2) over 300 °C under protective gas flow. More importantly, this hypophosphite-based reaction strategy can maximize the retention of precursors dimension and morphology. X. Sun’s group prepared FeP nanowire arrays [114], CoP/CNT nanohybrid [115] and WP2 submicroparticles [116] through this method with low-temperature hypophosphite reaction. In addition, phosphates (e.g., (NH4)2HPO4) are also used in the preparation of TMPs, especially molybdenum phosphides [100,108] and tungsten phosphides [116]. Briefly, a mixture of stoichiometric phosphate and polymolybdate or polytungstate is subjected to hydrothermal, calcination and annealing process in sequence.\n(iii) Elemental phosphorus: It is important to note that the advantage of using elemental phosphorus as a phosphorus source is the production of phosphorus-rich phosphides with high yield by tuning growth temperature and the metal/phosphorus ratio [109,117,118]. Usually, the chemical vapor reaction is utilized. For instance, the phosphorus-rich FeP2/C nanohybrids [117] and WP2 nanowire arrays [119] were synthesized via solid-phase phosphating reaction of red phosphorus.\nIn short, these three routes could be summarized with the following chemical reactions (9−13):\nRoute i (organic phosphorus):\n(C8H17)3P + M(acac)2 → MPx (9)\nRoute ii (inorganic phosphorus):\n2NaH2PO2 → Na2HPO4 + PH3 ↑ (10)\nPH3 + MyOz → MPx (11)\nor\n(NH4)2HPO4 + (NH4)6Mo7O2 →MPx (12)\nRoute iii (elemental phosphorus):\nP + M → MPx (13)\nGiven the similarity of metal phosphides and hydrogenase [48], many researchers around the world have contributed extensively to the advancement of this field, including the exploring various metal phosphides as efficient hydrogen evolution catalysts, developing improved method to prepare TMP nanomaterials, investigating their catalytic mechanisms, and demonstrating their applicability in integrated systems and devices [120]. Table 2 collects HER performance of various metal phosphide electrocatalysts under different conditions. In the subsequent subsection, the prominent roles and developments in research endeavors of frontier metal phosphides are discussed."

      "heading" : "3.1.1. Nickel phosphides",
      "text" : "The bio-inspired design of HER catalysts opened up a route to the\nwidespread investigation of nickel phosphide due to its resemblance with [NiFe] hydrogenase [48]. It is reported that the crystal structures of nickel phosphides can appear in several different phases with various atomic ratios of P: Ni (i.e., NiPx). And their electronic structure and physicochemical properties vary with composition and structure [120–122]. To date, nickel phosphides of a phosphorus-rich phase with x > 1 (e.g., NiP2 [123]) and metal-rich phases with x < 1 (e.g., Ni5P4 [49], Ni2P [113], Ni12P5 [124], and Ni3P [118]) have been reported to exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the HER (Fig. 6). In order to gain deep insight into the electrocatalytic activity of various NiPx nanocatalysts, numerous studies have been explored and conducted.\nIn 2014, X. Sun and co-workers successfully constructed NiP2 nanosheet arrays structure on carbon cloth (NiP2 NS) via hypophosphitebased reaction route (Route ii) (Fig. 6b) [123]. The as-prepared NiP2 NS\ndemonstrated superior HER performance with the overpotential required to produce cathodic current density of 10mA cm−2 (η10) and 100mA cm−2 (η100) is 75mV and 204mV in 0.5M H2SO4, respectively. The long-term electrocatalytic activity of NiP2 NS on carbon cloth is preserved for at least 57 h. Later, considering the outstanding conductivity of Ni5P4, Dismukes et al. synthesized Ni5P4 microparticles for generating H2 gas in both acidic and alkaline media [49]. As shown in the TEM image of micron-sized Ni5P4 in Fig. 6c, their size is around 0.3 ~ 1.8 µm. They exhibited exceptionally high HER activity, with a low overpotential of η10 = 23mV and a small Tafel slope of 33mV dec−1 in 1.0 M H2SO4, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, their HER activity with η10 = 49mV in alkaline media (1.0 M NaOH) also outperformed that of the analogous Ni2P nanocrystals. Note that, when decreasing the ratio of P (x < 1) atoms in nickel phosphides, the HER activity of NiPx is restricted. For instance, Schaak et al. utilized organic phosphine pyrolysis (Route i) to prepare Ni2P nanoparticles with hollow and multifaceted structure [113]. The Ni2P(001) crystal plane, on which theoretical calculation predicted the excellent electrocatalytic activity, was controlled and exposed in their work. As shown in Fig. 6d, the as-synthesized hollow Ni2P exhibited HER performance with the overpotential at 20mA cm−2 of 130mV. Likewise, C. Zhang et al. obtained crystalline Ni12P5 nanoparticles (Fig. 6e), showing the uniform size of 14 ± 2 nm [124]. Using these nanoparticles as electrocatalyst for HER in acidic media, the overpotential to generate the current density of 10mA cm−2 is around 107mV. The inferior HER activity was also observed on Ni3P microparticles (Fig. 6f) [118]. The comparison of HER activity on NiPx with different ratios were carefully studied by Liu et al [101]. The Ni5P4 crystals showed much more superior electrocatalytic activity than Ni12P5 and Ni2P for HER in 0.5M H2SO4 due to higher positive charge of Ni and a stronger ensemble effect of P in Ni5P4. Apart from the single-phase nickel phosphides mentioned above, the electrocatalytic properties of biphasic Ni5P4-Ni2P nanosheet arrays have been studied by Liu and co-workers (Fig. 6g) [104]. The biphasic Ni5P4-Ni2P nanosheet shows a low onset overpotential and excellent long-term durability in acidic solution."

      "text" : "As previously reported, metallic cobalt has been theoretically cal-\nculated to have low energy barriers for adsorbed hydrogen atoms [80,125], and therefore Co-based compounds are considered to be promising catalysts for HER. Cobalt phosphide (CoPx) [102,106,107,110,112,126–135], another important member of the TMP family, has been confirmed to be a highly active and acid-resistant electrocatalyst. Recently, the CoP crystals were extensively studied as catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution. It possesses MnP-type structure, in which the phosphorus atom is surrounded by six cobalt atoms to form a highly distorted triangular prism structure [112]. To date, various CoP nanocrystals with different morphologies, such as nanoparticle [112], nanowire [126] and nanosheet [127] have been designed and synthesized. As shown in Fig. 7a-b, Schaak’s group firstly prepared uniform CoP nanoparticles with an average particle size of 13 ± 2 nm through organic phosphorus route (Route i) [112]. These CoP nanoparticles supported on the Ti foil demonstrate well HER performance with overpotential of 85mV at the current density of 20mA cm−2 in 0.5M H2SO4. After that, the improved electrocatalytic activity was realized on the CoP nanowires (Fig. 7c-d) in the electrolyte with the pH range from 0 to 14 [126]. Inspired by the advantages, i.e., large surface area, appropriate structural distortion, abundant active sites and high proton/electron transfer efficiency, of two-dimensional (2D) materials [136], Zhang et al. designed and synthesized porous CoP nanosheets (Fig. 7e-f) with a two unit cell-thin thickness (1.1 nm) by phosphidation of Co3O4 precursors (Route ii) [127]. The as-prepared samples possess a high proportion of CoP (200) crystal face, which have been theoretically proved to be highly active toward the HER [39]. As expected, the porous CoP nanosheets exhibit superb electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential of η10 = 56mV and η100\n= 131mV, as well as a small Tafel slope of 44mV dec−1 in 0.5M H2SO4 and long-term durability of over 24 h under time-dependent current density test. Additionally, urchin-like CoP nanocrystal (Fig. 7gh) was also reported as the electrocatalyst to catalyze the hydrogen generation [107].\nOther cobalt phosphide phases such as Co2P [128], CoP2 [129] and CoP3 [130] nanomaterials have also been reported as the HER electrocatalysts. S. Chen and co-workers successfully prepared porous CoP3 concave polyhedron structures through two steps, involving the transformation of Co-MOFs to porous Co3O4 and the subsequent procedure of Co3O4 (Route ii) [130]. The resulting material displayed outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the HER with a small overpotential of η10 = 78mV in 0.5M H2SO4 and showed a high stability in all-pH solutions. The work by N. Li’s group is an exemplary report for being able to successfully synthesize a nanohybrid structure of carbon wrapped Co2P nanoparticles(Co2P@C) on carbon cloth (Fig. 8a-c) [128]. Benefitted from the feature of nanohybrid structures, the as-synthesized Co2P@C showed excellent conductivity and abundant active sites toward the HER, and exhibited low onset overpotential of 42mV and overpotential of η100 = 179mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 8d). Similarly, a nanocomposite structure of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supporting CoP2 nanoparticles (CoP2/RGO) was reported by J. Liu and co-workers (Fig. 8e-f) [129]. The synergistic effect of CoP2 nanoparticles of high intrinsic electrochemical activity and graphene of excellent electrical conductivity further enhances the electrochemical performance. When tested for HER, the CoP2/RGO displayed higher activities, requiring the overpotential of η10 = 88mV and Tafel slope of 50mV dec−1 in 1.0M KOH (Fig. 8g), than that of bulk CoP2."

And the abundant resource of iron atoms render FePx low cost for industrial application. Superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution has been realized based on FeP [111], Fe2P [138] and Fe3P [138]. Whitmire et al. synthesized phase-pure FexP (x=1, 2, 3) thin films (Fig. 9a-c) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to study their comparative catalytic activities [138]. Their HER activity follows the trend FeP < Fe2P < Fe3P with the lowest overpotential of η10 = 49mV for Fe3P. From the DFT calculations (Fig. 9d-f), the hydrogen binding strength on the surface of Fe3P (100), Fe2P (100), and the Fe-terminated FePFe-t (011) revealed that hydrogen universally prefers binding to Ferich region, resulting in higher hydrogen coverages on Fe-rich Fe2P and Fe3P surface for the incoming HER process. Additionally, FeP nanoparticles with uniform hollow sphere structure were prepared to realize the electrocatalytic HER activity in different media [111]. And Sun’s group reported that the low onset overpotential of 16mV and η10 of 55mV could be achieved upon FeP nanowires on Ti foil in 0.5M H2SO4 [114]. A drawback that has to be mentioned here is the fact that FeP demonstrate a poor stability due to the easy corrosion occurred on its surface in acidic solution.\nIn order to improve the long-term durability of HER electrocatalyst under harsh reaction conditions, Y. E. Sung and co-workers prepared carbon-shell-protected FeP nanoparticles (NPs) through the simultaneous phosphidation and carbonization method (Fig. 10a) [139]. During the thermal treatment, chemical conversion from polymer coating to carbon shell and Fe2O3 nanoparticles to FeP nanoparticles occurs at the same time. As expected, the long-term durability of FeP nanoparticles with a carbon shell was realized, even though FeP nanoparticles with or without carbon shell showed a consistent activity (Fig. 10b-c). As shown in Fig. 10d-e, the EXAFS analysis showed that the uncoated FeP NPs is slightly shifted to the left after 5000 potential cycles, while the carbon-shell-coated ones show little difference. These results confirm the carbon shell could effectively prevent the FeP from oxidation and corrosion."

      "text" : "As to the copper phosphide, the Cu3P were considered for electrocatalytic HER [140–147]. A Cu3P unit cell is alternately stacked with four different sites of copper and one kind of phosphorus to form the deformed triangular prism (Fig. 11a) [140]. Based on the theoretical calculations, its (110) surface is usually exposed and acts as the active site for HER. This result is also consistent with the experimentally reported result [141]. In this regard, X. Sun’s group directly grew selfsupported Cu3P nanowires on copper foam (Cu3P NW) by hypophosphite-based reaction route (Route ii) [142]. The Cu3P electrode showed moderate HER performance with overpotential of η10\n= 143mV and Tafel slope of 67mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4. P. Du et al. recently prepared Cu3P nanosheet (Cu3P NS) on nickel foam (Fig. 11bc) [141]. The Cu3P NS exhibited high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance toward HER in 1.0 M KOH with overpotential of η10 = 105mV and Tafel slope of 42mV dec−1 (Fig. 11d). Meanwhile, the overpotential was negligibly decreased under a fixed catalytic current density of 10mA cm−2 for 24 h (Fig. 11e), confirming its robustness for hydrogen evolution with a long time. The electrolysis experiment produced ∼1200 μmol H2 within one hour, revealing the high faraday efficiency of 98% (Fig. 11f).\nTo be noted, the Cu3P were explored as HER electrocatalyst, but was\nstill inferior to extensively studied Ni [49], Co [132] or Fe [148] based TMP electrocatalysts. Thus, in order to further enhance the HER activity, S. Zang et al. fabricated hierarchical Cu3P nanoparticles coated by a N, P-co-doped carbon shell (Cu3P@NPPC) (Fig. 12a-b) to realize the outstanding HER activity [143]. As shown in Fig. 12c, this hierarchical Cu3P@NPPC structure displayed a large specific surface area of 1004.7 m2 g−1. Expectedly, Cu3P@NPPC cathode exhibited excellent HER activity with the overpotential of η10 = 89mV (Fig. 12d) and longterm durability after 3000 potential cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4. The porosity of Cu3P@NPPC could effectively promote the transportation of reactants and products, as well as provide additional active sites for electrocatalytic reaction. Additionally, another heterostructure (i.e., NiCoP@Cu3P) was constructed for enhancing HER performance by\nutilizing the synergistic effect between Cu3P and NiCoP [144]."

Of note, it also possesses Pt-like electronic structure [62,100,158], suggesting that it will be the potential candidates for efficient HER performance. X. Wang’s [100] and X. Sun’s [108] groups experimentally verified the considerable electrocatalytic activity of MoP compound toward HER. The MoP electrocatalyst was synthesized using phosphate-based reaction strategy (Route ii). After evaluating the HER activity of Mo, Mo3P and MoP [100], they found that the\nphosphorization could modify the property of Mo metal and lead to the distinct HER performance under various phosphorization degree. DFT calculations indicated that a good “H delivery” system formed on MoP endowed it nearly zero binding to H atoms. The P atoms acted as “hydrogen deliverer”, which adsorb hydrogen at low coverage whilst desorb hydrogen at high coverage. Of note, This MoP catalyst showed high activity to HER in both acidic and alkaline media. Coincidentally, the Tafel slope of 54mV dec−1, along with the overpotential of 180mV at 30mA cm−2, in 0.5M H2SO4 was obtained.\nUnfortunately, MoP formed at high temperature phosphorization usually cause the agglomeration and sintering of MoP nanostructures [159,160]. To solve this problem, constructing heterstructures based on MoP is a crucial way. For example, Wang et al. used hypophosphitebased reaction strategy (Route ii) to successfully fabricate highly dispersed, small-sized, and well-crystallized MoP nanoparticles onto carbon nanotube (CNT) sidewalls [149]. Fig. 13a demonstrates the growth process of MoP/CNT heterostructured catalyst. As shown in Fig. 13b, the well-crystallized MoP nanoparticles were uniformly bonded to the sidewalls of CNT and the introduction of CNT effectively inhibited the aggregation of MoP nanoparticles. The resulting MoP/ CNT exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity of HER and excellent stability in pH-universal media. To further improve the electrochemical HER activity and structural stability of MoP, Li and co-workers developed a MOF-assisted strategy to synthesize porous carbon supported MoP nanoparticle (MoP@PC) [150]. The commercial MoO3 were confined in the ultrafine pores of UIO-66 MOF via simple high-temperature heating process, and sequentially made to pass through in situ carbonization, etching, and phosphorization reactions to form a MoP@PC nano-octahedrons hybrid. As shown in Fig. 13c-e, the well-defined octahedral morphology of MoP@PC was prepared. The lattice fringes of MoP nanoparticles with the d spacing distance of its (100) planes are clearly observed. Compared with other catalysts, like MoO2@PC, Mo2C@PC, and MoN@PC, as-obtained MoP@PC hybrid not only exhibited excellent HER activity, but also demonstrated outstanding\nstability emanated from protection of carbon shell."

Thereinto, WP and WP2 were extensively studied as catalysts for HDS [161]. These works indicate that tungsten phosphides will be the alternatives to electrochemically catalyze the water splitting for hydrogen gas [162,163]. In 2014, Mcenaney et al. reported the amorphous WP nanoparticles deposited onto Ti foil substrates as an efficient HER electrocatalyst [164]. Then, a novel three-dimensional WP nanorod arrays on carbon cloth prepared by Sun’s group showed superb stability in HER process [109]. And there was no obvious degradation in activity within continuous testing of 70 h. Under the same situation, Sun’s group also synthesized phosphorus-enriched tungsten diphosphide (WP2) submicroparticles with MoP2-type structure [116]. It revealed remarkable HER performance with η10 = 161mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, the self-supported WP2 nanowires (Fig. 14a) were then synthesized by Wang and co-workers on carbon cloth via in-situ topological transformation with hypophosphite-based reaction strategy (Route ii) [119]. As shown in Fig. 14b, this WP2 crystallize demonstrates the monoclinic NbAs2 structure type. The DFT calculations of its electronic band structure and density of state (DOS, Fig. 14c) showed the overlapped conduction (CB) and valence band (VB) at the Fermi level, suggesting its metallic character and excellent electronic conductivity. The resulting electrode showed superior catalytic activity (Fig. 14d) and stability which can be exemplified from the low overpotentials of η10 = 109mV and a small Tafel slope of 56mV dec−1 in acidic media. What’s more, the hybrids based on tungsten phosphides are popular. In this regard, Mu et al. developed a facile synthesis of well-crystallized WP nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (WP NPs@NC) by high temperature solid-phase reaction of ammonium phosphate (Route ii) to improve HER activity [165]. As demonstrated in Fig. 14e, the WP NPs with the size< 5 nm is\nencapsulated by ultrathin carbon shell. And this electrocatalyst exhibited enhanced HER performance (Fig. 14f) with a low overpotential of η10 = 102mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and superior durability (4 days). More importantly, the WP NPs@NC also showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the HER in both neutral and alkaline conditions."

      "text" : "Based on the aforementioned metal phosphides, the tuning of their\ncomponent could effectively improve the catalytic activity. In this regard, the cation and anion substitution are widely adopted [166–176]. In order to obtain insights into the trends and guidelines for systematically improving their intrinsic activity, T. F. Jaramillo et al. utilized experimental-theoretical approach to study the relation between HER activities, ΔGH* and various TMPs [39]. Fig. 15a and b plot the normalized current density of various TMP catalysts measured at the overpotential of 100mV and the average TOF vs the calculated ΔGH* respectively, yielding volcano shapes. The mixed TMP, Fe0.5Co0.5P, showed a near-optimal ΔGH* with highest current density and average TOF. Their work reveals that the binary metal composition could regulate the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts to boost the intrinsic activity. Later, Chen et al. synthesized a series of bimetallic FexCo1−xP (0 < x < 1) nanowire arrays on carbon cloth (Fig. 15c) as HER electrocatalyst and confirmed that Fe0.5Co0.5P possessed Pt-like electrocatalytic performance with the overpotential of only η10 = 37mV in 0.5M H2SO4 (Fig. 15d) and superior long-term electrochemical stability for at least 100 h (Fig. 15e) [177]. Furthermore, they also found that hydrogen production activity of FexCo1-xP nanowire is strongly related to Fe substitution ratio. DFT calculations indicated that the proper Fe substitution in the electrocatalyst would result in more optimal ΔGH* Fig. 15f). The ΔGH value of Fe0.5Co0.5P is closest to zero with a highest electrocatalytic activity toward HER, which is consistent with Jaramillo’s work.\nAdditionally, the substitution of phosphorus atoms with sulfur atoms in metal phosphides to form transition metal phosphosulphides (TMPS) is considered to be an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic HER activity. In this regard, some TMPS electrocatalysts, such\nas CoPS and MoPS [178–181] have been designed and synthesized. The S substitution could induce the shift of d-band center due to the difference in electronegativity of S and P atoms. After introducing S into the surface region of MoP films or MoP for getting MoP|S films [180] and MoS2(1-x)Px solid solution [181], the HER performance is effectively enhanced comparing to the pristine MoP electrocatalyst. To develop a non-noble metal based catalyst with Pt-like electrocatalytic activity for HER, Jin et al. reported a combined experimental and theoretical approach to study highly active nanostructured pyrite-type cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) as electrocatalyst [179]. Different with CoS2 consisting of Co2+ octahedral and S22- dumbbells, the cubic crystal structure of CoPS has a smaller lattice constant than CoS2 and a composition of Co3+ octahedral and dumbbells with a homogeneous distribution of P2- and S- atoms (Fig. 16a). From the theoretical calculation, the adsorbed atomic hydrogen at the Co sites of CoPS were more favorable than that of CoS2, and the ΔGH of adsorption hydrogen at the adjacent Co sites became spontaneous and almost thermoneutral (Fig. 16b), which is attributed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ on hydrogen adsorption at adjacent open P sites. Therefore, the resulting CoPS electrocatalyst exhibited superb HER performance with a low overpotential of η10 = 48mV and long-term stability over 36 h in 0.5M H2SO4 (Fig. 16c-d). Similarly, Wang et al. also reported cobalt phosphosulfide nanoparticles (CoP|S) grown on carbon nanotubes with high activity and stability for hydrogen generation [178]. Further study found that the incorporation of P can observably impact the nature of chemical bonding between Co and S/P. As demonstrated in Fig. 16e, the phosphosulfides (CoS2-xPx) were more stable in the cubic structure when the S atoms are replaced by P. And the P substitution could give rise to the depletion of antibonding eg*, thereby strengthening the chemical stability of the catalyst during the hydrogen generation (Fig. 16f)."

      "text" : "Transition metal carbides (TMCs) constitute diverse class of materials with a vast interest over the past years due to their appealing properties such as high conductivity, superior chemical stability and\nthermal stability [182–189]. These materials are also known as interstitial alloys as the carbon atoms occupy the interstitial positions. Most transition metals, except for the second and third row group 9–10 metals (e.g., Rh, Ir, Pd, and Pt), form carbides with significant variation\nin their crystal structure. The bonding arises from the interaction of 2s and 2p orbitals of the carbon with d orbital of the transition metal. The parent metal structure varies from body-centered cubic (bcc) to hexagonal closed packed (hcp) to face-centered cubic (fcc) with increasing\nthe sp electrons. Elements to the left in the periodic table adopt the bcc structure (e.g., Nb, Ta, Mo and W), but those in the center prefer the hcp structure (e.g., Tc, Re, Ru and Os) and furthest to the right prefer the fcc structure (e.g., Rh, Ir, Pd and Pt) [190–192]. When the carbon atom is made to occupy the interstitial position, it results in the expanding of dorbitals in the metal giving rise to the formation of interstitial alloys [193]. The occupancy of the metal’s d-band governs the metal-tocarbon ratio of the incoming metal carbide. Accordingly, transition metals in Group 4 and 5 have incompletely filled bands capable of accommodating high amount of sp-carbon orbitals mostly resulting in the formation of MC (e.g., TiC, VC, NbC and TaC). As we do the same analysis for other groups, M2C (e.g., Mo2C and W2C) occurs for transition metals in Group 6 while M3C (e.g., Mn3C, Fe3C, Co3C and Ni3C) is the preferred stoichiometry for the transition metals in Group 7 and 8. Table 3 shows that there is an increasing trend of M-to-C ratio moving to the right in the periodic table, suggesting the difficulty of accommodating carbon atoms into the metals of the right side. Thus, those metals in Group 9–10 form unstable carbides [182,194].\nMany of the reported carbides are of in low surface areas, defying their wide spread applications in catalysis. Moreover, char contamination is the frequently appearing problem in synthesizing metal carbides. Carbides with char contaminants exhibit poor catalytic performance as the impurities would block the cavities and active sites that are essential for catalysis [195]. The synthetic method should enable the utmost exposure of active sites on the surface to realize efficient catalysis. In this regard, pyrolysis of metal carbonyl compounds, or direct reaction of metal/metal oxide with carbon source, as in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, are among the commonly employed methods involving solid-solid reactions or gas-solid reactions to realize high surface area metal carbide catalysts. As mentioned above, the metal to carbon molar ratio is of crucial in determining the stability and catalytic activity of the incoming metal carbide. Thus, governing parameter has to be carefully identified and tuned in the synthesis method to fabricate the desired ratio. As such, the type of precursors used, temperature of the reaction, and gas flow rate are known to be the most prevailing factors in controlling the growth of metal carbides. The work by Loh et al. shows the effect of gas flow rate in tuning the structure and composition of Mo2C [196]. Different flow rates of methane gas impart different forms of product.\nApart from CVD method, many researchers have utilized the method of carburizing the metal precursors in organic compounds, such as aniline [197], melamine [198], dopamine [199], etc. and inorganic compounds like g-C3N4 [200] and carbon nanotube [201]. These strategies involve first formation of a solid solution via dissolving the metal precursors into the selected carbon source followed by calcination at optimum temperature. The diffusion rate of carbon atom away from inorganic sources is relatively slower as compared to organic sources [201]. This can avoid excess carbon deposition and thereby eliminates char contamination. Given the appropriate carbon source and metal precursors used, this approach is preferable to those of gas-phase methods in yielding engineered nanostructured materials and providing a platform to a well dispersed catalyst in supporting substrate [193].\nThe rationale behind the exploration of HER catalytic activity for\nNote: GCE, glassy carbon electrode; CPE, carbon paste electrode.\ntransition metal carbides is associated with the work of R. B. Levy and M. Boudart who for the first time noted the Pt-like catalytic behavior in WC [202]. It has been suggested that carbon sp electrons increased the apparent electron to atom ratio thereby producing a more Pt-like electronic structure. Accordingly, the formation of early transition metal carbides involves the pd orbitals hybridization to form covalent bond between the metal and carbon. These bonds constitute both σ and π bonds that are characterized by low lying bonding orbitals, separated by a gap from the antibonding orbitals. The metal σ bonds are located in this gap in which the Fermi energy passes through ultimately producing a Pt and Pd like density of states. It is, thus, believed that the catalytic behavior is emanated from these bonds which gives rise to the predicted coincidence with Pt. Up to now, as collected in Table 4, various metal carbide electrocatalysts are studied as HER electrocatalysts under different conditions. In the following subsections, the HER properties of frequently reported metal carbides will be reviewed."

      "text" : "It has been reported that tungsten carbide and platinum behave\nsimilarly as catalysts in various chemical reactions [202]. Spectroscopic investigations proved a solid similarity in the Fermi level electronic density of states (DOS) WC and Pt [203,204]. However, this resemblance is not evident for W vs Pt or W vs WC. This brought a fundamental basis to extensively explore different forms of tungsten carbide to practically mimic the catalytic activity of Pt [205–208]. Of the various forms of tungsten carbide investigated thus far, tremendous amount of interest have been devoted to WC [209,210]. Unfortunately, the obtained WC catalyst usually suffers from uncontrollable particle agglomeration and additional carbon impurities deposition, the presence of which causes fewer active sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon impurities deposited on the surface could block reactants from accessing active sites and conspicuously reduce or eliminate the electrocatalytic activity of WC [211]. Another problem associated with WC for HER electro catalysis is the sluggish kinetics due to a strong tungstenhydrogen bond formation [209].\nVarious strategies were adopted to solve these problems (e.g., agglomeration, carbon contamination and sluggish kinetics). In this regard, the size controlled synthesis of tungsten carbide via a cage-confinement pyrolysis strategy can be considered as a vital importance to inhibit crystal aggregation. This was reported by X. Chen et al. who developed a MOFs-based cage-confinement pyrolysis to obtain tungsten carbide nanoclusters/nanoparticles with sizes ca. 2 nm [212]. Benefitting from the ultra-small size, the WC nanopartciales exhibit a platinum-like catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, the growth of WC on tips of vertically aligned carbon nanotube has also been suggested as a way forward to prevent agglomeration [213]. The direct reaction of tungsten metal with carbon source in hot filament chemical vapor deposition led to the synthesis of single crystal WC with small size (4.5–21.6 nm) and uniform distribution on the carbon nanotubes. Although the performance of the obtained sample, WC-CNT, is not yet comparable to that of platinum, the synthesis strategy opens up a very good avenue to prevent aggregation of nanoparticles and even design heterostructures with other functional materials.\nAs to the carbon contamination, the work by Y. R. Leshkov et al. can be regarded as a rational approach to simultaneously prevent sintering of the WC nanoparticles while also mitigating surface impurity deposition [214]. They introduced a universal method to synthesize metal-terminated WC nanoparticles in the 1–4 nm range on the highsurface-area supports (Fig. 17a). This unique edge termination was obtained through three key steps including the preparation of WOx NPs encapsulated within SiO2 matrix followed by carbonization (CH4/H2) of composite particles and removal of SiO2 shell. A roughly 100-fold enhancement in catalytic performance was noted for such the metal terminated carbides as compared to commercial WC. During the electrolysis of water, hydrogen atoms bind strongly in between two W atoms,\ndefying the release of H2 fromWC(001) [209,215]. This gives rise to the sluggish kinetics mentioned earlier in this topic. In the quest for optimum WC surface that binds H+ neither too strongly nor too weakly, Sun et al. doped nitrogen in WC to tune the surface energy thereby easing the evolution of H2 gas [209]. This was achieved via simultaneous reduction, carbonization, and N-doping of pre-synthesized WO3 nanoarrays (Fig. 17b). The doping of N atoms conspicuously boosts the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst at atomic level, tackling the problem of sluggish surface. The superaerophobic nanoarray structure not only exposes more active sites for electrochemical hydrogen generation but also weakens bubble adhesion to facilitate hydrogen release with overpotential of only η10 = 89mV and excellent activity in overall water splitting reaction.\nThe survey on reports related to tungsten carbide reveals that the focus of researchers exclusively devoted to WC. The other carbide compound—W2C has received far less attention [216] despite the fact that W2C is potentially more HER-active than WC from the basis of theoretical calculations [201]. It is usually obtained as a by-product of WC [217]. The scarce reports on W2C is associated with its thermodynamic unaffordability below 1250 °C [218]. It is the work of Lee’s group that communicated the controllable synthesis of W2C and evaluated the HER performance inspired by the theoretical simulations [201], there are a higher electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level W2C than WC. They followed in-situ carburization strategy in the presence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) and WOx precursors under high temperature and low pressure (Fig. 17c). This gave rise to slow diffusion of carbon atom from MWCNT to WOx thereby ensuring a carbon deficient product (it means favoring the formation of W2C over that of WC). This material exhibits an excellent HER catalytic activity as can be corroborated from the small onset overpotential of 50mV and Tafel slope of 45mV dec−1 in 0.5M H2SO4.\nIt is, therefore, evident that tungsten carbide compounds (W2C and WC) are among the most promising alternatives to platinum as a HER catalyst. Promising strategies including nanostructuring, optimizing hydrogen binding energy, designing supporting material, etc. have been reported so far for improving their efficiency and reliability."

Particularly, β-Mo2C exhibits appealing catalytic properties even in their bulk states [224]. It is also noted that the investigation of four types different phases, derived from their amine–metal oxide derivatives, imparts a trend of βMo2C> γ-MoC> η-MoC> α-MoC1-x in catalytic activities [225]. The performance could be further improved by constructing various nanostructures. Ma et al. reported excellent electrocatalytic activities of βMo2C nanotube and nanosheet architectures, from which maximal utilization of active sites and rapid transport of electrons, were observed [61]. The uniform β-Mo2C nanocrystallites embedded in a carbon matrix owns porous hierarchical hollow structure in one dimensional network ensuring the enlarged contact surface and facilitates charge/mass transfer during the electrochemical reactions. These features can ultimately be corroborated from the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER in both acidic and alkaline solution. Other morphologies, like nanowires [226], have also been reported to demonstrate a remarkably high electrocatalytic activity with their porous surface. For instance, the work by Girault et al. substantiates the prominent role of the nanoporous cavities on Mo2C nanowires [226]. The hollow nanoporous structure was obtained without aggregation on individual nanowires to ensure a shortened electron transfer distance in the catalytic reaction. Utilizing metal organic frameworks as a precursor to synthesize porous metal carbides (even other porous materials) is emerging strategy offering unique benefits for a wide spread applications. Inspired by this, a remarkably efficient electrocatalysis of HER was observed from porous MoCx nano-octahedrons obtained via\nMOFs assisted synthesis method [51]. Interestingly, a uniform porous structure was obtained that are largely originated from the ordered and porous structure of MOFs. The current scenario in this research endeavor focuses on designing appropriate supports for the metal carbides [222,226,227]. The supports provide a vital role in electrocatalytic activities for metal carbides. Of the frequently employed materials as supports, carbon nanotube and graphene are acknowledged for stabilizing the metal carbides nanostructures, providing a large surface area for facile contact with electrolyte and ensuring excellent electron pathway to and from the surface of the metal carbides [63]. In this premises, Lee and co-workers reported a highly active and stable HER electrocatalyst based on carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene hybrid support for Mo2C nanoparticles [63]. The structure of the hybrid support not only efficiently alleviates the aggregation of Mo2C nanocrystals, but also significantly improves the electrical conductivity therein. As a result, the supported Mo2C exhibited excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of η10 = 62mV and a small Tafel slope of 58mV dec−1 as well as the long-term stability in 0.5M H2SO4. Theoretically, it is believed that super active nonmetal catalytic sites are created following the synergistic interaction between the metal carbide matrix and the adjacent carbon atoms in the support. The emerged catalytic sites are more active than those in the constituents. Theoretical calculations [50] show that the Mo2C and N dopants in the material synergistically co-activate adjacent C atoms on the carbon nanolayers, creating superactive nonmetallic catalytic sites for HER that are more active than those in the constituents. This was observed in ultrasmall Mo2C nanoparticles wrapped in N-rich carbon nanolayers (Mo2C@NC) [50]. Some components from the support material are doped into the metal carbide and initiate electronic coupling leading to a developed synergism. This can be exemplified from the work of Lan and co-workers [62], who fabricated 2D coupled hybrid composed of Mo2C nanoparticles encapsulated by N, P-codoped carbon shells and N, P-codoped reduced graphene oxide (Mo2C@NPC/NPRGO). Taking advantage of the synergistic catalytic effects of carbon shell coated Mo2C NPs, heteroatoms (N, P) are doped into the carbon matrix and unique 2D coupled composite structure (Fig. 18a-d), the resulting catalyst exhibited superb electrocatalytic performance for HER. Similar to commercial Pt/C, only 0mV for onset overpotential and a low overpotential of η10 = 34mV are required (Fig. 18e), as well as a small Tafel slope of 33.6mV dec−1\nin acidic media is recorded. Furthermore, carbides of molybdenum can, along with those of\ntungsten based carbides, can be regarded as one of the representative\ncatalysts to replace Pt-group metals. From the basis of their thin film studies, it is observed that pristine Mo2C is more active towards HER than pristine WC. However, Mo2C is limited by low electrochemical stability than WC [228,229]. A strategy is, therefore, required to combine these advantageous features (stability from W-C and activity from Mo-C) and realize efficient catalysis. Fabrication of bimetallic MoxW1-xC is reported [214]. Owing to its larger Wigner-Seitz radius, Mo atoms compresses the lattice of WC after being inserted to form MoxW1-xC. This gives rise to modulation of the d-band surface DOS and hence establishing enhanced catalysis [214]."

      "text" : "The fourth period (3d) metal elements are known to be the highest\nabundance and lowest-priced elements. Thus, their corresponding carbide compounds should be worthy of more attention as the HER catalysts. However, very few investigations have been carried out on fourth period metal carbides (e.g., Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni) due to their poor electrochemical activity and instability, as well as limited synthetic approaches [230]. Starting our discussion with Ti based carbides, one can see that MXene nanofibers of Ti3C2 has been elucidated as high surface area electrocatalyst [231]. Compared to traditional Ti3C2 flakes, the as-synthesized Ti3C2 nanofiber delivered a much higher specific surface area and exposed more active sites for HER activity. As a result, the obtained Ti3C2 nanofiber exhibited an enhanced hydrogen production activity with an overpotential of η10 = 169mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, the comparison made among nine carbides of transition metals, including TiC, V8C7, HfC, ZrC, Cr3C2, Nb4C3, WC, Mo2C, reveals that Mo2C, WC, and V8C7 deliver particularly enhanced HER activity compared with others [232]. Inspired by this, Y. Wang et al. designed a graphited-carbon enveloped single-crystal interweaved V8C7 nanosheets on nickel foam (V8C7 @GC NSs) as an efficient HER electrocatalyst (Fig. 19a-c) [233]. In contrast with conventional pure vanadium carbide [230], V8C7 @GC NSs contains a 12.5% of carbon sites that are not filled. Therefore, in and around the defect of carbon sites, the redundant electrons are delocalized among the neighboring V atoms and the electron-enrich carbon vacancy serves as an active center. Furthermore, highly active crystal face (110) exposed and confinement effect of double-deck carbon coating contributes to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Consequently, the singlecrystal interweaved V8C7 nanosheets exhibits electrocatalytic performance comparable to those of Pt over wide pH range, with overpotential of η10 = 38mV, η10 = 77mV, and η10 = 47mV and Tafel\nslope of 34.5, 64 and 44mV dec−1 in 0.5M H2SO4, 1.0 M PBS, and 1.0M KOH, respectively [233].\nAs to the chromium based carbides, the work of B. Leonard et al. can be regarded as a very good example to demonstrate the HER activity trend across various ratios [234]. They reported a low temperature salt flux synthesis route for preparing pure phase chromium carbide with\nfive different crystal structures as the HER electrocatalysts, including three common phases, Cr3C2, Cr7C3, and Cr23C6, and two rarely studied meta-stable phases, Cr2C and CrC. All of the five phases of Cr-C were synthesized and isolated thoroughly via facilely tuning the chromium/ carbon ratio, reaction temperature and annealing time. It was further observed that the electrocatalytic HER activity of Cr-C can be correlated\nwell with differences in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level and types of bonding in each structure. With this premises, the most active phase is Cr7C3, which has the highest DOS at the Fermi level.\nPromising results have also been found from Fe [235], Co [236], and Ni [237] based carbides in the last few years. To further enhance the electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity, Q. Yan et al. doped optimum amount of Fe into Ni3C nanodots to optimize the electronic structure and surface composition of the electrocatalyst [237]. As a result, the Fe-Ni3C exhibits better electrocatalytic activity (overpotential of η10 = 178mV) than that of bare Ni3C (overpotential of η10 = 235mV). Notably, the work of X. Gou’s group [235] provides a comprehensive analysis over M3C (M=Fe, Co, Ni) grown on vertically aligned graphene nanoribbons via hot filament CVD method Fig. 19d-e. The graphene nanoribbon support plays a vital role in the design of these M3C catalysts. It does not only provide high surface area for M3C growth without aggregation, but also significantly enhance the conductivity of the obtained electrocatalyst to facilitate charge/proton transfer along the basal surfaces. As a result, the synergistic effect between 1D M3C and 2D graphene nanoribbons gives the M3C-GNRs superior HER performance as exemplified from the result of Fe3C HER performance (overpotential of η10 = 49mV and Tafel slope of 46mV dec−1 in 0.5M H2SO4)."

      "heading" : "3.3. Transition metal nitrides",
      "text" : "Resembling TMCs, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are also referred to as interstitial alloys. The nitrogen atoms, being small size, are inserted into the interstices of the metal lattice thereby resulting in the modification of the metal’s d-band electronic structure [191,238]. To this end, the nitride surface usually displays an electron donating characteristics [239]. Further studies have found that the electronic structure of metal nitrides is remarkably different from those of the parent metal. The introduction of nitrogen will endow the electronic structure of TMNs with Pt-like behavior [193,194,240,241]. These promising features, coupled with their low electrical resistance and good corrosion resistance, give rise to the fact that TMNs have potential to replace Pt in the field of electrocatalysis [194]. For electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction, metal nitrides exhibit outstanding activity that can be ascribed to the appropriate (neither to strong nor too weak) adsorption energy of H+ on their active sites.\nTo date, the synthesis of metal nitrides are largely made through the high-temperature (500–800 °C) nitridation routes. The commonly involved reactions include gas-solid reactions (e.g., the reaction between metal precursor and ammonia gas [65,66,242,243]) or solid-solid reactions (e.g., the reaction between metal precursor and nitrogen-containing organic compounds [244,245]) to realize the controllable synthesis of metal nitrides. But, the contamination of carbon and oxygen will be introduced in this synthesis method and gave rise to the deteriorating the expected catalytic activity. For instance, some metal nitrides (Ni3FeN and NiMoN) were obtained via nitridation of metal hydroxide with ammonia [246] or N2 plasma treatment of the parent metal [247], both of which are known to be limited by weak controllability over shape and the preferred crystalline phase. And their HER catalytic activities recorded are not as such impressive. In the following subsections, the HER properties of frequently reported metal nitrides will be reviewed.\nUp to now, different kinds of TMNs, like molybdenum nitride (MoN) [65,66], tungsten nitride (WN) [248,249], nickel nitride (Ni3N) [242,250] and cobalt nitride (Co4N) [251], have been discovered to be electrocatalysts for hydrogen production (Table 5). Among these metal nitrides, the Mo and W based nitrides are attracting considerable attention owing to their tendency to mimic catalytic behavior to precious metals. Yet, there is still a concern of susceptibility to poisoning and deactivation [193,252]. The mechanism of HER electrocatalysis relied on these nitrides has remained debatable till the work of Xie et al., who prepared MoN nanosheets with atomic thickness (1.3 nm) via liquid\nexfoliation of MoN bulk (Fig. 20a-b) for theoretical and experimental elucidation of the active sites [253]. The calculated DOS of the single layer MoN slab demonstrated that the metallic MoN (Fig. 20c) nanosheets possess higher charge density than that of bulk material (Fig. 20d), which means that MoN nanosheets can effectively facilitate electron transfer during the electrocatalytic HER process. The exposed apical Mo atoms on the surface of MoN nanosheets can serve as active site in HER. With such a unique atom alignment and improved conductivity, excellent catalytic activity has been realized from MoN.\nIn order to improve the HER catalytic activity of metal nitrides, various approaches have been suggested to tune the electronic and hence ultimately optimizing the H ion adsorption and H2 molecule desorption [53,254–256]. In one hand, bimetallic nitrides (e.g., NiMoN [53,247], CoMoN [257] and NiFeN [246]) have been widely studied owing to their tendency to introduce such electronic perturbations following the interaction between the two dissimilar transition metals. For example, R. Adzic et al. have successfully realized the optimum MoH binding energy after introducing Ni atom into MoN to form NiMoNx nanosheet with the thickness of 4–15 nm [243]. They confirmed the strong interaction between Mo and Ni atoms through EXAFS analysis, revealing an increment in Ni-Ni distance and a decrement in Ni-Mo distance with the nitridation process. As a result, the HER activity of the obtained NiMoNx (onset overpotential of 78mV and Tafel slope of 35.9 mV dec−1) is much higher than that of MoN (onset overpotential of 157mV and Tafel slope of 54.5 mV dec−1). In another study, T. Zhang et al. prepared Ni3FeN nanoparticles (NPs) with a particle size of 100 nm as an efficient and durable HER electrocatalyst [246]. Its electrocatalytic activity outperformed the bulk Ni3FeN, the monometallic nitride (Ni3N) and mixed metal oxide (NiFe-MMO) in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH). In the other hand, constructing heterostructure of metal nitrides with nanocarbon or/and other transition metal-based compounds is considered as an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic hydrogen production activity [52,54,64,242,244,258]. S. Qiao’s group synthesized a nanohybrid catalyst of 2D molybdenum nitride and 2D carbon nitride (MoN@C3N4) through an interface engineering strategy [66]. The SEM and TEM images (Fig. 21a) of MoN@C3N4 demonstrate the 2D morphology with the g-C3N4 growing on the surface of MoN nanosheets. From the DFT calculations and the corresponding projected density of states (PDOS) spectra (Fig. 21b), a charge redistribution occurs at the interlayer between MoN and C3N4 with the accumulation of electrons. Meanwhile, the electrons are transferred from the inner MoN layer to the outer g-C3N4 layer (Fig. 21c). As a result, the well-designed MoN@C3N4 nanosheets exhibits excellent electrochemical activity for HER with an overpotential η10 = 110mV in 1.0M KOH, which is remarkably lower than that of the single component counterpart and the physical mixture MoN@C3N4 (Fig. 21d). The work of Fu et al. was another exemplary report to elucidate the benefit of heterostructures based on metal nitrides for enhancing the catalytic activity [54]. They fabricated a heterostructure of holey reduced graphene (HGr) oxide coupled with small-sized Mo2NMo2C (Mo2N-Mo2C/HGr) (Fig. 21e-f). Benefiting from the excellent charge/mass transfer ability of HGr, the high dispersion of small-sized nanoparticles and the intimate contact between Mo2C and Mo2N, the resulting Mo2N-Mo2C/HGr heterojunction exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen generation performance over a series of control samples in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The DFT calculations showed that the ΔGH* appeared to have its smallest value on the N site of the N-Mo-C interface (Fig. 21g-h), indicating that the N site should be the main active center in the Mo2N-Mo2C/HGr heterostructure. It can be seen that transition metal nitrides are promising electrocatalysts for HER, though so far hampered by the inefficient exposure of active sites. Thus, the development of novel synthetic methods (or improvement of the existing ones) is considered as the prerequisite for further insight into the designing advanced HER electrocatalysts."

      "text" : "Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been widely used in fields of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) [259–261], oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [262–264], and photochemical reduction reaction [265–267] owing to their environmentally benignity, stability and cost-effective characteristics. Unfortunately, most metal oxides fail to electrocatalyze hydrogen evolution reaction due to their low intrinsic electrical conductivity and inappropriate free energy of hydrogen adsorption [268–273]. Considering their considerable OER performance, it is of immense importance to develop TMO-based HER catalyst to form a\nbifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. To date, substantial efforts, e.g., nanostructuring [274], creating oxygen vacancies [35], constructing heterostructure of TMO with carbon materials [67] or metal [68,275] and doping the heteroatom into TMO crystal [276], have been made to improve the hydrogen production activity of TMObased electrocatalysts. As collected in Table 6, various metal oxide electrocatalysts are designed and used as electrocatalysts for HER under different conditions.\nUsually, TMO materials acted as HER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes because they are unstable in acidic solution, especially iron group metal oxides [277–280]. Very recently, S. Qiao’s group reported\nNote: GCE, glassy carbon electrode.\nthe synthesis of NiO nanorods (NRs) (Fig. 22a) with ample oxygen vacancies [281]. And then, they explored the relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and the corresponding electrocatalytic activity. As seen in Fig. 22b, the introduction of oxygen-vacancy in NiO NRs lead to the emergence of some new electronic states close to the Fermi level, which directly result in higher electron transfer rate of oxygen vacancy-enriched NiO nanorods and enhancement of HER performance. The largest carrier concentration, obtained from their Mott-Schottky plots in Fig. 22c, was achieved when the appropriate oxygen vacancies were introduced. Likewise, tungsten oxide (WOx) has attracted extensive research interests in electrocatalysis because it is much more thermodynamically stable in acidic solution than most metal oxides [35,276,282–284]. In this regard, H. Yang et al. prepared oxygen-defect tungsten oxide (WO2.9), as the HER electrocatalyst in\nacidic media, through a facile thermal treatment of commercial WO3 nanoparticles [35]. From Fig. 22d-e, WO2.9 exhibits ordered defect structure with regularly stair-step shape, whereas the WO3 exhibits continuous regular lattice fringes. Subsequent DFT calculations confirmed that the (010) and (001) were the most stable crystal faces for WO2.9 and WO3, respectively. And the new characteristic configuration was observed on the WO2.9(010). Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption energy on WO2.9(010) is close to thermodynamic neutral (ΔGH ≈ 0 eV), suggesting the improvement of HER activity relative to that of WO3(001). As expected, the oxygen-defect WO2.9 (overpotential of η10 = 70mV and Tafel slope of 50mV dec−1) displays better electrochemical hydrogen generation activity compared to pristine WO3 in acidic solution (overpotential of η10 = 637mV and Tafel slope of 120mV dec−1) (Fig. 22f). On this basis, Zeng and co-workers\nNote: GCE, glassy carbon electrode.\nintroduced ample oxygen vacancies into WO3 nanosheets and realized superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in acidic media (overpotential of η10 = 38mV and Tafel slope of 38mV dec−1) [284]. In addition, heterogeneous atom doping can also remarkably improved electrocatalytic performance of tungsten oxide via manipulating the electronic and geometric structure to increase the number of active sites [276]. And constructing heterostructure is also an effective way to enhance the HER performance of TMO-based catalysts. For a instance, a novel NiO-Ni/carbon nanotube nanohybrid (NiO-Ni/CNT) was designed by Dai’s group [68]. Fig. 22g-k shows the presence of approximately 10 nm NiO/Ni nanoparticles with a core shell-like structure anchored to multi-walled carbon nanotube network. The as-obtained NiO-Ni/CNT electrocatalyst exhibits hydrogen evolution activity close to that of Pt (Fig. 22i) in alkaline media as a result of the synergetic effect of the metal, metal oxide, and nanocarbon."

      "text" : "Transition metal borides (TMBs) are exceptionally stable over a wide pH range, revealing their potential ability to serve as alternative HER electrocatalysts [285]. As early as decades ago, L. Kuznetsova et al. studied the HER kinetics on some metal borides in acidic media (1.0M H2SO4) and found that their hydrogen generation activity increases in the order of ZrB2< NbB2< TaB2< W2B5 [286]. In 2012, Hu et al. reported that the commercially available molybdenum boride (α-MoB) is a highly active HER electrocatalyst both in acidic and alkaline media [224]. But, it is a challenge to synthesize the pure metal borides [10,69,287–293]. And the search for appropriate and reliable synthetic methods is of great significance in promoting the development of TMBs in electrochemical hydrogen evolution.\nRecently, some TMB materials have been explored to be HER electrocatalysts (Table 7). A multi-step arc-melting approach was adopted\nby P T Fokwa’s group to prepare Mo2B, α-MoB, β-MoB, and MoB2 [71]. Fig. 23a shows the crystal structures of tetragonal Mo2B and α-MoB, orthorhombic β-MoB, and hexagonal MoB2. Their electrocatalytic activity in acidic electrolyte (0.5M H2SO4) are demonstrated in Fig. 23b, revealing that the hydrogen evolution activity increases with increasing boron content and the boron-rich MoB2 possesses the highest activity for hydrogen generation. This result is similar to the recently reported nickel phosphides [100]. The introduction of non-metal elements could facilitate the trapping of the positively charged protons and enhance the hydrogen adsorption on TMBs for subsequent reaction steps [25,100]. Therefore, inspired by the original aforementioned work, the focus of future electrochemical hydrogen production research should be on boron-rich TMBs. In connection to this, Fokwa’s group [294] also successfully prepared single-phase bulk of Mo2B4 for hydrogen generation by tin flux synthesis [295]. Fig. 23c shows the crystal structure of Mo2B4 with two types of boron layers alternating along [001], a flat\nlayer (graphene-like) and a puckered layer (phosphorene-like). Significantly, the ΔGH* values (Fig. 23d) on two different boron layers are not the same, indicating their different HER activities. The ΔGH* on flat boron layer (flat B-T) reaches zero at around 50% H coverage, whereas that value on the puckered boron layer is far away zero at all H coverage. Additionally, Geyer et al. prepared the boron-rich iron diboride nanoparticles (FeB2 NPs) through a facile chemical reduction of Fe2+ using LiBH4 in an organic solvent [296]. The TEM image of FeB2 NPs in Fig. 23e displays their size in the range of 20–50 nm. Surprisingly, the as-synthesized FeB2 NP catalyst exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for HER (Fig. 23f), requiring the overpotential of only η10 = 61mV and maintaining stability over long-term electrolysis tests in alkaline solution (1.0M KOH). Fig. 23g shows four typical hydrogen adsorption sites with relatively low ΔGH* on the (001) and (110) surfaces of FeB2. The B sites act as the active sites for HER and the lowindex (001) is largely responsible for hydrogen generation on FeB2\nNote: GCE, glassy carbon electrode; CPE, carbon paste electrode.\n(Fig. 23h). As comparison, FeB2 possesses higher hydrogen evolution ability than Fe2B under the same conditions."

      "text" : "In addition to earth-abundant transition metal based compounds as potential replacements of precious metal for HER electrocatalysis, nonnoble transition metals (TMs, i.e., Ni, Co, Fe, Cu etc.) and their alloys are also the focus of recent research. Generally, the research conducted based on TMs is, therefore, limited to only alkaline electrolytes due to their instability in acidic electrolytes [297–300]. Very recently, a variety of TMs nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon nanomaterials (TM@C) including nitrogen-doped graphene [76,301–303] and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes [75,304–306] are of particular interest. The synergistic effect [75,76,305,307,308] between TMs cores and Ndoped carbon shell contributes to the enhancement of HER electrocatalytic performance. In this section, we focus on the non-precious transition metal catalysts for electrochemical HER.\nGenerally, various synthetic methods were utilized to prepare TM electrocatalyst. For pure TMs without the support of carbon nanomaterials, wet-chemical reaction route is usually employed to grow selfsupporting metal precursors, followed by reduction process through electrochemical reduction [298], solvothermal reduction [299,309], and gas-phase reduction [18]. For instance, Sun’s group reported the synthesis of ultrathin nickel nanosheet array (Ni-NSA) via mildly reducing Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays in ethylene glycol solution assisted by NaOH [299]. The resulting Ni nanosheets possessed ten atomic layers in thickness owing to the slow reaction kinetics. While, when preparing carbon nanomaterials supported TM electracatalysts, the simultaneous pyrolysis of nanostructured transition-metal precursors and carbon source [72,75,304,306,310] or pre-prepared MOFs precursors [76,305,311] were used. For example, Hu et al. synthesized a 3D copper-encased N-doped carbon nanotube arrays grown on copper foam (Cu@N-CNT) via the pyrolysis of polydopamine (PDA)-coated Cu2O nanowire arrays [304]. The carbonization of PDA shell and the reduction of Cu2O core are occurred simultaneously. Moreover, the\nmorphology and thickness of N-doped carbon nanotubes can be controlled by the thickness of PDA shells. To date, kinds of non-noble transition metals have been reported in this field (Table 8)."

      "heading" : "4.1. Single metal electrocatalysts",
      "text" : "Researches on non-precious single metal catalysts for HER have focused exclusively on 3d transition metals, such as Fe [312], Co [301,305,306,313] and Ni [298,299,314] owing to their earth abundance, high electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity. They are usually used to catalyze electrochemical hydrogen evolution in neutral or alkaline media [298,299,313,314]. M. Ma et al. designed Co nanocrystal assembled hollow nanoparticles (Co-HNP) as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from neutral-pH water [313]. The results indicated that the catalyst exhibited remarkable HER activity with overpotential of η10 = 85mV and Tafel slope of 38mV dec−1. Sun’s group reported an ultrathin Ni nanosheet arrays (Ni-NSAs) grown on nickel foam [299]. They found that the partial oxidized Ni-NSAs could significantly improve the HER activity in alkaline media. Such superior HER activity was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the Ni/ Ni2+ interface [68]. The strong electrostatic affinity of Ni2+ site for OH-\ngenerated via water dissociation is beneficial to the adsorption of protons by nearby Ni site for successive H2 generation. Inspired by these pioneering studies, Zheng’s group also successfully synthesized ultrathin Ni nanosheets (ca. 1.6 nm thickness) with trace sulfur adsorbed on their surface by electrochemically activating 2D nanosheets of Ni-S coordination polymer (ca. 16 nm thickness) [298]. Fig. 24a-b shows the SEM images of 1, 4-benzenedithiol (BDT) coordinated Ni nanosheets (Ni-BDT) and the Ni-BDT nanosheets after electrochemical activation (Ni-BDT-A). From the EXAFS spectra in Fig. 24c, the relatively low coordination number of Ni-Ni and similar Ni-Ni bond length with Ni foil verified the formation of ultrathin Ni nanosheets (Ni NSs). Meanwhile, the XPS analysis also revealed that the content of S in the electrocatalyst surface was greatly decreased after electrochemical activation and the Ni species detected were predominately Ni0 with only trace amount of Ni2+ coordinated by S [298]. Theoretical results\nNote: GCE, glassy carbon electrode.\ndemonstrated that Ni0 served as the actual catalytically active sites for hydrogen production, and very small amount of Sadδ- remaining on the Ni nanosheets surface promoted the formation of the Hads at the Ni0 sites via forming Sadδ--hydrated cation networks. The promotion effect imparts in-situ-generated ultrathin Ni NSs superior electrochemical performance toward the HER with a low overpotential of η10 = 80mV in 1.0M KOH (Fig. 24d).\nTo realize the stable HER electrocatalysis in all-pH range, carbon nanomaterials have been extensively used. In this respect, Co encapsulated nitrogen-rich carbon nanotubes (Co-NRCNTs) [306] and Co nanoparticles embedded into the interlamination of N-doped graphene (Co@NGF) [302] were successfully constructed to electrolyze water in acidic, neutral and basic media. Recently, a novel strategy was reported\nby F. Fang et al. to prepare ultrafine Co nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) grafted on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) surface (Co@N-CNTs@rGO) (Fig. 25) [305]. The unique 3D hierarchical architecture composed of 0D Co NPs, 1D NCNTs and 2D rGO, which endowed the Co@N-CNTs@rGO with more exposed active sites and enhanced mass transfer diffusion kinetics. The as-obtained hybrid electrocatalysts exhibited outstanding electrochemical activity toward HER with a low overpotential of η10 = 87mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and η10 = 108mV in 1.0 M KOH.\nTo enhance the electrocatalytic activity and atomic utility, successful strategies, downsizing the metal nanoparticles into isolated single atoms for more exposed active sites, are usually employed [315–317]. Isolated metal atoms demonstrate more electrocatalytically\nactive than others due to the low-coordination and unsaturated atoms containing valence electrons. But the surface free energy of metals increases remarkably as the particle size decreases, which would promote aggregation of small particles or clusters. Thus, using a suitable support material that strongly interacts with metal atoms to prevent this aggregation, and produces stable, finely dispersed metal atoms is a helpful method [63]. Lots of noble metal atoms, such as Pt [318–320], Au [321,322], and Pd [323,324], were supported on carbon nanomaterials for high electrocatalytic activity. A few studies about earth abundant transition metals were also conducted [325–327]. Among them, X. Yao et al. synthesized atomically isolated Ni species dispersed on graphitized carbon matrix through electrochemical activation [325]. The individual Ni atoms were anchored on the partially graphitized carbon. The activated-Ni-Carbon (A-Ni-C) electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of only η10 = 34mV in 0.5M H2SO4 was eventually obtained. Besides, Tour and co-workers reported isolated Co atoms dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-NG) via facile heat treatment with the\nassistance of NH3 atmosphere (Fig. 26a) [326]. As shown in Fig. 26b-d, the STEM images demonstrated the defective structures of the graphitic carbon support and the size of these bright dots is in the range of 2–3 Å. Based on the EXAFS analysis in Fig. 26f, no observed Co-Co interaction appeared in Co-NG, otherwise Co-N bond was detected. These results confirm that the light spot corresponds to isolated Co atoms, and the Co atoms were anchored on graphene surface by the bonding with nitrogen. Compared with the wavelet transform contour plots of Co-G in Fig. 26e, there was a small shift on the location of the maximum occurred on Co-NG, suggesting the presence of Co-N bonding. As expected, this catalyst is robust and highly active in aqueous media with low overpotential (Fig. 26g). The trends observed so far were focused on implanting single metal atoms (Ni, Co etc.) in 2D platforms such as graphene, g-C3N4, etc. Nowadays, substituting isolated metal atoms in the lattice of another metal atom has been introduced as plausible approach to accelerate water dissociation kinetics. Li and co-workers successfully synthesized atomically dispersed Co into Ru nanosheets\nlattice as highly efficient HER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution [175]. Theoretical calculations indicated that single Co atom substitution in Ru lattice dramatically lower energy barrier of water decomposition. This electrocatalyst exhibited the superb HER performance in 1.0 M KOH (the overpotential of η10 = 13mV and Tafel slope of 29mV dec−1), far superior than mere of CoRu alloy."

      "text" : "Previous studies have suggested that a combination of two or more non-noble metals from the two branches of the volcano curve (Fig. 4) could give rise to the enhancement in electrocatalytic activity [76,78,243,307,328–331]. The incorporation of other transition metals can modify the lattice parameters and electron density states of the metal catalyst to change the adsorption energies on the metal surface toward the optimal electrocatalytic activity [75,303,332,333]. Some recent advances also confirmed the remarkable electrochemical activity of binary and ternary alloys for hydrogen gas [307,309,334]. It is impressive that alloying nickel with other non-noble metals (e.g., Mo, W, Co etc.) have been commercialized as the cathodes for water electrolysis arising from their low cost, tunable electrocatalytic activity, favorable electrical conductivity, and excellent anti-corrosion capability [297,307,334–337]. Especially, Ni-Mo alloys [73,74,243,328,338,339] have been reported as the most active electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline electrolytes arising from the interaction between Ni and Mo via the d-orbital electron transfer, which made its surface electronic state similar to precious metal Pt. X. Sun and co-workers successfully synthesized ultrathin Ni-Mo alloy nanosheets by reducing the NiMoO4 nanosheets array precursors under gentle conditions [309]. Benefiting from its ultrathin nanostructure and tailored composition, the as-obtained Ni-Mo nanosheets exhibited electrocatalytic activity almost similar with that of commercial Pt/C, requiring an overpotential of only η10 = 35mV and Tafel slope of 45mV dec−1 in 1M KOH. Later, Feng et al. developed a highly active and stable MoNi4 electrocatalyst\nsupported by MoO2 cuboids on nickel foam (MoNi4/MoO2@Ni), which was constructed by controlling the outward diffusion of Ni atoms on annealing NiMoO4 precursor in H2/Ar mixed atmosphere at 500 °C [73]. Fig. 27a-c reveals the SEM and HRTEM images of the heterostructured cuboids. The theoretical calculations revealed that the role of NiMoO4 is the actual active center and can largely reduce energy barrier of the Volmer step (Fig. 27d). As a result, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibited superb electrocatalytic performance for HER, requiring zero onset overpotential and overpotential of only η10 = 15mV, as well as a low Tafel slope of 30mV dec−1 in alkaline electrolytes (Fig. 27e-f). Very recently, Adschiri et al. reported the synthesis of a porous Ni-Mo alloy covered by nanohole-sized holey nitrogen-doped graphene layers for HER in acidic electrolyte [307]. The nanohole fringes of the holey graphene enhance electrochemical activity and electrochemical stability.\nWhat’s more, the multi-metal alloys are also considered and studied. In this regard, F. Besenbacher et al. reported a composition-controlled Ni-Mo-Zn ternary alloy electrocatalyst via electrochemical deposition method [329]. Optimum amount (1–3 at%) of Zn was added to Ni-Mo in order to boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity of the electrocatalyst and efficiently facilitate the mass/electron transfer process. And Q. Chen et al. developed a universal method for synthesizing FeCo-Ni ternary alloys encapsulated in N-doped graphene via direct annealing of different MOFs [336]. They found that the variation of metal proportion in alloy would change the number of transferred electrons between alloy and graphene and the degree of freedom of alloys could affect their electrocatalytic properties."

      "text" : "In conclusion, continuing breakthroughs have been achieved for constructing non-noble metal based electrocatalysts beyond TMDs toward efficient electrochemical HER process in past few years. Experimental and theoretical works conducted so far in this particular\nfield reveal that the performance of a given catalyst depends on the extent of exposing active sites on the surface. In this context, the design of nanostructured materials finds a promising way for excellent performance in activity, stability and selectivity toward a given reaction. Moreover, catalysts should also be built from elementally abundant and less expensive materials for a wide-spread application. Maximal exposure of active sites based on entirely Earth abundant elements with controllability and large-area uniformity is an essential requirement for practical applications. This greatly depends on the development of facile and reliable synthesis methods; and (of course) adequate characterization tools. Tables 2–8 show different kinds of electrocatalysts based on transition metal phosphides (TMPs), carbides (TMCs), nitrides (TMNs), borides (TMBs), oxides (TMOs) and pure non-precious metal electrocatalysts for generating hydrogen gas. Inspired by the superior catalytic activity of platinum and the bio-enzymes, the prediction and regulation of HER electrocatalysts focus on resembling their electronic structure with that of platinum and active sites of bio-enzyme via DFT simulations and calculations. To this end, some experimental approaches, e.g., heteroatom doping, constructing heterostructures etc. were widely welcomed. Unfortunately, few studies have concentrated on the exploration and systematically understanding the intrinsic catalytic activity of these materials on atomic-scale level, which have been accomplished on Pt surface.\nUnder this condition, more attention should be devoted to gain further insight into these non-noble metal based electrocatalyst for a HER process. i) Some in-situ techniques, for example in-situ Raman and X-ray absorption spectra, should be developed to probe the interfacial structure and reconstructed surface during the electrochemical HER measurements. Notably, these novel techniques are powerful tool to detect the active sites experimentally. In this regard, the commonly employed electrolytes, including acidic, neutral and alkaline solution, also make a non-negligible difference owing to the existence of various intermediates (H3O+ or H2O). For effectively realizing the establishment of HER routes on these non-noble metal based materials, the exposed facet and crystal structure have to be controlled. ii) Relying on the DFT calculations and in-situ experimental results, the reasonable models, which are closer to the real reaction systems, should be built to predict the reaction intermediates and HER mechanism on these electrocatalysts. Such fundamental understandings will be helpful for designing and optimizing these catalysts with more efficiency, as well as establishing structure-reactivity relationship on them. iii) From the perspective of practical application, the development of efficient HER electrocatalyst utilized in given electrolyte should be carefully considered. After comparing the catalytic activity of various materials in electrochemical hydrogen evolution, it is easy to find that the TMPs, TMCs, TMNs and TMBs are active and stable electrocatalysts for HER in a wide pH range. While, TMOs are usually used in alkaline electrolyte. iv) To integrate HER devices into other renewable power resource, such as solar energy, wind energy or tidal energy, careful design of setup configuration will have a profound industrial application value."

Hydrogen gas, as the potential alternative for the future energy supply, is now considered as the primary choice. Recently, with the assistance of the non-noble metal based compounds, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution has aroused tremendous attention. In particular, earth abundant materials beyond transition metal dichalcogenides, such as transition metal phosphides, carbides, nitrides, demonstrate highly active and efficient activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under different conditions. In this review, focused on these materials, we systemically discuss their recent development in electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. The synthesis routes utilized to prepare superior and specific catalyst are highlighted. Then, we provide insight into the characterization and electrochemical performance of these materials as HER electrocatalysts. In the end, the challenges of these materials, important issues about studying eletablctrocatalysts and future perspectives are stressed.",
