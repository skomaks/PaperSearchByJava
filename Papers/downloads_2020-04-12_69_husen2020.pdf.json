      "text" : "Global population is rapidly increasing and requires a substantial increase (around 70%) in agricultural productivity for an additional 2.3 billion people by 2050 (Tilman et al., 2011). Modern agriculture practice and sustainable productivity of crops entirely depend on the new and innovative techniques. In recent years, application of nanotechnology for the enhancement of agricultural crops production has shown a great promise (Rico et al., 2011; Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a,b; Servin and White, 2016; Mishra et al., 2017; Rizwan et al., 2017; Iavicoli et al., 2017; Baker et al., 2017). Nanotechnology deals with materials at nanoscale level. Particle size less than 100 nm in at least one dimension are termed as nanomaterials (NMs). Demand and production of NMs are increasing; and thus their availability in air, soil, and water system is also increasing. Besides agricultural sectors, these particles have several other applications in almost all spheres of human life (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a,b; Siddiqi et al., 2018a,b).\nNanomaterials for Agriculture and Forestry Applications. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-817852-2.00007-X © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 167\nA variety of NMs such as carbon-based (single-walled and multiwalled carbon nanotubes, etc.), metal and/or metal oxides based are developed to check their influence on agricultural crops production and protection. Interaction of NMs with agricultural crops often leads to their accumulation in various food sources (Rico et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2015; Siddiqi and Husen, 2016, 2017a,b; Rizwan et al., 2017). NMs have shown both beneficial (growth promotive) and toxic effects on agricultural crops. Thus far, Batley et al. (2013) have reported that the concentration and/or accumulation of NMs are less in the surrounding environment. But at the same time, several reports on crop species have shown their accumulation, transportation, and possibility of NMs to enter into food system (Zhu et al., 2008; Rico et al., 2011; Husen and Iqbal, 2019).\nMost of the researchers have examined the effect of NMs concentration of metal and metal oxide (type and source) on such parameters as duration of exposure, seed germination, morphological traits, biomass production, physiological, and biochemical (enzymatic and nonenzymatic components) characteristics in different crop species (Rico et al., 2011; Husen and Siddiqi, 2014b; Siddiqi and Husen, 2016, 2017a,b; Rizwan et al., 2017; Pullagurala et al., 2018; Suriyaprabha et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2018; Hao et al., 2019). In addition, few investigations associated with the effects of NMs at molecular level have also been made (Kaveh et al., 2013; Nair and Chung, 2014a,b; Fouad and Hafez, 2018; Gupta et al., 2018) (Fig. 7.1).\nPossible interactions of metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials (NMs) with agricultural crops.\n168 CHAPTER 7 Interactions of metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials\nCrop species response to NMs toxicity (growth retardation and other harmful effects) is a key discipline of investigation (Lin and Xing, 2008; Lee et al., 2008; López-Moreno et al., 2010a; Rao and Shekhawat, 2016; Husen and Iqbal, 2019). It has been reported that the crop toxicity mainly depends on the concentration, exposure time, growth media, shape, and size of NMs (Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a, b; Husen and Iqbal, 2019; Wagay et al., 2019; Raffi and Husen, 2019). Toxicity mechanism usually consists of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which diminished antioxidant enzyme activities. NMs exposure to some crop species has shown significant changes in the antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; peroxidase, POD; ascorbate peroxidase, APX; glutathione reductase, GR, etc.), low molecular weight antioxidants (ascorbate, proline, carotenoids, etc.), nonenzymatic components (carotenoids, ascorbate, tocopherol, etc.), and the up-regulation of heat-shock proteins (hsps) (Zhao et al., 2012a; Burman et al., 2013; Rao and Shekhawat, 2016; Da Costa and Sharma, 2016; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a,b; Juárez-Maldonado et al., 2018). These components reduced the oxidative damage during NMs treatment. Reports have also shown that NMs exposure in some crop species accelerates free-radical scavenging potential and antioxidant enzymes performance. They also alter micro RNAs (mRNAs) expression which control morpho-physiological features and metabolic activities (Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a,b). However, in some studies, free metal ion toxicity has also been observed to be greater in comparison to the NMs. For example, silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are less toxic to plants in comparison to the silver ions (Gubbins et al., 2011) mainly due to greater solubility of AgNO3 and greater mobility of silver ions in aqueous medium. Moreover, constant NMs accumulation/deposition in soil leads to physical damage to roots, owing to adsorption of NMs on the surface of root. They also affect soil microbial communities, and therefore influence the growth of crop species. In general, different crop species have evolved antioxidant defense mechanism to avoid oxidative damage and improve resistance to toxicity caused by the NMs. However, these responses must be verified to understand the mechanism of action. In addition, the fate of these NMs in the food chain/ecosystem is of great concern. Overall, the beneficial claim of NMs requires confirmation.\nThis chapter precisely elaborates the effect of metal and metal-oxide NMs on the agricultural crops. General mechanism of interaction and associated factors in relation to morpho-physiological and biochemical response at molecular levels have also been highlighted. In addition, some key points are also raised on the existing observations, current challenges, and future research directions."

      "heading" : "7.2 Nanomaterials exposure, uptake, and translocation",
      "text" : "Like other higher plants, mineral absorption by agricultural crops is nonselective. Some metal ions in conjunction with anions may produce crop toxicity once they\n1697.2 Nanomaterials exposure, uptake, and translocation\nsurpass the tolerance limit. It has been demonstrated that NMs enter the crop plants either through soil/agar media or foliar exposure (Du et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012a,b; Husen and Siddiqi, 2014b; Husen and Iqbal, 2019). They are capable to enter living tissues and migrate to different parts of crop species. NMs may form a complex with carrier proteins. It is still not clear as to how some crops select NMs and others reject them. NMs can be accumulated at the root surface if their size is larger than the pore size of root. However, they may get absorbed and transported to other parts if they are smaller than the pores in roots. Some NMs are stored in the extracellular spaces and some inside the cell.\nBeattiew and Haverkamp (2011) examined the uptake of NMs in Brassica juncea, which was grown in hydroponic culture in the presence of HAuCl4 and AgNO3 separately. Various sections of B. juncea were cut and studied. From the X-ray absorption spectroscopy gold (Au) and Ag-NPs were found to be accumulated in leaves, stem, roots, and cell wall. Moreover, spherical Au-NPs and AgNPs of 2 100 nm were recorded. Au-NPs (6 10 nm) uptake and distribution in rice, radish, pumpkin, and perennial ryegrass have been also reported (Zhu et al., 2012). In this investigation, authors have suggested that the plant roots easily uptake the positively charged Au-NPs; however, the negatively charged Au-NPs are translocated to the shoots. Zhu et al. (2012) have proposed that uptake and distribution of particles depend on surface charge and plant species.\nIn an experiment with Arachis hypogaea, Deepa et al. (2014) has demonstrated that the foliar application of calcium oxide (CaO) NPs (69.9 mm in size) at concentrations of 10 1000 ppm, penetrated into leaves, stem, and roots via phloem in comparison to bulk sources of sprayed Ca (CaO and CaNO3). In aqueous medium and/or soil matrix, NMs pass through the symplastic and/or apoplastic region to enter the epidermis of roots. They pass through the cortex and eventually enter the stem and leaves via xylem and phloem (Corredor et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012). However, NMs uptake and translocation may vary from crop to crop, growth conditions, and growth media (Servin et al., 2012; Husen and Siddiqi, 2014b; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a,b). In Lycopersicon esculentum, uptake of various NPs was examined by Antisari et al. (2015). Authors have claimed that the metal from NPs was accrued in roots, while Ag, cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni) NPs-treated plants exhibited higher amounts of particles in both roots and shoots in comparison to control plants.\nWang et al. (2013) have studied the accumulation and translocation of zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs in Vigna unguiculate. They found that metals from NPs were accrued in roots; nonetheless, these particles were not translocated to the aerial parts of V. unguiculate. In Lolium perenne, ZnO-NPs adhered to the surface of root and were also found in the apoplast/protoplast of the root endodermis and stele (Lin and Xing, 2008).\nIn Oryza sativa, it has been reported that copper oxide (CuO) NPs reached the stele via lateral roots and translocated to leaves (Peng et al., 2015). In an experiment, CuO-NPs were translocated from roots to shoots in Zea mays through xylem and re-translocated from shoots to roots through phloem (Wang et al., 2012).\n170 CHAPTER 7 Interactions of metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials\nPerhaps, it is the first report that claimed transportation of CuO-NPs to the shoots and back to the roots via phloem.\nSchwabe et al. (2013) have examined the interaction and translocation of cerium oxide (CeO2) NP in hydroponically grown Triticum aestivum and Cucurbita maxima plants for 8 days (17 100 nm) at 100 mg L21 in the absence and presence of fulvic acid and gum arabic. It has been shown that CeO2-NPs were translocated in C. maxima shoot but not in T. aestivum. TEM and SEM studies revealed the deposition of NPs on the surface of root, which suggested that fulvic acid or gum arabic does not affect the translocation of CeO2-NPs; nonetheless, it facilitates in sticking them to the roots. It has been attributed to specific changes in root structure and its interaction with NPs in the presence of root exudates (Rico et al., 2011; Judy et al., 2012). Further, Rico et al. (2015) have shown that Hordeum vulgare could accumulate CeO2-NPs in their root tissues without affecting the rate of germination and elongation of root.\nDu et al. (2011) have demonstrated that ZnO and TiO2-NPs decreased the biomass production in T. aestivum. It has also been reported that the TiO2-NPs adhere to root tip cell wall of periderm cells, while ZnO-NPs dissolved in the soil, thus increasing the uptake of toxic Zn by T. aestivum. X-ray absorption spectroscopic investigation of Glycine max has shown the absence of ZnO-NPs in roots (López-Moreno et al., 2010a). However, confocal microscopic examination revealed the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-stained ZnO-NPs in the stele of Z. mays roots, though these particles were not found in the shoots (Zhao et al., 2012b). It indicated the absorption and accumulation of ZnO-NPs in plant system.\nThe effect of anatase and rutile TiO2 on the development and germination of T. aestivum for about 7 days was examined by Larue et al. (2012). It was found that TiO2-NPs of diameter less than 140 nm are accumulated in T. aestivum roots. They are translocated to leaves if their diameter is smaller than 36 nm even if it is below the detection limit. These particles neither dissolve nor their crystal phase undergo any change during translocation. It has also been reported that 14 and 22 nm TiO2-NPs treatment increased elongation of root without influencing germination of seed, growth attributes, photosynthesis, or redox reaction in T. aestivum seedlings.\nLopez-Moreno et al. (2010b) have reported that CeO2-NPs of 7 nm were taken up into Cucumis sativus, L. esculentum, Medicago sativa, and Z. mays seedlings at concentrations of up to 4000 mg L21. CeO2-NPs of 7 25 nm were observed to be translocated to C. sativus shoots. Wang et al. (2011) found that the magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs were unable to translocate in the Lolium perenne and Cucurbita mixta plants. Recently, Hu et al. (2017) reported uptake of iron oxide (Fe2O3) NPs in Citrus maxima roots, but no translocation from roots to shoots was recorded.\nIt is clear that NMs uptake, accumulation, and translocation in crop species depend on their physical and chemical properties. Additionally, their accumulation and translocation advocate their nonbiodegradable nature. Long-term deposition of NMs possibly affects the entire system of crops. These particles may reach other living beings via food chain as has been shown in Fig. 7.2.\n1717.2 Nanomaterials exposure, uptake, and translocation\nUptake, accumulation, and translocation of metal ion and metal oxide in crops need further confirmation. Thus far, limited reports are available, and the precise nature and transport mechanism of NMs is not clearly understood."

      "text" : "Different metals (silver, gold, copper, aluminum, silica, zinc, etc.) and metaloxides (zinc oxide, cerium oxide, titanium oxide, silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, etc.) NMs have been produced via physical, chemical, or biological routes (Iravani et al., 2014; Husen and Siddiqi, 2014b; Siddiqi et al., 2016; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a,b). NMs exposure to different crop species had shown both inhibitory and stimulatory effects (Husen and Siddiqi, 2014a,b; Siddiqi and Husen, 2016, 2017a,b; Salem et al., 2016; Mehrian et al., 2016; Venkatachalam et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018; Suriyaprabha et al., 2018).\nIn the following sub-section, major interaction of NMs in terms of some growth/developmental traits (germination of seed, shoot/root growth, leaf production, biomass, and yield characteristics), physiological features (mainly photosynthetic efficiency, photochemical fluorescence, and quantum yield), biochemical processes (enzymatic and nonenzymatic components) and response at molecular\nPossible interaction of nanomaterials with soil and agricultural crops, and their invasion in food chain or ecosystem.\n172 CHAPTER 7 Interactions of metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials\nlevels are described.

      "text" : "Foliar exposure of Au-NPs in B. juncea has shown remarkable variation in both growth (height, stem diameter, number of leaves, number of branches, and number of pods) and seed yield (Arora et al., 2012). It has been suggested that the exposure of Au-NPs improved the redox status of the treated seedlings. Seed germination percentage was increased when seedlings were exposed to 25 ppm Au-NPs. With increasing dose of Au-NPs the rate of germination decreases. Arora et al. (2012) have reported that the antagonistic effect of Au-NPs decreased the influence of ethylene; thus, an increase in the number of leaves was recorded. In fact, it is not the antagonism of Au-NPs but the complexation of ethylene with Au or adsorption of ethylene on Au-NPs. About 19% increase in seed production was recorded in this investigation after 10 ppm Au-NPs foliar spray. Further, like CuONPs in T. aestivum (Zhou et al., 2011), Au-NPs was also accumulated in B. juncea. Spherical Au-NPs (2 19 nm in size) were examined for H. vulgare seed germination (Feichtmeier et al., 2015). Insignificant variation was observed on seed germination; however, yellowing of leaves, darkening of roots, and reduced biomass were recorded which have further deteriorated with increasing dose of Au-NPs. Au-NPs application have also shown a remarkable morphological alteration on the root tips of H. vulgare. The epidermis was fragmented and the cortical cells distorted. TEM studies have also displayed the uptake of Au-NPs of 18 nm diameter showing their accumulation in the root. Feichtmeier et al. (2015) reported that the lowest dose of Au-NPs (1 µg mL21) in the nutrient medium had a growth promotive effect. Perhaps, lower dose of Au-NPs stimulates hormone function (Barrena et al., 2009), but higher dose and larger NPs adversely affected overall crop growth and biomass production. In addition, adsorption of Au-NPs onto the cell wall surfaces of the primary root system diminished the pore size, reducing water transport. As a result of this, crop growth is reduced (Asli and Neumann, 2009). Crop growth retardation under water stress has also been reported (Husen et al., 2014, 2017; Getnet et al., 2015; Embiale et al., 2016).\nA. hypogaea seedlings were examined for their yield, quality, physiological, and biochemical response in the amended sandy soil with various concentration of Ag-NPs (50, 500, and 2000 mg kg21) for 98 days (Rui et al., 2017). All growth associated parameters (plant height, biomass, grain weight, and yield) were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. It has been found that the chemically synthesized Ag-NPs decreased shoot/root growth and increased oxidative stress and damage in Oryza sativa (Mazumdar and Ahmed, 2011; Mirzajani et al., 2013, 2014; Nair and Chung, 2014a; Thuesombat et al., 2014). Response of seed germination and seedling growth of O. sativa with green-synthesized Ag-NPs (18.16 nm) were also studied in vitro at various concentrations (10, 20, 40 ppm) (Gupta et al., 2018). At all concentrations, biogenic-synthesized Ag-NPs\n1737.3 Interactions of metal/metal-oxide nanomaterials with crop species\nSong et al.

Positive response was noted in this investigation due to the greater biocompatibility of Ag-NPs.\nTreatment of CeO2-NPs at 800 mg kg 21 reduced Cucumis sativus yield by 31.6% (Zhao et al., 2013); Ag-NPs at 1000 mg L21 reduced Lycopersicon esculentum yield by 60.10% (Song et al., 2013); ZnO-NPs at 2000 mg L21 reduced A. hypogaea yield by 7.6% (Prasad et al., 2012) in comparison to control plants. In a recent study, Jahani et al. (2019) have reported that in Calendula officinalis, the growth parameters (shoot length and biomass) and chlorophyll contents were increased at the lower concentrations of CeO2-NPs (50 and 100 mg L 21) and decreased at higher doses. CuO-NPs have shown no response on seed germination of Z. mays (Wang et al., 2012). Further, it decreased growth traits and increased chlorosis of Z. mays seedlings at the dose of 100 mg L21 CuO-NPs. However, in some investigation, TiO2- and SiO2-NPs increased both the germination and growth of Glycine max seeds (Lu et al., 2002). The ZnO-NPs have been used as growth promoter for Cicer arietinum and Vigna radiata seedlings (Mahajan et al., 2011). Authors have reported that in V. radiata the elongation of root occurs at 1 ppm level of ZnO-NPs, whereas the shoot growth was unaffected when seedlings were exposed for 60 h. Once the concentration of ZnO-NPs exceeded from 1 to 20 ppm, decreased shoot and root growth were recorded in both species which has been proposed to be a toxic dose. It was noted that ZnO-NPs were absorbed and translocated to other parts of the crop species. Moreover, dispersion of epidermis, cortex, and vascular cylinder were noted at higher dose of ZnONPs. ZnO-NPs adsorption and aggregation in the root and injury to the root architecture were observed when a quantity above the optimum concentration was given. All NMs irrespective of their nature have shown some response to certain growth traits, although in some cases, it is not economically feasible to use. For instance, use of Au and or Ag-NPs is not profitable in terms of cost; however, it is an effort toward a bright future for augmented food crop production with the use of some engineered NMs."

      "text" : "Physiological traits such as photosynthetic efficiency, maximal quantum yield of PSII considered as chlorophyll fluorescence (maximum quantum yield Fv/Fm) have been used as a significant parameter to examine the impact of NMs-induced toxicity in crops. Usually, it has been suggested that the higher dose of NMs affects the photosynthesis, which may result in crop growth suppression or death (Perreault et al., 2014; Da Costa and Sharma, 2016). In O. sativa, increasing concentration of CuO-NPs (0, 2.5, 10, 50, 100, and 1000 mg L21) adversely affected seedling growth in a hydroponic system (Da Costa and Sharma, 2016). A dosedependent decline in photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, and photosynthetic pigment contents, with a complete loss of PSII photochemical quenching at 1000 mg L21 has\n184 CHAPTER 7 Interactions of metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials\nbeen reported. In H. vulgare, Shaw et al. (2014) have reported that CuO-NPs decreased shoot and root growth of seedlings with passage of time in a concentration-dependent manner. However, insignificant changes in the Fv/Fm ratio were recorded. In addition, Shaw et al. (2014) have also suggested that CuO-NPs induced the release of ROS, membrane damage, and enzymatic activities, which was not sufficient to cope with the stress at 20-day exposure. ZnONPs inhibited the expression of genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis and photosystem structure (Wang et al., 2016). CuO-NPs accumulation in the chloroplasts was accompanied by a lower number of thylakoids per granum (Da Costa and Sharma, 2016). In addition, Jiang et al. (2017) have reported that AgNPs inhibited ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) activity and the photo-protective capacity of PSII in Spirodela polyrhiza. However, some studies have suggested that the metal oxide, for instance, the nano-TiO2 can improve light absorbance and promote the activity of Rubisco, and hence accelerated growth rate of spinach plants (Hong et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2008; Linglan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008; Su et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2006).\nIn an experiment, Tripathi et al. (2017a) reported that ZnO-NP reduced photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant activity, but it induced ROS production in T. aestivum. However, Faizan et al. (2018) have reported that treatment of 8 mg L21 ZnO-NPs for 30 min increased antioxidant enzymes activities, proline accumulation, and photosynthetic rate in L. esculentum seedlings. In another experiment, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated and uncoated CeO2-NPs at different doses (0, 10, 100, and 500 mg kg21 dry soil) were examined in G. max plants (Cao et al., 2017). Both types of particles increased G. max growth and also increased the photosynthesis rate by 54% for uncoated CeO2-NPs and by 36% for PVP-CeO2-NPs at the dose of 100 mg kg 21. Rubisco carboxylase activity also increased upto 32% for uncoated CeO2-NPs and by 27% for PVP-CeO2-NPs, for bare and PVP-coated CeO2-NPs at the dose of 100 mg kg 21 during the 3-week treatment. However, rate of photosynthesis declined by 36% for both types of NPs at 500 mg kg21 CeO2-NPs. Moreover, at dose .500 mg kg 21 CeO2-NPs also reduced Rubisco activity and affected CO2 diffusion pathways. Authors have suggested that the physiological influence of CeO2-NPs responded in a concentration-dependent manner and also to the surface coating properties of the NPs. However, Zhao et al. (2012a) have examined Z. mays response in the amended soil of CeO2-NPs at 400 or 800 mg kg 21 and did not find any significant change in the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration, and stomatal conductance. Response of Capsicum annum in amended soil with nano CuO, bulk CuO, and an ionic copper at 0, 125, 250, and 500 mg kg21 was investigated (Rawat et al., 2018). They showed an insignificant variation on growth traits, chlorophyll content, and fruit productivity. Ionic copper remarkably decreased evapotranspiration by 41%, stomatal conductance by 59% and photosynthesis by 38% in comparison to the other treatments at the selected doses.\n1857.3 Interactions of metal/metal-oxide nanomaterials with crop species"

      "heading" : "7.3.3 Biochemical and molecular response",
      "text" : "Certain crop species may not exhibit any growth alterations, though noticeable differences in antioxidant enzyme activities, up-regulation of hsps, and expression levels of different genes have been reported occasionally (Siddiqi and Husen, 2016). Crop species response to heavy metals and/or NMs stresses usually induced ROS production and caused oxidative damage to crops via electron transfer; induced ROS includes singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide (O 2 2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (HO•) (Iqbal et al., 2015; Siddiqi and Husen, 2017a,b). Several studies have been conducted to see the role of antioxidant in scavenging ROS and defending NMs-induced oxidative stress in the crop species. For instance, Rui et al. (2017) examined the role of Ag-NPs (50, 500, and 2000 mg kg21) on the antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, and CAT) in A. hypogaea roots and pods. A dose-dependent increase in all enzymatic activities was noted. NMs-induced oxidative stress reveals crop species toxicity in terms of lipid peroxidation, cell membrane, and DNA damage, leading to cell death (Sayes et al., 2005; Xia et al., 2006; Hsin et al., 2008). In the leaves of O. sativa, ZnONPs treatment at 750 mg L21 increased the SOD, POD, and CAT activities (Salah et al., 2015). In L. esculentum, Ag-NPs at 1000 mg L21 increased the SOD activity (Song et al., 2013). Ma et al. (2016) also found increased activities of SOD, CAT, and POD activities in CeO2 and In2O3-NPs treated Arabidopsis thaliana in comparison to control plants. Tripathi et al. (2017b) have demonstrated that nitric oxide protected seedlings of Pisum sativum from adverse effects of Ag-NPs on growth parameters and photosynthesis by controlling the Ag accumulation, ROS, and antioxidant defense system. Gupta et al. (2018) have reported that biogenic Ag-NPs treatment stimulated growth in O. sativa, which was supported by a low amount of ROS concomitant with reduced concentration of lipid peroxidation and the amount of H2O2. Elevated antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APX, and GR) were also noted in Ag-NPs treated seedling of O. sativa. They have suggested that enzymes associated with the ascorbate cycle (APX and GR) were more active toward protection against oxidative damage than SOD. They have noted the pattern of ROS-associated gene expression of Ag-NPs treated seedling, which responded in a dose-dependent manner (10, 20, 40 ppm). They have reported upregulation of CAT and APX gene expressions in Ag-NPs treated plants, whereas a decrease in the level of CuZnSOD gene expression with increasing the dose of Ag-NPs treatments was observed. Insignificant variation in SOD activity was noted at lower dose of 10 ppm, but SOD activity was increased at higher doses of Ag-NPs. In addition, a discrepancy in SOD gene expression was also noted. Inconsistence response of SOD gene expression and SOD activity exhibited that the changes in the enzymatic activity were not affected by mRNA levels. They were, however, controlled at the posttranscriptional level because Ag-NPs might have induced enzyme activity.\nNair and Chung (2014a) have studied 1-week exposure of O. sativa seedlings to different concentrations of Ag-NPs (0, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg L21). A decrease in\n186 CHAPTER 7 Interactions of metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials\nroot growth, shoot and root fresh weights, total chlorophyll and carotenoids in a dose-dependent manner was observed. Ag-NPs treatment (0.5 and 1 mg L21) was responsible for increase in lipid peroxidation and H2O2 production in shoots/roots increased foliar proline accumulation and decreased sugar contents. Ag-NPs treatment increased ROS and produced cytotoxicity which is shown by increased dihydroethidium, 30-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein, and propidium iodide fluorescence. Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential was noted due to increased dose of Ag-NPs treatments in roots. Expression level of different SOD genes (FSD, MSD1, and CSD1) exhibited a remarkable induction under various doses of Ag-NPs. Up-regulation of CAT, APXa, and APXb genes were also reported in this investigation (Nair and Chung, 2014a).\nBurklew et al. (2012) have investigated the response of Nicotiana tabacum under various concentrations of Al2O3-NPs (0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%). Tobacco root length and biomass increased, but the number of leaves decreased. At higher concentration, the expression of microRNA (miRNA), namely miR395, miR397, miR398, and miR399, were increased. The miRNAs perhaps alleviate the stress due to the Al2O3-NPs exposure. Frazier et al. (2014) have also reported that lower doses (0.1% and 1%) of TiO2-NPs induced miRNA expression in N. tabacum seedlings with miR395 285-fold and miR399 143-fold. Zhao et al. (2012a) have shown that in Z. mays, CeO2-NP exposure enhanced H2O2 accumulation, up to 15 days, in phloem, xylem, bundle sheath cells, and epidermal cells of shoots. Antioxidant enzymatic activities, namely CAT and APX, were also enhanced concomitant with the H2O2 levels. Exposure of 400 and 800 mg kg 21 CeO2-NPs accelerated up-regulation of the hsp70 in roots, indicating a systemic stress response. It was suggested that the CAT, APX, and hsp70 perhaps facilitate Z. mays to defend against CeO2-NPs induced oxidative damage and survival under NMs exposure.\n7.4 Conclusion\nIn this chapter, current understanding of agricultural crops response to metal and or metal-oxide NMs was presented. Several changes have been observed (beneficial/negative as well as increase/decrease in the studied parameters) in agricultural crops due to exposure of metal and/or metal-oxide NMs (for reference see Tables 7.1 and 7.2). These particles are absorbed through root or foliar exposure and subsequently translocated and stored in tissues. All these processes are dependent on shape and size of NMs, exposure time, and various crop species. Foliar exposure of NMs and their interaction with cellular activities, especially the photosynthetic components or system in leaf, need to be examined in detail as their accumulation may influence the leaf enzymatic machineries. In addition, constant NMs accumulation and deposition in soil may also affect soil microbial communities and thus the entire root functions. Overall, the increasing concentration of\n1877.4 Conclusion\nNMs in the soil environment may create a serious impact on agriculture crops in future. Therefore, a system-level approach is highly desirable to examine the overall impact of NMs on the complete performance of some important agricultural crops, soil ecosystem, rhizospheric microorganisms, and human health."
