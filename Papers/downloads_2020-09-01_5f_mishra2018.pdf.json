      "text" : "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) emerged in 1991 with the objective to provide biocompatibility, storage stability and to prevent the incorporated drug from degradation [1]. SLNs, colloidal carriers of nanoscopic size (50–1000 nm), made up of solid lipids (high melting fat matrix), are developed to conquer the weaknesses (e.g., polymer degradation and cytotoxicity, lack of a suitable large scale production method, inferior stability, drug leakage and fusion, phospholipid degradation, high production cost, and sterilization problems) of traditional colloidal carriers, like polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes [2]. SLNs show various distinctive features such as low toxicity, large surface area, prolonged drug release, superior cellular uptake as compared to traditional colloidal carriers as well as capability to improve solubility and bioavailability of drugs [3,4]. The release of drug from SLNs depends on matrix type and drug location in the formulation. The SLNs fabricated from biodegradable and biocompatible ingredients are able to incorporate both hydrophilic and lipophilic bioactives and thus turning out to be a viable option for controlled and targeted drug delivery [4,5]. The solid core of SLNs is hydrophobic with a monolayer coating of phospholipids and the drug is usually dispersed or dissolved in the core (Figure 1) [5–7].\nPharmaceutics 2018, 10, 191; doi:10.3390/pharmaceutics10040191 www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2018, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 21\n• The cells of reticuloendothelial system (RES) are unable to take up SLNs because of their nanosize range, thus enabling them to bypass spleen and liver filtration [8,9] • Provide high stability to incorporated drugs • Feasibility of incorporating both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs • Improve bioavailability of poorly water soluble molecules • Ease in sterilization and scale up • Immobilizing drug molecules within solid lipids provides protection from photochemical, oxidative, and chemical degradation of sensitive drugs, with reduced chances of drug leakage • Drying by lyophilization is achievable • Provide opportunities for targeted and controlled release of drug • Biocompatible and biodegradable compositional ingredients [4]\n1.2. Disadvantages of SLNs\n• SLNs are compactly packed lipid matrix networks (ideal crystalline structure) having low space for drug encapsulation, leading to poor drug loading capacity [10–13] • Various factors affect the loading or encapsulation of drugs in SLNs, such as interaction of drug and lipid melt, nature or state of lipid matrix, drug miscibility with lipid matrix, and the drug being dispersed or dissolved in the lipid matrix • Chances of drug expulsion following polymeric transition during storage [14,15] • The dispersions have a high (70–90%) water content [16]\n1.3. Nanostructured Lipid Carriers\nNanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are developed to conquer the difficulties of SLNs like drug expulsion and low drug loading, as NLCs are prepared from solid and liquid lipid mixture having non-ideal crystalline structure and prevent drug expulsion by avoiding crystallization of lipids [3]. NLCs consist of different spatial lipids (e.g., glycerides) and thus provide a larger distance between the glycerides’ fatty acid chains and general unstructured crystal; and consequently, promote higher drug accommodation. NLCs can be of three different types, viz. imperfect type, multiple type, and amorphous type [16]."

NLCs can be of three different types, viz. imperfect type, multiple type, and amorphous type [16].\n• Imperfect type NLCs are prepared by mixing of solid lipids with small amounts of oils (liquid lipids) and thus demonstrate high drug loading. • In multiple type NLCs, the amount of oily lipids are higher, and therefore yields high drug solubility as compared to solid lipids-. The reason of this phenomenon is based on the fact that the solubility of lipophilic drugs in solid lipids are lower than the liquid lipids (oils). • Amorphous type NLCs contain additional specific lipids e.g., isopropyl myristate, hydroxyl octacosanyl, hydroxyl stearate etc. to avoid crystallization of solid lipid upon cooling. Thus, expulsion of drug caused by crystallization of solid lipids could be prevented by amorphous type NLCs [16].\nNLCs have many advantages like: (a) dispersions of NLC by more solid content can be produced, (b) high capacity of drug-loading as compared to SLNs, (c) modulating drug release profile can be achieved with ease, (d) leakage of drug during storage is less than SLNs, and (e) production of final dosage formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules) is feasible [17]."

However, highly potent hydrophilic drugs in low dose can suitably be incorporated in solid lipid matrix. To overcome this difficulty, lipid drug conjugates (LDCs) were utilized, which displayed improvement in drug loading capacities of SLN up to 33%. To produce LDC, first, insoluble drug-lipid conjugate bulk is prepared by salt formation or via covalent linking. Then, it is processed with an aqueous surfactant solution (e.g., Tweens) to prepare nanoparticles by high-pressure homogenization technique. These types of matrices have shown potential in brain targeting of hydrophilic drugs in adverse protozoal infections [18]."

This apparatus is placed in an electric thermostated jacket. SLNs are formed by dispersing the warm microemulsion into an ice-cooled capsule containing water. The water is stirred by a cylindrical magnetic bar at a fixed rate (300 rpm). • The microemulsion drops from the needle in the center of the capsule (ice-cooled). The SLN dispersion is stirred for additional 15 min after the widespread microemulsion dripping.\nThe process factors such as pressure applied to the pneumatic cylinder, needle gauge, temperature of the aluminium chamber, and volume of dispersing water primarily affect the particle size and PDI of SLNs. A temperature difference between warm microemulsion and cold dispersing water plays an important role on the resulting size of the produced SLNs. A rapid crystallization of the oil droplets of the warm microemulsion during quenching favors the formation of small SLNs and avoids coalescence. By the use of a small needle, as well as high pressure and temperature, the SLNs with diameter of about 26 nm, and PDI of 0.1 were obtained [34]. Gohla and Dingler standardized a scaling and production method to manufacture drug free and drug loaded SLNs on medium scale. SLN batches of 2–10 kg were produced by high pressure homogenization technique using a modified Lab 60 device by discontinuous mode. For 50 kg batches, a continuous production mode was used by combining two homogenizers in series. A Gaulin 5.5 device was chosen as first homogenizer to transport the SLN dispersion into the Lab 60 device as a second homogenizer. Homogenization at 500 bar pressure was found to be the ideal pressure condition with 2–3 cycles. The authors demonstrated that production of SLNs can be easily scaled up to industrial scale [3,35]."

Drug Loading into SLNs\nCurrently, the fabrication strategy of lipid nanocarriers for controlled and stimuli-responsive drug release has raised research attention for overcoming the problems associated with poorly soluble and toxic drugs. There are mainly three drug incorporation models valid for SLNs: Homogenous matrix model, Drug enriched shell-core shell model, and Drug enriched core-core shell model (Figure 6) [36–38].\nFigure 6. Models of incorporation of active compounds into SLN.\nIn homogenous matrix model, the core may consist of drug in either amorphous clusters or molecularly dispersed phase. This model is usually observed when highly lipophilic drugs are incorporated into SLN either by application of hot or cold homogenization method. In drug enriched shell model, drug is available near the shell, thus yielding a drug free lipid core. A phase separation occurs when the solution is cooled and lipid precipitates out leading to drug free lipid core. During the same period, the drug re-partitions into the remaining liquid-lipid phase and drug gradually increases its concentration in the outer shell of the lipid core. A drug-enriched core can be formulated by liquefying drug in the lipid to its saturation solubility whereby a nanoemulsion is formed. Supersaturation of the drug in lipid melt occurs during the cooling of the nanoemulsion and causes precipitation of the drug before the precipitation of lipid. Further cooling will lead not only to drug but also lipid precipitation surrounding the drug precipitation, which will act as a membrane towards incorporated drug [39].\n7.2. Drug Release from SLNs\nFor any formulation, the drug release mechanism is of utmost importance. Drug release from SLNs is attributed by degradation, erosion, or diffusion. The release mechanism of drug from SLN matrix depends on the lipid and its composition. In SLN, drug is either embedded in the matrix or on the surface, and such a system can show versatile release or dual release (immediate release with sustained release). Drug adhered on the surface of SLN will disperse from the nanoparticle and will show an immediate release effect, thereafter the matrix can erode or degrade depending upon the lipid composition, and release the drug in a controlled manner. Temperature or surface-active agents can control drug solubility in water. Temperature based drug release or high amount of surfactant can cause burst release of drug from SLN [40].

Thus, the production of the SLN is usually takes place at\nroom temperature to avoid burst release and partition of drug in aqueous phase. This can lead into partitioning of majority of drug in lipid phase and, therefore, a sustained or controlled release without any immediate release of drug can be observed from SLN. The common ideology of drug release from SLNs depicts that the release is affected by particle size. Smaller particles with large surface area provide rapid drug release as compared to larger particles. Further, drug release also depends on the type of drug entrapment model of SLN, for example, faster drug release can be observed with drug enriched shell model. Venkateswarlu and Manjunath have performed in vitro release studies on SLN containing clozapine. Release of clozapine followed Weibul and Higuchi equations rather than the first order equation. Drug properties can influence the release via parameters governing the release such as drug solubility (water or lipid soluble), and its interaction with the lipid matrix. Influence of temperature at the time of production can cause solublization of drug in water as the high enthalpy will dissolve the drug, which can lead to deposition of drug on the outer surface of the lipid matrix [41]. SLNs have also been tuned to provide drug release in response to external or internal stimuli. Using the concept of solid-liquid transition upon heating, thermoresponsive SLNs have been recently reported. A mixture of lipids (lauric acid and oleic acid, lauric acid, and linoleic acid) was used in this study to fabricate SLNs. Drug release study demonstrated rapid release of loaded 5-fluorouracil (>90%) at 39 ◦C attributed to the melting of lipid core, whereas 22–34% of drug release was observed at 37 ◦C due to the solid core [42]. In another study, cholesterol-PEG coated SLNs have been investigated for its pH sensitive drug release pattern. These particles show faster drug release of loaded doxorubicin at pH 4.7 compared to pH 7.4. Depletion of electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged lipid core lauric acid (due to its protonation) and the positively charged doxorubicin was suggested to be responsible for accelerated release at low pH [43]."

Recently, Baek et al. modified the SLN surface by coating N-carboxymethyl chitosan (NCC) for enhancing the oral bioavailability of curcumin. The purpose of coating was to reduce the burst release of curcumin from SLN in gastric acidic environment in order to avoid curcumin degradation. In vitro release experiment suggested a negligible amount of drug release in gastric fluid from NCC coated SLN, whereas unmodified SLN exhibit burst release. In contrast, sustained release was observed in simulated intestinal fluid suggesting an advantage of coating to deliver most of the drug to the intestine. Further, higher AUC and Cmax of curcumin were observed in vivo from NCC modified SLN. These results suggested NCC modified SLN facilitate intestinal absorption by increasing lymphatic\nuptake (which allows formulations to avoid CYP3A-mediated hepatic first pass metabolism), and by decreasing drug degradation in acidic environment [65].

In vitro cytotoxicity assay suggested superior activity of CChSLN towards killing of cancer cells compared to uncoated particles.

Oral lipid based systems vary from simple lipid solutions to self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) [98]."

      "text" : "SLNs are an amalgamation of the properties of liposomes and polymer based carriers, where encapsulation of both lipid soluble and water soluble drugs could be possible. Production of SLN is inexpensive, and scale up is feasible. They pose high stability during their shelf life, and a wide range of lipids are available for tuning the release kinetics. SLNs have emerged as efficient drug delivery systems and the future of lipid based drug delivery is largely dependent on SLNs due to their various significant properties. Scientists have already filed many patents related to SLNs and we can anticipate more patented SLN-based delivery systems in the near future.\nFunding: This study was funded by Academy of Finland grant numbers 309374 and 309794.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest."
