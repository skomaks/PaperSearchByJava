      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The industrial wastewater generally including organic and inorganic contaminants can be the important threat to the environment [1]. Heavy metal ions and dyes are emitted from the various industrial plants including textile, petrochemical industry [2]. In addition, lead and dye cations are of the particular concerns because of their toxic effects on the human health and the water environment [3,4]. Therefore, Pb (II) ion and methylene blue cation emissions must be regulated due to the release of these environmental contaminants. Consequently, many methods, such as adsorption [5], photocatalytic separation [6] and membrane process [7], have been offered for the removal of Pb (II) ions and methylene blue from polluted wastewater. Recently, adsorption has received significant interest, but the separation of powder adsorbent such as activated carbon and alumina from aqueous solutions at the end of the process is the main problem in this technique. However the adsorption is one of the most promising environmental technologies for the removal of Pb (II) and dyes simultaneously, due to its high removal efficiency and low operating temperature by using the low cost adsorbents. Over recent years, the adsorption of heavy metal ions has been widely investigated over non-magnetic adsorbents such as the activated carbon and alumina [8–14].\nIn general, an activated carbon has higher activity than other porous adsorbents, although its synthesis is more difficult and expensive. Therefore, exploiting low cost raw materials for preparation of the activated carbon would be more desirable [15]. It is also hard for the separation of the activated carbon from the wastewater after the maximum adsorption capacity is achieved. Many extensive studies concerning the adsorption of heavy metal cations and dyes over magnetic adsorbents were reported [16–19] but few of these studies involve the competitive adsorption of metal and dye ion.\nMagnetic metal organic framework composite was prepared by using an efficient strategy for removal of Pb (II) ions and dyes from aqueous solution [16]. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of Pb (II) and methylene blue ions were calculated to be 102 and 128 mg/g, respectively. Huang et al. [17] found that the magnetic graphene oxide derived by solvothermal method was an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions from the aqueous solutions including Pb (II), Cu (II) and Cd(II). Supermagnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-SH) were also synthesized for adsorption of heavy metal ions (Pb (II), Cu (II), Zn (II) and Ni (II)) in the industrial wastewater [18]. In continued, the novel magnetic nanocomposite was prepared by using coffee wastes for the adsorption of Pb (II) ions from wastewater [20]. The magnetite nanoparticles were also dispersed on the surface by applying the single precipitation method. The experimental data illustrated that the maximum adsorption capacity of Pb (II) for prepared sample was measured to be 41.15 mg/g. Jin et al. [21] studied the adsorption of Pb (II) ions and methylene blue in the wastewater by employing the modified lignin. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacities were achieved to be 83.20 and 39.30 mg/g for Pb (II) and methylene blue cations, respectively. Oxidized mesoporous carbon was evaluated for removal of malachite green and Pb (II) ions from water [22]. The adsorption capacity was determined to be 963.10 and 198.60 mg/g for malachite green and Pb (II) ions respectively, while the experimental data was in the good agreement with Freundlich equation. The magnetic copperferrite/drumstick pod composite was synthesized by co-precipitation method for the removal of malachite green and Pb (II) ions in the unary and binary aqueous solutions [23]. The evaluation of the prepared adsorbent illustrated that the adsorption capacity of Pb (II) ions was increased in the presence of malachite green ions.\nIn many investigations, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has been used for the modification of adsorbent surface for adsorption of cations from the aqueous solutions [24]. EDTA as a surface modifier can increase the removal efficiency of the contaminant and also as a protective in the magnetic adsorbents to prevent the oxidation of iron oxide nanoparticles [24]. The functionalized magnetic graphene oxide by\nusing EDTA and chitosan was fabricated for the removal of cationic dye [25]. The maximum adsorption capacity was obtained to be about 1085.3 mg/g by using Langmuir model. Functionalization by using EDTA had two important benefits for the adsorbent including the increasing the adsorption capacity and enhancement of reusability and stability of magnetic adsorbent. EDTA-functionalized magnetic graphene oxide was also synthesized for the adsorption of heavy metal ions [26]. The results showed that EDTA with six ligands (four carboxylic and two amino groups) could form coordination complexes with most cations in the aqueous solutions. Amino and carboxylic groups are considered the efficient chelating functional groups for the adsorption of contaminant ions in the aquatic solutions [27].\nTherefore, in light of mentioned researches, the core-shell functionalized modified magnetic activated carbon and alumina were synthesized to investigate the adsorption characteristics of methylene blue in the single solution and in the presence of Pb (II) ions. The physical characteristics and the effect of operating conditions including pH, adsorption temperature and initial concentration of contaminant were analyzed in this work. In addition, the isotherm and kinetic models were studied on the experimental data to find the maximum competitive adsorption capacity of the samples."

      "text" : "The activated carbon was derived from the peach stone and wood by physical method using water vapor as a chemical agent at 800 �C. In the present work, the used gamma-alumina was also purchased from Merck Company. The activated carbons and alumina were grinded and sorted by using mesh no. 100. The prepared initial adsorbents were treated by phosphoric acid for the surface modification and the removal of undesirable materials from activated carbons and gamma-alumina. After that, the modified adsorbents were washed for several times and dried in the oven at 100 �C. The nano-magnetic adsorbents were synthesized by a facile method as described in this section. Initially, 5 mL of hydrazine and 136 mL of deionized water were mixed over the stirrer for 30 min at the ambient temperature for the reduction of dissolved oxygen from reaction solution.\nAfterwards, 2 g of modified adsorbents (activated carbons or alumina), 4.32 g of FeCl3⋅6H2O, 1.59 g of FeCl2⋅4 H2O and 2.56 g NaOH were added to the prepared solution from the previous step and stirred at 70 �C for 7 min. Finally, the black nano-magnetic sample was separated from the aqueous solution by using an external magnetic field, then; the produced adsorbent was washed several times by the mixture of deionized water and ethanol and dried at 100 �C in the oven for overnight. The functionalized magnetic adsorbent was prepared by applying ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as followed.40 mL of acetic acid (10% v/v) and 2 g of nano-modified magnetic adsorbent were mixed at the room temperature for 30 min (solution 1). 8 g of EDTA were also added to 130 mL of deionized water and mixed at the 60 �C for 30 min, separately (solution 2). After that, solution 1 and solution 2 were mixed at 25 �C for 8 h. Finally, the functionalized adsorbent was filtrated, washed and dried at 90 �C for 12 h. The graphical scheme for the preparation method was shown for the better understanding of readers in Fig. 1. The synthesized samples were named according to the preparation method and raw materials as summarized in Table 1. It must be pointed that the chemical materials were purchased from Merck Company."

A given amount (0.01–0.2 g) of the magnetic adsorbents was utilized in the batch system that was controlled by using shaker\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M. Zabihi\nMaterials Chemistry and Physics 248 (2020) 122893\nincubator (DUOMAX 1030 INKUBATOR 1000, Heidolph Instruments GmbH, Schwabach, Germany). The initial concentration of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions was set in the 10–100 mg/l range. The volume of contaminated water was also considered about 50 mL, the temperature of adsorption ranged from 25 to 55 �C. The experimental runs for investigation of the adsorption study were carried out several times in range of 3–180 min. Mettler Toledo 320-S pH meter (Mettler Toledo Instruments Co.

The concentration of methylene blue and Pb (II) cations were measured by applying UV–Vis spectrophotometry (agilent) and Varian atomic adsorption, respectively.\nCalibration curve was depicted to calculate the final concentration of methylene blue in the aqueous solution according to its absorbance. The absorbance of methylene blue was evaluated at a wavelength of 665 nm as seen in Fig. 2. The calibration was conducted at the various concentrations of methylene blue.

      "text" : "Fig. 3 shows the XRD results for three prepared functionalized magnetic adsorbents with wide and weak peaks at 2θ ¼ 15-80�. As seen in Fig. 3, the XRD graphs for two carbonaceous adsorbents including MFMPAC and MFMWAC were included two phases consisting of amorphous and wide and weak peaks. The discovered amorphous phase\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M. Zabihi\nMaterials Chemistry and Physics 248 (2020) 122893\non the XRD patterns of the magnetic activated carbons was related to the presence of carbon which is referenced by many researches [30,31]. On the other hand, the stronger and sharper peaks were appeared over the XRD pattern of the functionalized magnetic gamma-alumina named MFMA in comparison with the magnetic activated carbons (MFMPAC and MFMWAC). The peaks of XRD curves were attributed to the iron oxides, alpha and gamma alumina according to the preparation method. The detected peaks on the results of MFMPAC indicated three phases of iron oxides encompassing goethite (α-FeOOH), hematite (α-Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) at 2θ ¼ 26.75� (ICDD ¼ 00-001-0662), 33.28� (ICDD ¼ 00-001-1053) and 35.45� (ICDD ¼ 00-001-1111), respectively. In continued, the XRD analysis illustrated that only the magnetite crystallites were identified over MFMWAC at 2θ ¼ 35.45� and 62.97�. Therefore, it can be predicted that the magnetic strength of wood based activated carbon (MFMWAC) will be stronger than MFMPAC due to the higher intensity of magnetite crystallites. The magnetite and alumina crystallites were distinguished on the XRD results of MFMA by using X’PertHighScore Software version 3.0d. The size of formed crystallites was calculated using applying Scherrer equation [31] by assuming the spherical shape as summarized in Table 2. It can be found from the reported results that the size of crystallites was smaller than 60 nm for all of the prepared samples.\nThe obtained sizes also indicated that the smallest crystallites were generated over the wood based activated carbon. Therefore, the performance of MFMWAC can be better than the other adsorbents.\nThe FTIR analysis was carried out to specify the added functional groups on the prepared magnetic adsorbents as indicated in Fig. 4. The FTIR curves were presented for the all synthesized samples in the various steps of the preparation method (as described in Table 1). According to the displayed FTIR results in Fig. 4a, all the peaks can be visible at the wavelength of 568–668 cm 1 are related to the Fe–O vibrations due to the formation of Fe3O4 [32]. The strong peaks at around 720-931 cm 1 were corresponded to Al–O due to the main substrate which is gamma-alumina [33]. The presented peak at the wavelength of 1633 cm 1 is related to the bond of carbon-oxygen which is assigned to the stretching vibration of C–O in asymmetrical COO due to the presence of functional groups placed by applying EDTA as a chemical agent [34]. The weak peak at the wavelength of 1400 cm 1 related to the C–N bond is appeared poorly only over the alumina adsorbent due to the impregnation by EDTA. The absorption peaks at around 3300-3400 cm 1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of N–H and –OH groups respectively, that overlap each other [35]. FTIR spectra were analyzed for the magnetic activated carbons in each step of the preparation method as reported in Fig. 4b and c. As already mentioned, the vibration in the range of 580–690 cm 1 is related to the presence of\nFe–O bond to the dispersion of magnetite nanoparticles [36, 37]. The plotted curves in Fig. 4b and c state that there are very weak peaks in the range of 1100–1150 cm 1 attributed to the C–NH2 bond due to the surface functionalization of the activated carbons by employing EDTA. However, the C–NH2 stretch (str.) is observed for MFMWAC, MFWAC, MFMPAC, and MFPAC samples. The created vibrations at the wave number of 1633 cm 1 are related to the adsorbed water molecules for all of the samples. It should be noted that the overlapping of C–O, C–C and water molecules vibrations at wave number of 1633 cm 1 was occurred for the functionalized adsorbents by EDTA [34and38]. The fairly weak peaks also appear at about 2916 cm 1 which are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of C–H due to the presence of propyl groups [29] while they are poor for the carbonaceous samples. It is noteworthy that the carboxylic groups are essential for grafting the Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the substrate. So that the hydrolysis and dehydrolysis of Fe (III) ions can be performed over the surface of activated carbons for dispersing of the magnetite nanoparticles.\nThere is a negligible difference between the intensity peaks of the fresh and used adsorbents after the adsorption of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions named MFMWAC, as seen in Fig. 4b. The FTIR results before and after the adsorption of cations illustrated that functional groups of –OH, C–O stretching, and amine groups may participate interactions with mentioned ions. In the other word, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can form a negative charge on the surface of the adsorbent which is to be an appropriate for the adsorption of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions. The appeared peak at 450/460 cm 1 is ascribed to Pb–O on the FTIR graph of the used MFMWAC sample [39,40]. The –OH str. and C–O str. vibrations of MFWAC at 3400 and 1633 cm 1 were shifted to 3390 and 1623 cm 1 for the used sample, respectively, due to the ionic and the various coordinate interactions including (bidentate bridging/bidentate chelation/monodentate, as explained in the published works [38and41]) between –COO- and cations. In addition, the formed peaks at the range of 1340–1360 cm 1 [38] over the FTIR graph of the used MFMWAC revealed the presence of methylene blue dimers and H-aggregates. The FTIR peaks and wavenumbers were summarized in Table 3. Therefore, the FTIR test can confirm the iron oxide peaks at the XRD results.\nTo contemplate the mechanism in the simultaneous adsorption of methylene blue and Pb (II), XPS analysis of the fresh and used MFMWAC were conducted. The XPS full scan spectrum of MFMWAC before and after of the competitive adsorption of Pb (II) and methylene blue ions were plotted in Fig. 5a and b. The detected characteristic peaks indicate the presence of O1s (532.77 eV), Fe2p (710.87 eV), C1s (284.8 eV), Pb4f (138.9 eV) and N1s (400.1 eV) in the structure of the fresh and used MFMWAC which were evaluated by the previous works [42]. The intensity variations and the presence of shifted peaks including C1s, O1s,\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M. Zabihi\nMaterials Chemistry and Physics 248 (2020) 122893\nFe2p, Pb4f and N 1s for the used sample illustrated the attachment of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions after the adsorption [41].\nFig. 5c and d indicated the spectrum of O 1s for the fresh and used MFMWAC sample with two deconvoluted peaks at 531.64 (C–O) and 533.49 eV (C–OH) (fresh sample) which were shifted to the binding energy of 533.40 (C–O) and 535.51 eV (C–OH) over the used sample, respectively.\nThe formation coordinate bonds or stronger interactions as pointed in FTIR results between the cations (adsorbate) and MFMWAC (adsorbent) can be the main reason for the remarkable change in the binding energy of the deconvoluted peaks as summarized in Table 4.\nFig. 5e and f showed spectrum of C1s for the prepared sample before and after the adsorption. The peak of C1s on the XPS pattern of the used and fresh MFMWAC showed three deconvoluted peaks with the various binding energies encompassing 284.80, 286.47 and 288.65 eV, which could be related to the different forms of C–C, C–N, and O–C–O (carboxyl groups), respectively. The tracing of C–N group was related to the existence of EDTA on the both used and fresh samples which confirmed the preparation method. It is obvious that the intensity and\nthe position of the various C1s component peaks were changed after the adsorption of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions as offered in Table 4. Therefore, the mentioned results indicated the remarkable role of EDTA in the adsorption of Pb(II) and methylene blue, simultaneously [43]. It must be noted that shifted bonding energy can be ignored after the adsorption process. The binding energies at 710.87 eV and 723.57 eV are ascribed to Fe2p3/2, and Fe2p1/2 for fresh MFMWAC, respectively, which corroborate the formation of Fe3O4 in the structure of samples (Fig. 5g). The achievements showed that in comparison with C1s peak, the intensity of Fe2p boosted by adsorption of Pb (II) and methylene blue ions. It must be pointed that the intensity of Fe2p peaks is negligible compared with C1s peaks for both samples. The results also revealed that the deconvoluted peaks of Fe 2p were shifted to 711.40 and 724.90 eV for Fe2p3/2, and Fe2p1/2 respectively.\nIn continued, The Pb4f peak was distinguished only after the adsorption process at 138.9 eV in Fig. 5b. As shown in Fig. 5h, the two Pb4f peaks including Pb4f5/2 and Pb4f7/2 were detected in binding energies of 143.8 and 138.9 eV, respectively. So, the complex of Pb (II) with functional groups was led to form PbO on the surface of adsorbent [44]. The significant change was also determined in the binding energy of Pb4f7/2, from 139.30 eV [41] for un-adsorbed Pb(II) to 143.80/138.9 eV in Pb(II) on the used MFMWAC as reported in Table 4. Besides, the intensity of N1s (with a negligible shifting in binding energy) and O1s peaks increased on the XPS pattern of the used adsorbent\nFig. 2. Calibration curve of methylene blue.\nFig. 3. XRD patterns for MFMPC, MFMWAC and MFMA nano-adsorbents.\nFig. 4a. FTIR graphs for the magnetic samples prepared by using gamma-alumina.\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M. Zabihi\nMaterials Chemistry and Physics 248 (2020) 122893\nwhich also demonstrated the adsorption of methylene blue. The micro-images of FESEM were evaluated for three functionalized magnetic samples modified by acid treatment in Fig. 6. As can be deduced from FESEM results, the size of adsorbent particles and formed crystallites of iron oxides was measured smaller than 50 nm which is confirmed by Scherrer equation and XRD results. The appropriate dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles was indicated by using FESEM images for three prepared samples named MFMA, MFMPAC and MFMWAC. It is clear that the nanoparticles of MFMA and the functionalized magnetic activated carbons (MFMPAC and MFMWAC) were dispersed in shape of rod and sphere, respectively. The mesoporous structure of activated carbons was also observed in the FESEM images.\nTEM images of the synthesized samples indicated the well dispersed magnetic nanoparticles as seen in Fig. 7. The results showed that the\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M. Zabihi\nMaterials Chemistry and Physics 248 (2020) 122893\nmagnetic nanoparticles as a core (black points) were coated by the prepared activated carbons and gamma-alumina as a shell (grey points). The images also illustrated the nanoparticles with size of less than 50 nm\nwhich is in the good agreement with the XRD and FESEM tests. The various characterizations based on scattering, diffraction and transmission for investigating the structure of adsorbents are discussed. In the present work, the functionalized magnetic adsorbents were synthesized with core-shell structure. In the other words, The Fe3O4 in core and the substrates including the prepared activated carbons and gammaalumina with EDTA as the functional groups in shell were formed. Therefore, TEM and XPS tests were also applied to show the core-shell structure of magnetic adsorbents. TEM images (Fig. 7) showed the encapsulated magnetite by substrates clearly. Similar results were reported for the core-shell magnetic nanocomposites in the previous works [45,46]. Zanato et al. [45] also prepared bimetallic Pt–Pd nanocatalyst on the encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles as a core-shell sample. XPS is also used for the surface characterization and structure of various samples. As seen in Fig. 5 XPS results show that the peak with the highest intensity is related to the C1s located in 284.8 eV (binding energy). In addition, the intensity of the peak correspond to the Fe3O4 at 711.4 eV is negligible in comparison with carbon peak. Therefore, XPS achievements confirm the core-shell structure of adsorbents and the Fe3O4 was\nCenter Peaks (binding energy (eV))\nFresh sample (MFMWAC)\nUsed sample; MFMWAC (after the adsorption)\nC 1s (C–C) 284.80 285.00 C 1s (C–N) 286.47 286.66 C 1s\n(O–C––O) 288.65 288.85 O 1s (C– –O) 531.64 533.40 O 1s (C–OH) 533.49 535.51 Pb 4f 5/2 – 143.80 Pb 4f 7/2 – 138.90 Fe 2p 1/2 723.57 724.90 Fe 2p 3/2 710.87 711.40 N 1s 400.10 399.70\nFig. 5e.

BET analysis was accomplished by using the adsorption-desorption of nitrogen over the functionalized magnetic samples and the raw adsorbents (before magnetization and functionalization) as shown in Fig. 8. The volume of pores, surface area of each sample and the average diameter of pores are also summarized in Table 5. As can be seen from the hysteresis plots in Fig. 8a–c, the graphs indicate that the hysteresis curves are in consistent with type of IV which is classified according to the IUPAC classification, showing the mesoporous structure of the prepared adsorbents. Two important points can be deduced from the obtained results. First, the mesoporous structure of the activated carbons and gamma-alumina as the substrate can provide the appropriate conditions for the dispersion of the magnetite nanoparticles over the porous samples. Based on the previous studies the use of mesoporous adsorbents would be also the great assistance for the removal of methylene blue and Pb (II) cations form aqueous solutions [48–51]. The second point is that there is no different between the structure of the substrates and the synthesized functionalized magnetic samples by forming the nanoparticles of Fe3O4 that indicating the high stability of the activated carbons and alumina. Table 5 also shows the sharp decrease of the surface area of the substrates due to the dispersion of the iron oxide\nnanoparticles, which demonstrates the well distribution of the magnetic crystallites on the activated carbons and alumina. BET analysis and the calculated data offered in Table 5 confirm the XRD, FESEM tests and the estimated size of crystallites by using Scherrer equation.\nTo investigate the magnetic properties of the synthesized adsorbents including MFMA, MFMPAC and MFMWAC, a vibrating magnetic device was employed, and the results were presented in Fig. 9. As shown from the hysteresis of each sample in Fig. 9, the magnetic saturation values of the adsorbents were measured to be 20.49, 14.13 and 0.12 emu/g for MFMA, MFMWAC and MFMPAC, respectively. The results show well that two prepared samples consisting of MFMA and MFMWAC have the appropriate magnetic strength, which is in good agreement with the XRD results that show the presence of magnetite nanoparticles with the stronger peaks. However, MFMPAC adsorbent was prepared with no significant magnetic strength as expected from its XRD graph with the very weak Fe3O4 magnetic crystallites.\nTherefore, according to the structural results of MFMWAC as the magnetic activated carbon, it can be considered as a suitable choice among the other adsorbents for simultaneous removal of dyes and Pb (II) ions."

The adsorption was carried out under the specification operating conditions while the adsorption temperature, pH of solution and the initial concentration were kept constant at 25 �C, 7 and 50 mg/l in 50 mL of the solution. It is obvious from the depicted results in Fig. 10, the raw adsorbents including the wood based activated carbon, peach stone based activated carbon and the gamma alumina have the better performances in comparison with the magnetic samples. On the other hand, the magnetic adsorbent with the lower adsorption capacity compared with the raw substrates can be separated from aqueous solutions easily by applying the external magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetization, surface functionalization and modification of the magnetic samples were conducted to enhance the adsorption capacities. The maximum removal efficiency was achieved to be 99.37, 99.56 and 67.85% by using MFMWAC, MFMPAC and MFMA, respectively. It is clear that the better performances have been obtained by applying the carbonaceous adsorbents in comparison with alumina."

      "text" : "The alkalinity effect of the adsorption media can play an important role in the adsorption efficiency due to the presence of functional groups on the surface of the adsorbents and the existence of the cationic ions such as methylene blue and lead in the aqueous solutions. The adsorption mechanism can be explained by two different ways including diffusion and electrostatic adsorption due to the porosity and the presence of negatively charged functional groups on the surface of the magnetic nano-sorbents. The pollutant cations can precipitate on the surface of the adsorbents in the alkaline solutions due to the presence of OH ions. As illustrated in Fig. 11a, the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents including MFMWAC and MFMPAC increased by increasing the ambient pH from 2 to 11 but these changes were negligible. However, the significant effect of pH was occurred on the removal of methylene blue by employing MFMA sample. The main reason for the obtained results can be described by the higher porosity of the carbonaceous samples compared with MFMA and the diffusion is the main determinant of the adsorption process. The adsorption was practically controlled by the molecular diffusion and the strong interaction between OH and the detected functional groups with the negative charge from FTIR spectra inhibited the increasing of the removal efficiency. The similar results were reported in the previous works [28and52] that indicate the molecular diffusion is main cause of the adsorption.\nFig. 5g. XPS patterns of the Fe2p.\nFig. 5h. XPS patterns of the Pb4f.\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M. Zabihi\nMaterials Chemistry and Physics 248 (2020) 122893\nThe results of zeta potential analysis were also indicated in Fig. 11b for three magnetic adsorbents including MFMPAC, MFMWAC and MFMA to measure the pH value at which the zeta potential is zero. The zeta potential of the prepared samples in the tested pH range (2–12) was between þ40 and 40 mV. Based on the obtained results, the isoelectric points for MFMWAC, MFMPAC and MFMA can be calculated to be about 4.5, 5.3 and 7 pH, respectively. The obtained values of pH when the zeta potential is zero indicate that in the acidic and alkaline environments the magnetic adsorbent has positive and negative charge, respectively. At pH upper than the measured isoelectric point, the surface charge of the synthesized samples is negative which is proper for removal of methylene blue cations due to the electrostatic attraction. Therefore, there is a good agreement between the achievements of zeta potential test and the results of investigating the effect of initial pH of solution on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents."

The demonstrated results in Fig. 12 showed that the adsorption capacity of the prepared adsorbents increased with increasing the temperature. The rate of the diffusion will increase with increasing the temperature in the studied range [9]. As shown in Fig. 12, the adsorption capacities increased from 204.90 to 288.50 mg/g for MFMWAC, from 231.40 to 235.90 mg/g for MFMPAC\nand from 95.20 to 97.90 mg/g for MFMA. It is obvious that the effect of temperature was negligible for the sample with alumina substrate due to its lower surface area and porosity in comparison with the carbonaceous samples. Therefore, the presence of the functional groups on the surface of MFMA sample is to be determinative for the rate of adsorption."

The results illustrated that the removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity decreased and increased with increasing the initial concentration, respectively. In fact, due to the decrease in the active sites required for high concentrations of dye, the removal efficiency of the soluble contaminant decreases. The adsorption capacity increases due to the increase of the initial concentration of dye as the driving force then, the adsorption capacity increases as more molecules sit on the surface [10]."

Initially, the equilibrium adsorption of methylene blue was evaluated between three magnetic adsorbents by employing Langmuir and Freundlich equations [55] (eqs. (6) and (7)). The equilibrium adsorption capacity versus the equilibrium concentration of methylene blue was depicted in Fig. 15a.\nH. Ebadollahzadeh and M.

The maximum adsorption capacities of MFMWAC, MFMPAC and MFMA were calculated to be 437.78, 434.13 and 196.08 mg/g, respectively. Based on the reported results in Table 7, the correlation coefficient derived from Freundlich model is closer to one in comparison with Langmuir equation in the single solution.\nFinally, the carbonaceous adsorbents (MFMPAC and MFMWAC) were selected to continue the investigation of the competitive\nadsorption of methylene blue in the presence of Pb (II) ions in the binary solutions, due to their better performance than MFMA sample.\nIsotherm adsorption was also studied to evaluate the effect of interaction between different ions at the various initial concentrations in the binary solutions. The competitive adsorption of methylene blue was performed in the presence of Pb (II) ions in the binary solutions with the equal initial concentration of contaminant ions while the other operating conditions were kept constant (pH ¼ 7, Dosage of adsorbents ¼ 10 mg and the contact time ¼ 3 h).

Fig. 15b shows that the adsorption capacity of the prepared magnetic activated carbons was obtained higher for methylene blue than Pb (II) ions in the same operating conditions.\nHowever, the significant adsorption capacity of the synthesized adsorbents was observed despite the Pb (II) disturbance ions on the methylene blue adsorption. The adsorption capacities of MFMWAC and MFMPAC samples were also measured to be 175.39 and 182.45 mg/g for methylene blue and 52.11 and 61.82 mg/g for Pb (II) ions, respectively.\nA comparison was carried out between the capacity of the presented samples in this work and the other adsorbents reported in open literature with the same application in Table 9.\nThe listed works in Table 9 was led to evaluate the competitive adsorption of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions in the aqueous solutions. However, there is no offered calculation the co-adsorption capacity for the adsorbents in the binary solutions which was carried out in this study. Gong et al. [60] reported the modified graphite oxide coated sand for the simultaneous adsorption of Pb (II) and methylene blue ions in the multi-component solutions. It was found that the presence of Pb (II) ions in the wastewater had a synergic effect on the adsorption of methylene blue. The adsorption capacity of methylene blue increased from 55.33 to 71.50 mg/g. Shi et al. [63] found that an aerobic granular sludge can be a proper adsorbent for removal of dye and heavy metal ions in the binary solutions. The results indicated that the existence of Pb (II) ions had a negative influence on the adsorption of methylene blue. The maximum adsorption capacity was measured to be 68.88 mg/g by using the extended Langmuir for methylene blue in the aquatic solution. Thus, it can be concluded that a promising magnetic adsorbents were synthesized with remarkable adsorption capacity in the single and binary solutions, in this work."

It should be noted, however, that the sample named MFMPAC was separated by using filtration method from the solution after each cycle due to its very low magnetic strength. Then the adsorbent was regenerated by using HNO3 solution (1 M) when the sample was mixed in the solution for 2 h at 25 �C. After that, the used adsorbent was washed for several times by using the solution containing deionized water and ethanol. The washed adsorbent was dried at 90 �C for overnight in the oven. The negligible reduction was detected in the adsorption capacity of MFMWAC with increasing in the number of cycles as shown in Fig. 16a. However, after the sixth cycle, a significant drop in the adsorption capacity of MFMPAC was observed (Fig. 16b), with the adsorption capacity decreasing by about 30% (99.29–69.50 mg/g for methylene blue and 53.30 to 38.89 mg/g for Pb (II)). The main reason in this regard may be due to the difficult separation of MFMPAC compared to MFMWAC. Finally, MFMWAC can be a beneficial magnetic adsorbent for using in the practical applications with the real scale."

      "text" : "The adsorption of methylene blue and Pb (II) ions as the representative organic and inorganic contaminants of wastewater by the functionalized magnetic adsorbents was evaluated in the single and binary aqueous solutions. Three core-shell nano magnetic adsorbents named MFMWAC, MFMPAC and MFMA were prepared and functionalized by\nEDTA with size less than 50 nm. Maximum adsorption capacities of MFMWAC and MFMPAC were achieved to be 175.39 and 182.45 and 61.82 mg/g for methylene blue in the presence of Pb (II) in the binary solution by using the extended Langmuir. The experimental results revealed that the removal efficiency of samples was in the order: MFMPAC > MFMWAC > MFMA. The experimental findings on the effective operating conditions disclosed that adsorption capacity of three prepared samples increased with increasing adsorption temperature, pH and initial concentration in the single solutions similar to the reported results of literature. In addition, the kinetic behavior of the prepared adsorbents illustrated that the pseudo second order kinetic was in the good agreement with experimental data. Freundlich isotherm model was also in the good consistent with the equilibrium adsorption of methylene blue in the single solution. The achievements showed that the difference of adsorption capacity between MFMPAC and MFMWAC was negligible while the magnetic strength of MFMWAC was to be stronger in comparison with MFMPAC sample. Therefore, MFMWAC sample can be a proper choice as the strong magnetic adsorbent for removal of dyes and heavy metal ions simultaneously. Reusability and stability of the carbonaceous magnetic nanocomposites were also studied which showed that the negligible reduction was occurred in the adsorption capacity of MFMWAC after six cycles.\nH.
