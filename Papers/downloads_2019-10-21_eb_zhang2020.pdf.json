The coupling of MCE with mass spectrometry (MS) would greatly improve complex sample identification capability as well as system detection sensitivity. In the present study, a simple and robust ionization source, named as straight nano-electrospray ionization (nanoESI) source was developed, which was applied to couple MCE with MS. A stainless-steel needle attached directly at the end of an MCE capillary was used as the nanoESI emitter, and the connection between this emitter to the liquid flow in the MCE separation channel was established through a liquid bridge. After optimization, this straight nanoESI source enhanced the ion signal intensity by ~10 times when compared with a commercial nanoESI source. The MCE-straight nanoESI-MS system was also characterized in terms of mixture separation and peptide hydrodynamic radius measurements. Compared to our previous work when a UV detector was used in a commercial Lumex CE system (model Capel 105M, St. Petersburg, Russia), peptides with much lower concentrations could be analyzed (from ~1mg/mL to ~20 μg/mL) in terms of radius measurement."

      "text" : "There are growing needs for sensitive and selective analytical tools in the fields of biopharmaceutics, protein chemistry and biotechnology [1]. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) shows attractive features of highly efficient separations of ionized polar and charged substances [2,3], and its combination with mass spectrometry (MS) would provide a very selective and sensitive tool for compounds identification and structure characterization [4–7]. However, an appropriate ion source plays a key role in CE-MS systems. Since its introduction in 1987 by Smith et al. [8], CE-ESI-MS has proven to be a powerful analytical tool with a wide applicability, including drug analysis [9], forensic toxicology [10], metabolomics [11]and proteomic profiling [12]. Coupling of CE with ESI-MS is not straightforward as both the CE and ESI processes require closed electrical circuits and flow compensation in the interface [13]. Generally, CE–MS interfacing via an ESI source can be performed in two different ways [14]. In the most frequently applied approach, the interface uses a sheath liquid that mixes with the CE effluent as it exits the separation capillary. The sheath flow serves to establish the electrical contact with the CE background electrolyte (BGE) and facilitates ESI using a borosilicate glass ion source or\nstainless electrospray emitter. The sheath-liquid interface could ensure electrospray stability and robustness [15]. An electro kinetically pumped sheath-flow interface and a flow-through micro vial interface were successfully developed by Dovichi's group [16] and Chen's group [17], respectively. Since ionization efficiency of ESI is sensitive to analyte concentration and non-volatile salt concentration, dilution effect of the sheath liquid needs to be carefully controlled [18]. In the second CE–ESI-MS design, the terminating electrical contact for the CE process is made directly to the BGE just before or after it leaves the capillary. Such a so-called sheathless ion source is usually realized by tapering the capillary inner diameter. Besides eliminating the dilution effect, the sheathless approach also allows the spray tip to be positioned closer to the MS inlet. As a result, enhanced sensitivity and lower limits of detection (LODs) can be obtained [19]. Over time, various sheathless CE–ESI-MS interface designs have been developed. The most widely used method for establishing the terminating electrical contact is coating the outer surface of the CE capillary tip with a conductive material such as gold [20], graphite [21] or copper [22]. Lifetimes of such coatings are generally limited as they suffer from deterioration under influence of the high voltages applied [23]. Alternatively, a wire microelectrode can be inserted into the capillary\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.120183 Received 21 May 2019; Received in revised form 24 July 2019; Accepted 26 July 2019\n* Corresponding author.

In order to circumvent the problem of closing the electrical circuit in sheathless CE–MS interfacing, Moini [27] has introduced a porous sheathless CE–MS interface which was called the high-sensitivity porous sprayer (HSPS) in SCIEX and Beckman Coulter. This integrated method provides electrical contact by etching the bare fused-silica capillary with hydrofluoric acid until the section becomes conductive when in contact with an electrolyte. This interface operates best when the currents under 10 μA are used and care must be taken for its thin fragile wall during assembly of interface to separation capillary [28]. It is also necessary to replace the conductive liquid inside the needle every 3 h, as it may dry out or cause oxidation in the needle. Due to the complexity of biosystems, there are also demanding needs to not only measure the molecular weight and/or sequence of biomolecules, but also the structure of biomolecules. For example, ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS) [29]is increasingly applied in lipidomics [30], metabolomics [31] and top-down proteomics [32]. As a type of CE, mobility capillary electrophoresis was introduced, in which electroosmotic flow (EOF) was minimized and replaced by a laminar flow, so that ion hydrodynamic radius could be determined [33,34]. More recently, it has been shown that Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) could also be performed on MCE peaks, and both the effective charge and hydrodynamic radius of proteins could be acquired in a single experiment [35]. In this study, a sheathless interface named straight nanoESI source was proposed and applied to couple MCE with a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. The straight nanoESI source was constructed with the assistance of a liquid junction technology. In this approach a stainlesssteel needle was placed at the outlet of the MCE capillary, and a liquid bridge was formed between the liquid flow in the capillary and the tip of the needle. This needle serves two purposes: the nanoESI emitter and a reference electrode for the ESI spray. Straight capillary without tapered tip was used, which could prevent blocking and contamination issues. This sheathless interface was first optimized and tested for sensitivity, which was also compared with a commercial nanoESI emitter. The capability of coupling MCE with MS was also demonstrated for this straight nanoESI source. To measure hydrodynamic radius of ions, it is essential to accurately measure the ion elution time. This un-tapered design with a direct electrical contact maintains a constant flow rate in the CE channel, which in turn helps the accurate measurement of ion migration time and ion radius analysis in MCE."

A 1260 Nanoflow Pump with micro degasser 1260 Infinity and a micro valve (model 1200 Series 2 Position/6 Port, VICI, No. G1162A) were purchased from Agilent technologies (California, American). Disposable stainless-steel acupuncture needles with outside diameter about 120 μm were purchased from Nuking Medical equipment Co., Ltd. (Sichuan, China) and 10 μL-pipette tip (ULR) were purchased from Brand Inc. (Beijing, China). A commercial Nano-electro spray ionization (Nano-ESI) source with a tapered tip diameter of ~19 μm (FS360-5015-D, New Objective, Woburn, MA) and a commercial ESI source (the Agilent Jet Steam source) were used for comparison study. All experiments were carried out using an Agilent G6520B Accurate-\nMass Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, American). The following MS parameters were used in the experiments: the mass spectrometer was scanned (survey scan) over a mass range of 130–2500 (1 micro scan, 50ms maximum ion accumulation time), nitrogen was used as the drying gas (flow rate, 8.0 L/min; temperature, 300 °C). Frag mentor: 200, The Ultra scan mode was applied (full MS parameters: resolution=20000, max ion injection time= 100ms). A negative high voltage from 3300 V to 4000 V (DPS-600, DingTong Co., Ltd, China) was applied to the MS inlet at positive-ion mode, which provides the ionization voltage for the Nano ESI source. Data acquisition, and analysis were performed using Agilent Mass Hunter Workstation software. Bradykinin, phenylalanine (Phe), lysozyme, cytochrome C, Reserpine and Formic acid were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

MS friendly solvent adjusted to a pH of 3.0 with formic acid (0.1%) was used as the solution, otherwise specified. Besides MS friendly, this low pH solution could also minimize EOFs in the capillary."

      "text" : "Since MS friendly solvent was used in MCE experiments, a major consideration in the MCE/MS interface design is an ESI emitter that could match the flow rate of MCE. A tapered emitter tip was used to generate an effective electrospray in conventional ESI especially in nanoESI setups, which was also applied in our previous study [36]. Flow rate of a nanoESI source was typically fixed and optimized within a small range. Broken emitter tips or discontinuous spray would happen if the flow rate is above or below this range. However, flow rate is an important factor affecting the separation capability of MCE, which typically needs to be tuned and optimized during experiments. On the other hand, robustness, repeatability and sensitivity are also important parameters that need to be considered. In this study, constant liquid flow rates were maintained and set by the micro syringe pump. As shown in Fig. 1a, a straight capillary attached with a stainlesssteel needle was designed and used to integrate MCE with MS in this work. A stainless-steel needle was attached to one end of the capillary, and spatially fixed by a pipette tip. As shown in Fig. 1c, both the capillary and the needle were squeezed through a narrow opening of a truncated pipette tip with an opening around 360 μm. Briefly, samples were first introduced by switching the micro valve to the sample syringe in the course of the experiment. In MCE separation mode, this valve was then switched to the nano pump, so that a constant liquid flow (solvent flow) would be provided and set by the nano pump in the separation channel. This constant liquid flow provided a hydrodynamic force to molecules/ions in the separation channel. A high DC voltage (HV1) was also applied across the capillary to provide the electrostatic force, so that ions within the capillary could be separated based on their charge state and hydrodynamic radius. After separation, sample ions would be flushed out of the capillary end, at which a liquid junction (bridge) would be formed between the outlet of the capillary and the stainless-steel needle as shown in Fig. 1a. The stainless-steel needle used in this study has a diameter of 0.12mm, and a sharp tip at the very front (Fig. 1b). Distance between the sharp tip of the stainless-steel needle with the end of the capillary is l, which was optimized in later experiments. With the ionization voltage applied on the MS inlet (HV2), a high electric field would be generated at the tip of the needle. As a result, Taylor cone would form, and analytes in the solution could be MS analyzed. No sheathing gas or nebulizing gas was applied in the\ncurrent setup. A homemade holder was also designed to hold the tee joint (the one close to the emitter), so that the straight nanoESI spray tip could be placed in front of the MS inlet. As shown in Fig. 1c, a 90° angle was kept between the spray tip and the MS inlet, which would help in preventing instrument contamination from large droplets. A fresh silica capillary and the ion source were flushed with buffer solvents (ACN/water 7:3 v/ v) for about 3min to eliminate any chemical residue in the connect kits before use. Since electroosmotic flow (EOF) was not required in MCE, activation of the capillary was not performed before use. The capillary was flushed for ~30min with the running buffer to eliminate cross contaminations between experiments."

      "heading" : "3.1. Electrospray optimization",
      "text" : "First, capillaries with different inner diameters (i.d.) were used to construct straight nanoESI emitters and tested in terms of electrospray stability and efficiency. Fig. 2a plots the normalized total ion current (TIC) of angiotensin II (50 μg/mL) using capillaries with i.d. of 100, 75 and 50 μm, respectively. In experiments, the micro valve was switched to the sample syringe during the whole experiments, speed of the sample syringe was set at 40 μL/h, 3500 V was applied on HV2, l≈200 μm, and no separation voltage was applied (HV1= 0V) in this case. As shown in Fig. 2a, variation coefficients are 8.62%, 11.02% and 11.86% for the straight nanoESI sources with a capillary of 100, 75 and 50 μm i.d., respectively. Results suggest that a relatively stable electrospray could be maintained in all three cases. Since the electrode HV1 was immersed in the aqueous buffer solution, electro-chemical reactions at the surface of HV1 electrode might generate bubbles over a long experimental duration (2H2O + 2e−=H2 + 2OH−). The use of redox buffers suggested by Moini [37] together with shaper electrode at HV1 and reduced separation voltage could reduce the generation of bubbles in practice. Solvent flow rate is another important parameter, which would affect both MCE separation and electrospray efficiencies. Straight nanoESIs equipping with different capillaries were tested at different flow rates. Fig. 2b shows that straight nanoESIs with 50 and 75 μm capillaries have similar signal intensities, which are about 100 times higher than that of straight nanoESI with a 100 μm capillary. In all cases, signal intensity rose up as we increased the solvent flow rate, and capillaries with bigger i.d. require higher flow rates. When the flow rate was too low, such as< 10 μL/h, gas bubbles could be observed at the end of the capillary. It was believed that gas bubbles are due to the fact that the solvent flow rate could not match that of the electrospray speed. When bubble appeared, discontinuous and unstable spray was observed. When the flow rate is too high, such as> 120 μL/h, liquid\ndroplets could be observed at the tip of the spray needle, which also lowered the ionization efficiency. In general, a flow rate between 10 and 100 μL/h was acceptable for straight nanoESI with a capillary i.d. of 50 or 75 μm. Relative position of the stainless-steel needle with respect to the glass capillary is critical in terms of performances. Liquid sample inside the capillary needs to be effectively delivered to the tip of the needle. Distance between the sharp tip of the stainless-steel needle with the end of the capillary was then tested with the results shown in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that an optimized distance (l=200 μm) exists. Liquid sample flows along the needle after it existed the capillary, and evaporation happens during this process. Therefore, if l was too long, samples might not be able to reach the electrospray tip, which might account for the sharp ion intensity drop as l was increased from ~200 μm to ~525 μm in Fig. 1c. On the other hand, if l was too short, liquid stream might not be able to merge/attach fluently onto the needle, which would result in liquid droplets at the tip. After all the above optimization, 75 μm i.d. capillary, l=200 μm, and ~3500 V ionization voltage were used in later experiments. Next, performances of this straight nanoESI was compared to those of a commercial nanoESI. Using reserpine (20 μg/mL) as the sample, Fig. 3a compares the ion intensities at different liquid flow rates. The commercial nanoESI emitter has a tapered tip (~19 μm). Distance between the end of the emitter and MS inlet were kept the same in all experiments, and other parameters were optimized for both the straight nanoESI and the commercial nanoESI emitter. For instance, 3500 V was found to be the optimized voltage for the straight nanoESI with increased flow rate and opening, and 1750 V for the commercial nanoESI tip. To avoid breakage and blockage of tip, flow rate was varied from 10 to 50 μL/h for the commercial nanoESI emitter. Besides capable of working at higher flow rates, the straight nanoESI source could also provide higher ion intensities at different flow rates. An ion intensity enhancement of ~13.37, 14.18, 22.64 and 15.12 times were achieved at the flow rate of 20, 30, 40 and 50 μL/h, respectively. This may due to the fact that the stainless-steel has a sharper tip than 19 μm, and thus a higher ionization efficiency could be achieved with the smaller ionization aperture [38]. Additionally, a conventional ESI source (the Agilent Jet Steam Technology) was also tested for comparison. Since the ESI source has much larger flow rates, results were plotted separately in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary information. As shown in Fig. S1, the ion intensity is on the level of 106, which is about 10 times lower than those from the straight nanoESI source. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the straight nanoESI was also explored for reserpine. As shown in Fig. 3b, a good linear range was achieved within 5–5000 ng/mL (R2=0.9905). A signal to noise (S/N) ratio of 10 was obtained at 10 ng/mL (Fig. 3c), and a S/N of 3 was achieved at 5 ng/mL (Fig. 3d). Without applying separation voltages, straight nanoESI could be\nused as a typical nanoESI source. By applying a separation voltage on HV1 and switching the micro valve between sample syringe and the nano pump (Fig. 1a), straight nanoESI was then applied to couple MCE with MS. The MCE-MS system was first evaluated using a mixture of phenylalanine (3.7 μg/mL), bradykinin (10 μg/mL) and angiotensin II (16 μg/mL). A 10 s sample injection time was used in this work corresponding to a sample injection volume of 33.3 nL, which was less than 1.8% of the total volume of the 40 cm long separation capillary. Without turning on HV1 and having a solvent flow rate of 15 μL/h, a single peak was observed in the TIC of the electropherogram as shown in Fig. 4a. Three repeated experiments were carried out to test system reproducibility. Retention time of this peak is stable with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.28%, and RSD of the peak area is 9.73%. Results show that the use of a nano pump to provide a constant liquid flow instead of using EOFs could make satisfactory system stability and reproducibility. The peak tailing effect in Fig. 4a could be attributed to\nthe electro-migration dispersion effect caused by the different charge concentrations between the sample band and the solvent. On the other hand, without the need to generate EOF, inner walls of the capillaries used in this work were not activated, which in turn helps minimizing ion absorptions on the capillary inner surface. To achieve mixture separation, a high DC voltage was applied on HV1 after sample injection, the constant liquid flow provided by the nano pump pushed analyte ions forward, while the electric field generated by HV1 pulled analyte ions backward, and separation of these three analytes in Fig. 4a was achieved. With a −7 kV DC separation voltage on HV1, these three analytes were separated in MCE. Fig. 4b plots the relative EIC intensities of three ions at m/z 166.06, 523.77 and 530.78 Th, which correspond to phenylalanine, angiotensin II and bradykinin, respectively. By replacing EOF with a laminar flow in MCE, ion hydrodynamic motion within the separation channel was precisely controlled, so that ion hydrodynamic radius was calculated from the\npeak retention time. As a tradeoff, reduced ion separation efficiency and broader peaks were also observed in MCE experiments. Performances of this straight nanoESI interfaced MCE-MS was further characterized by analyzing the mixture of five compounds: an amino acid, phenylalanine (10 μg/mL); two peptides, bradykinin (10 μg/mL) and angiotensin II (16 μg/mL); two proteins, lysozyme (200 μg/mL) and cytochrome C (500 μg/mL). As shown in Fig. 5, these five compounds could be well separated in the MCE domain, as well as in the MS domain. Phenylalanine was first eluted, followed by angiotensin II, bradykinin, and then cytochrome C and lysozyme. In general, these two proteins would have larger effective radiuses than those of these two peptides, and these two peptides are also larger than the amino acid. Larger ions would feel stronger hydrodynamic forces from the constant liquid flow, which was pushing them forward. Experiments in Fig. 5 show that small ions generally have shorter elution time than those of large ions, indicating that small ions actually travel faster than large ions in MCE. This could be explained by the relatively lower effective charge states of small ions at low pH conditions (pH=3.0) in\nMCE experiments. These results suggest that effective charge state of an ion would have larger impacts on its migration within MCE experiments. With the capability of accurately measuring ion migration times within MCE, equivalent radius of these analytes could be obtained. Equation (1) was used to calculate ion hydrodynamic radius from ion migration time, and details about formula derivation could be found in a previous publication [33].\n+ + =v qU t qU L m e S1carrier L mt 2 (1)\nin which q is the amount of electric charge possessed by the ion, m is the relative molecular mass, the optimized electric potential (U) applied across the separation capillary is 7000 V and L is the length of effective separation capillary (0.4 m). The ion migration time t needed to calculate the parameter ξ was measured as the ion retention/elution time in the EIC spectrum, and the ion equivalent radius (R) is calculated by solving the governing equation (ξ=6πηR), which is originated from a\nviscous drag force caused by the velocity difference between liquid flow and ions. η is the viscosity coefficient of the solution (13.6×10−4 Pa s) in this work. In conventional MCE experiments performed on a modified CE instrument, a neutral marker (such as DMSO) was used to calibrate the constant liquid flow rate. Since neutral markers could not be ionized and detected in a MS experiment, the liquid flow rate was calibrated by measuring the ion elution time within MCE without applying the separation voltage. As shown in Fig. 4a, ion elution time in the whole capillary (the separation capillary 40 cm plus the ESI spray tip 7.5 cm) without the application of the separation voltage was 8.03min. Therefore, the liquid flow rate (vcarrier) was calculated as 47.5 cm/8.03min, which was 9.86×10−4m/s. Charge state of the sample in aqueous solution can be obtained using PROPKA (http://nbcr-222. ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr_2.0.0/). It should be noticed that ion effective charge states in liquid phase in the MCE experiments are different from the ion charge states in the gas phase in MS experiments. In this work, an acid solvent at pH 3.0 with the addition of ACN was used primarily for optimized ESI. This non-native solvent condition would affect conformations of protein ions. Therefore, the effective radiuses of proteins were not calculated. Table 1 shows the calculated ion hydrodynamic radiuses of two peptides: angiotensin II and bradykinin, and results were consistent with those from literatures [39,40]. As a variance of CE and a liquid-phase correspondence to IMS, this MCE-MS based method could be used as a liquid phase ion separation and structure analysis technique, which could potentially be extended in large scale complex sample analyses."

    "abstractText" : "Mobility capillary electrophoresis (MCE) was developed previously in our group, which has the capabilities of ion separation and biomolecule hydrodynamic radius analysis. The coupling of MCE with mass spectrometry (MS) would greatly improve complex sample identification capability as well as system detection sensitivity. In the present study, a simple and robust ionization source, named as straight nano-electrospray ionization (nanoESI) source was developed, which was applied to couple MCE with MS. A stainless-steel needle attached directly at the end of an MCE capillary was used as the nanoESI emitter, and the connection between this emitter to the liquid flow in the MCE separation channel was established through a liquid bridge. After optimization, this straight nanoESI source enhanced the ion signal intensity by ~10 times when compared with a commercial nanoESI source. The MCE-straight nanoESI-MS system was also characterized in terms of mixture separation and peptide hydrodynamic radius measurements. Compared to our previous work when a UV detector was used in a commercial Lumex CE system (model Capel 105M, St. Petersburg, Russia), peptides with much lower concentrations could be analyzed (from ~1mg/mL to ~20 μg/mL) in terms of radius measurement.",
