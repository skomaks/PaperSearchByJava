In this paper, we employed a facile ammonia etching approach followed by 1H,1H,2H,2HPerfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES) modification to fabricate micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surface as an effective layer for corrosion inhibition and bio-adhesion suppression.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to depict the chemical components of the micro-nano textured AA5083 surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to confirm the presence of functional groups of fluorinated carbon with low surface energy. The self-cleaning ability and corrosion resistance of the fabricated surfaces were investigated, suggesting an excellent water-proofing and anti-corrosion performance. Moreover, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was chosen as a typical bacteria to evaluate and demonstrate the anti-adhesion property of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface.

All r\nhreaten the service performance and security of structural AA5083\naterials.\nRecent years, nature-inspired [7–11] biomimetic superhyrophobic surface arouses tremendous attention due to its otential applications such as self-cleaning [12,13] , oil-water sepration [14–16] , drag reduction [17,18] , water collection [19,20] , nti-icing/frosting [21,22] etc . And more importantly, owing to the ypical Cassie contacts and fascinating water repellence properties,\netallic superhydrophobic surfaces are viewed as one of the ost promising protective materials against marine corrosion ttack. Heretofore, some artificial superhydrophobic surfaces have een developed to enhance the corrosion resistance of various\netallic or alloy substrates, such as copper [23] , zinc [24] , aluinum [25] , carbon steel [26] , Mg alloys [27] etc. For instance, an et al. [28] fabricated superhydrophobic surface on copper ubstrate and demonstrated the superior corrosion resistance nd long-term stability. Li et al. [29] prepared superhydrophobic\nights reserved.\n2\ns e v t d 8\nd ( d b t A ( t w t T f\n2\ni n e e a t r 1 ( t t\n2\nC c v c h p 0 t a n t p g\ns i A a t 1 d o\nAZ61 Mg surface with peony-like microstructures and presented a significantly decreasing of the corrosion current density. Karthik et al. [30] reported the fabrication and anticorrosive performance of superhydrophobic aluminum surface, presenting a remarkable improvement of charge transfer resistance with 2 orders of magnitude higher than pristine substrate. According to the relevant literatures, it is believed that the transformation from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic on aluminum substrates are expected to be a promising strategy towards marine corrosion inhibition and bio-fouling suppression.\nTo date, the achieving of superhydrophobicity on aluminum alloy substrates have not received due attention. In view of the key role of aluminum alloys in marine environmental applications, it is highly desirable and necessary to impart excellent corrosion resistant and anti-bioadhesion ability to aluminum alloys. Nevertheless, there are quite limited reports about the design and fabrication of superhydrophobic surface on aluminum alloy substrates up to now, especially the extensively used AA5083. Furthermore, there has no reports about the detailed investigation of superhydrophobic AA5083 surface for corrosion protection and bio-adhesion control.\nThus, in this paper, facile etching-textured superhydrophobic AA5083 with micro-nano hierarchical structure was fabricated through ammonia etching and 1H,1H,2H,2HPerfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES) modification. The surface morphologies, chemical compositions and wettability behavior of sanded AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 were investigated. The corrosion resistance was evaluated and analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectra. In addition, as an extensively marine existed microorganisms, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was chosen as a typical bacteria to evaluate the anti-bioadhesion performance of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083. This research work demonstrates the micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surface can be employed as an effective barrier toward marine corrosion inhibition and SRB-adhesion suppression.\n2. Experimental section\n2.1. Materials and reagents\n5083 Aluminum alloy (AA5083, Composition: 4.0 ∼4.9% Mg, 0.4 ∼1.0% Mn, 0.4% Si, 0.1% Cu, 0.25% Zn, 0.15% Ti, 0.05–0.25% Cr, 0.1–0.4% Fe and the balance is Al) with 0.3 mm thickness was used as substrates. 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES, C 16 F 17 H 19 O 3 Si, 96%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. DAPI solution (10 μg/mL) was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd. All other reagents (anhydrous ethanol, ammonia water, glutaraldehyde solution etc . ) are purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Regeant Co., Ltd. with analytical grade and utilized as received. The deionized water with 18.0 M ·cm resistivity was employed during the whole experiments.\n2.2. Fabrication of superhydrophobic AA5083\nAA5083 specimen was firstly sanded with SiC paper (20 0, 40 0, 80 0, 120 0, 20 0 0 grade) successively. Then the substrate was ultrasonically cleaned in anhydrous alcohol and deionized water for 10 min respectively. The cleaned specimen was then promptly transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined hydrothermal reactor with 2 vol.% aqueous solution of ammonia and heated at 90 °C for 5 h. After the reaction, the sample was taken out and rinsed thoroughly using anhydrous alcohol. Then the specimen was immersed in 1 vol.% PFDTES/anhydrous alcohol solution for 10 min, followed by heating in drying oven for 10 min under 120 °C.\n.3. Characterizations\nThe surface topographies were recorded using field-emission canning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-3400 N, Japan) quipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) under a acuum environment at 15 kV. The roughness and 3D images of he sanded AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces were etermined through an atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode\nBruker, Germany).\nWater contact angle (WCA) measurements about superhyrophobic AA5083 surface was determined by Dataphysics OCA25 Germany) at room temperature. In typical process, a 4 uL water roplet was carefully placed upon the as-prepared superhydrophoic surface. The CA value was the average of five different posiions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of micro-nano textured\nA5083 surface was recorded with an Ultima IV diffractometer\nRigaku, Japan) with the 2 θ ranging from 10 ° to 80 ° X-ray phooelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi)\nas employed at a chamber pressure below 10 −8 Torr to reveal he chemical components of the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. he binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.8 eV rom adventitious carbon.\n.4. Electrochemical experiments\nThe electrochemical experiments were carried out by immersng the specimens in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution using Zen-\nium Pro (Zahner, Germany). In a typical process, a standard threelectrode system was used to perform the electrochemical tests quipped with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a platinum mesh s the counter electrode and the specimens as the working elecrode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was caried out at open circuit potential (OCP) in the frequency range of 0 5 Hz to 10 −2 Hz. Before every electrochemical test, the samples with 1 cm 2 area exposure) were immersed in solution for more han 60 min to stabilize. The EIS results were analyzed through fiting data via ZsimpWin software.\n.5. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) cultivation and bioadhesion tests\nThe SRB seed was isolated from marine sludge (Bohai Sea, hina). The purified seawater employed in this experiment was ollected from Huiquan Bay (Qingdao, China). In a typical cultiation process, SRB cultures were inoculated in sterile Postgate’s ulture (PGC) medium with a pH = 7 (adjusted by 0.05 M sodium ydroxide). The medium contains 0.5 g dipotassium hydrogen hosphate, 1.0 g ammonium chloride, 0.06 g calcium chloride, .06 g magnesium sulphate, 0.3 g sodium citrate, 1.0 g yeast exract, and 6 mL sodium lactate (70%) in 1 L aged seawater. The s-prepared solution was degassed by purging with high-purity itrogen and then autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. After cooling, he culture solution was inoculated with bacteria at room temerature. The SRB culture was then sealed and stored in sterilized lass bottles at 30 °C in a temperature incubator. The sterilized (ultraviolet radiation, 30 min) sanded AA5083 and uperhydrophobic AA5083 specimens were vertically suspended nto the 3-day-old culture medium for a certain period of time.\nfter the bioadhesion tests, the samples were taken out gently nd treated with sterilized 5% glutaraldehyde/PBS for 30 min. Then, he specimens were stained with acridine orange solution (AO, 0 μg/mL). After the staining, the SRB adhesion was observed uner a fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX-51). The SRB coverage f different samples were analyzed using software ImageJ.\n3\n3\na S s c A f s n f g d s d t\nd t m t s a p t a i s a l t\ns t d d\nw w s\ns s\np a 1 t s t t t p i t a\nf h r d w A s b t i a c\n. Results and discussion\n.1. Surface morphology and wettability\nThe surface topographies and roughness of sanded AA5083 and s-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 were characterized using EM and AFM. Fig. 1 a presents that the surface of sanded AA5083 urface is so smooth and flat that no obvious micro-structures an be observed. The AFM tapping mode 3D image of the sanded A5083 surface was shown in Fig. 1 d, demonstrating a low surace average roughness, viz , R a = 23.8 nm. As for the as-prepared uperhydrophobic AA5083 surface, Fig. 1 b depicts the low mag-\nification of SEM image, featuring with a typical micro triangular\nrustum of pyramids morphology. Large amounts of micro trianular frustum of pyramids with 1 ∼3 μm size were generated and istributed evenly on the as-produced superhydrophobic AA5083 urface. As a comparison, the average roughness of the superhy-\nrophobic AA5083 surface was 570 nm, which is much higher than hat of sanded AA5083 surface.\nIn addition, the magnified SEM image of resultant superhyrophobic AA5083 surface was shown in Fig. 1 c. It reveals that he micro triangular frustum of pyramids were comprised with\nany terrace-like nano structures. The representative micro-nano extured hierarchical structure of the superhydrophobic AA5083 urface with higher roughness and lower surface energy plays\nsignificant role in determining the ultimate water-repellence roperty. The superhydrophobic AA5083 surface features with ypical Cassie-Baxter contact mode with a static water contact ngle as high as 167.8 ± 1.5 ° and a sliding angle of 2 ± 1 ° The nterspace of the micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 urface entraps large quantity of air, result in the formation of n air cushion. The higher liquid-air interfacial contact area and ower liquid-solid contact area are advantageous in bringing about he eventually surface superhydrophobicity.\nAs depicted in the reported literatures [31–34] , roughness and urface energy determine the wettability of a solid surface. Given he typical Cassie-Baxter contact of the as-fabricated superhyrophobic AA5083 surface, we employ the following equations to epict the heterogeneous wetting regime [35,36] :\nf 1 cos θ = cos θr + f 2 (1)\nf 1 + f 2 = 1 (2) here ƒ1 is the contact fraction of the as-fabricated surface with ater droplet; ƒ2 is the contact fraction of trapped air among the\nurface structure and water droplet. And θ and θ r represent the\ntatic water contact angles of modified smooth surface and the reultant superhydrophobic AA5083 surface.\nIn this case, the static water contact angle of the resultant suerhydrophobic AA5083 surface ( θ r ) is 167.8 °, while the contact ngle of PFDTES modified smooth surface ( θ ) is approximately 20 °. According to the above-mentioned equations, we calculated he liquid-solid ( ƒ1 ) and liquid-air ( ƒ2 ) contact area fraction of the urface, viz , ƒ1 = 0.0452 and ƒ2 = 0.9548. It suggests that the conact area between the air trapped below and water droplet is esimated to be 95.48%. It is demonstrated that large amount of air rapped among the micro-nano hierarchical structure, forming air ocket. The existence of this air cushion could greatly increase the nterfacial air-liquid contact area, effectively preventing the infilration of liquids into the substrates. It is also the main reason to chieve excellent surface superhydrophobicity.\nFig. 2 presents the wettability characteristics of the asabricated micro-nano textured and PFDTES modified superydrophobic AA5083 surface, including static water droplets, eflection of water flow and self-cleaning ability. Firstly, water\nroplets were dropped upon the micro-nano textured surface\nithout modification and PFDTES modified superhydrophobic A5083 surface. The photograph recorded using camera was hown in Fig. 2 a, which noticeably presenting the great difference etween these two surfaces. The water droplets quickly moisten he micro-nano textured AA5083 surface and spread into the nterspaces of the micro-nano hierarchical structures, revealing\ntypical superhydrophilic state (water contact angle ∼ 0 °). In ontrast, the water droplets on the superhydrophobic AA5083\nt t h - i p s a p T 3 ( p l f o i A\n3\nd t F t E i d t n b t q o t s\ni A o d c s m c w\nsurface can exhibit a Cassie contact mode, presenting emblematic globular standing. Hence, we can confirm that PFDTES modification is of great importance in changing surface superhydrophilicity to superhydrophobicity.\nThen, in order to further confirm the low water adhesion force, jets of water flow was employed to shoot the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface at a certain angle, as shown in Fig. 2 b and 2 c. Jets of water flow could bounce off the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface without leaving any trace on the surface, just like a reflecting light, suggesting the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface possesses excellent water repellency. Moreover, the self-cleaning ability of the micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surface was investigated using black graphite powder as contaminations, as presented in Fig. 2 d, 2 e and 2 f. With water dropping, the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface are extremely water-repellent, making water droplets rolling down the surface easily. The superhydrophobic AA5083 surface exhibits un-wetted as the dropping water carry away the contaminated graphite powder, demonstrating excellent lotus effect. The above static and dynamic tests intuitively reflect the characteristic of surface wettability and can be ascribed to the water proofing performance of the fabricated surfaces.\n3.2. Chemical components\nFig. 3 a reveals the XRD pattern of the as-prepared micronano textured AA5083 through ammonia solution etching. Except those marked with rectangles arising from the AA5083 substrate (Al, JCPDS file No. 04-0787), it can be seen obviously that the sharp and intensive peaks marked with triangle are indexed to the bayerite (Al(OH) 3 , JCPDS file No. 20-0011). The sharp peaks of Al(OH) 3 indicate the presence of highly crystalline and coarse particles. In addition, some weak peaks marked with black solid rhombus can also be observed, suggesting the formation and existence of boehmite ( γ -AlOOH, JCPDS file No. 21-1307). The resultant surface products are consistent with the data reported in the relevant literatures [37,38] . The EDS analysis of the resultant surface was shown in Fig. 3 b, which shows the existence of both Al and O elements. Quantitative results reveal that the atomic ratio of O/Al of the micro-nano texture AA5083 surface is about 2.79, which further demonstrating the formation and co-existence of bayerite (Al(OH) 3 ) and boehmite ( γ -AlOOH). In this work, the micro-nano textured AA5083 was modified with PFDTES, which possesses C-F groups with extremely low surface energy. The chemical compositions of the resultant superhydrophobic AA5083 surface was analyzed using XPS shown in Fig. 4 . XPS analysis shown in Fig. 4 a detected and confirmed\nhe presence of C1s, O1s, F1s, Si2p (102.7 eV), Al2p (74.18 eV) on he as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. As shown in igh-resolution of C1s spectrum of Fig. 4 b, the -CF3 (293.7 eV), CF2 (291.2 eV) and -C-C (284.6 eV) peaks can be easily recognized, ndicating high content of linked PFDTES molecules on the su-\nerhydrophobic AA5083 surface. In addition, the high resolution pectrum of O1s ( Fig. 4 c) was attributed to both -O-Si- (531.4 eV) nd -O-C- (532.2 eV). The strong binding energy of F1s ( Fig. 4 d) eak can be found at 688.3 eV, attributing to F-C covalent bond. he atomic percentage of C and F element is about 22.16% and 4.28%, respectively, which were much higher that of Al element 10.56%). It is indicated that the outermost surface of the asrepared AA5083 was comprised by –CF 3 and –CF 2 groups with ow surface energy. Briefly, these XPS peaks suggested the successully modification of PFDTES molecules and evidently decreasing\nf the surface energy of the micro-nano textured AA5083, which\ns of great significance forming the eventually superhydrophobic\nA5083 surface.\n.3. Anti-corrosion performance\nThe corrosion behavior of the sanded AA5083 and superhyrophobic AA5083 surface was further investigated through elecrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements, as shown in ig. 5 (a–c). The EIS contains significant information concerning he kinetics of the corrosion process occurring. Fig. 5 a reveals the IS plots of sanded AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surface n 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The Nyquist plot in Fig. 5 a (black line)\nepicts that the sanded AA5083 is characterized with two capaciive loop. As shown in Fig. 5 c, two time constants can be recogized, which are attributed to the oxide layer and electric doule layer. For superhydrophobic AA5083 surface (blue line), three ime constants can be found in bode plots of phase angle vs. freuency ( Fig. 5 c). The three time constants observed from EIS plots f superhydrophobic AA5083 reflect three electrochemical evoluion processes, including electrochemical deterioration stages of uperhydrophobic layer, oxide layer and AA5083 substrate.\nAccording to the bode plots of log |Z| vs. frequency, as shown n Fig. 5 b, the impedance modulus values of superhydrophobic\nA5083 surface is nearly 3 orders of magnitude higher than that f sanded AA5083 surface. The reasons of the large modulus ifference between sanded AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 an be attributed to the surface wettability. The sanded AA5083 urface can be easily wetted when contacting with corrosion\nedium, leading to the dissolution and pitting corrosion of Al. In ontrast, the superhydrophobic AA5083 surface exhibits excellent\nater proofing property. The liquid droplets and corrosion medium\nc t t u i i u | h b t s\np a\nontact the solid surface with a typical Cassie-Baxter mode. Thus, he superhydrophobic AA5083 surface can effectively prevent he infiltration of water, chloride ions and oxygen ion into the nderlying AA5083 substrate. In addition, the air cushion trapped n the micro-nano textured hierarchical structures can dramatically ncrease the charge transfer resistance, leading to the higher mod-\nlus of superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. The greatly improved\nZ| demonstrates that the as-fabricated micro-nano textured super-\nydrophobic AA5083 surface can change the interfacial properties etween substrate and corrosion medium, which greatly enhance he corrosion resistance and inhibit the corroding of AA5083 ubstrate.\nGiven in the analysis above, the EIS spectra can be fitted emloying equivalent circuits as revealed in Fig. 6 a (Sanded AA5083) nd Fig. 6 b (Superhydrophobic AA5083). In these two equivalent\nc\nη\nw A o\ne b i s i t e o t r a\n3\nt v b b m\ncircuits, R s , R f , R oxide and R ct represent the solution resistance, superhydrophobic film resistance, oxide layer resistance and charge transfer resistance, respectively. Q f , Q oxide and Q dl are the constant phase elements (CPE) modelling capacitance of the corrosion product layer, oxide layer and double layer on AA5083 surface, respectively. The impedance of constant phase element Q can be defined as [39,40] :\nZ Q = 1 Y 0 ( jω ) n (3)\nWhere Y 0 , ω, n and j represent modulus, angular frequency, phase, and imaginary number.\nTable 1 shows the electrochemical parameters of simulated sanded AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surface in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. According to the electrochemical parameters in Table 1 , it can be clearly found that the R °ct and R ct values of the sanded AA5083 and superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces are 86 6 6 ·cm 2 and 4.17 × 10 6 ·cm 2 , respectively, presenting greatly enhancement (more than 3 orders of magnitude) of the charge transfer resistance. Moreover, the Q dl values of sanded AA5083 surface and superhydrophobic AA5083 surface are 2.93 × 10 −4 F/cm 2 and 1.69 × 10 −6 F/cm 2 , respectively. The Q dl value of the asfabricated micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surface is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of sanded AA5083 surface. The higher R ct value and lower Q dl value of superhydrophobic AA5083 surface demonstrates the charge transfer process is difficult to happen. Generally, the inhibition efficiency ( η) can be\nalculated using R ct with the following formula [41–43] : ( % ) = ( 1 − R 0 ct\nR ct\n) × 100 (4)\nhere R °ct represents the charge transfer resistance of sanded A5083 surface, and R ct represents the charge transfer resistance f superhydrophobic AA5083 surface.\nAccording to the data from Table 1 , we calculated the inhibition fficiency of the as-prepared micro-nano textured superhydrophoic AA5083 surface, which is approximately 99.79%. This high nhibition efficiency of superhydrophobic AA5083 surface demontrates remarkable anti-corrosion performance. The corrosion nhibition effect can be attributed to the existence of air pocket in he vacancy among the micro-nano hierarchical structures. These lectrochemical results above suggest that the superhydrophobicity\nf AA5083 substrate can provide a stable Cassie-Baxter mode conacts and perform as a prominent barrier against marine corrosion, estricting the closed circuit formation between corrosion medium nd substrates.\n.4. Anti SRB-adhesion property\nAs a major marine bio-fouling threaten, sulfate-reducing baceria (SRB) are extensively existed in seawater and sea mud enironments, playing a key role in microbiologically corrosion and io-adhesion. In this report, SRB are used to investigate the antiioadhesion performance of the sanded AA5083 and as-obtained\nicro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces. Fig. 7 a\n, d) specimens after 3 days and 6 days SRB culture medium immersion experiments.\na s t h f s o t a r\na s s t t T w m a t t s d S 9 p s a m t s f\nw w f l R t g q c w s\n4\ns m p w 2 i I ( a fi o T d c a t a\ne a\nC\nA\nF o t (\nR\n[\n[\n[\n[\nnd 7 b show the fluorescent micrographs of sanded AA5083 and uperhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces after immersion in the SRB culure medium for 3 days. It can be obviously seen that the superydrophobic AA5083 surface appears nearly no SRB adhesion (the raction of SRB coverage is only 0.015%), while the sanded AA5083 urface is covered by many SRB with an approximately coverage f 11.99%. Compared with sanded AA5083 surface, the micro-nano extured superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces can greatly reduce the dhesion, growth, and proliferation of SRB, verifying the crucial ole of superhydrophobicity in anti-bioadhesion.\nIn addition, Fig. 7 c and 7 d present the fluorescent micrographs fter 6 days immersion. Significant decrease of SRB adhesion can till be observed on the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 urfaces with a fraction of SRB coverage of 1.84%. As comparison, he SRB adhesion of sanded AA5083 surface becomes worse than hat of 3 days immersion with the covered SRB fraction of 29.55%. he SRB adhesion experimental results mean that the surface\nettability is an important factor determining the settlement of icroorganisms. According to the coverage data of sanded AA5083\nnd superhydrophobic AA5083 after 3-day and 6-day immersion, he decreasing rate of SRB attachment can be calculated using he formula: ( C 0 –C 1 )/ C 0 , where C 0 represents the SRB coverage of anded AA5083, and C 1 represents the SRB coverage of superhyrophobic AA5083. After the calculation, the decreasing rates of RB attachment after 3-day and 6-day immersion are as high as 9.87% and 93.77%, suggesting good anti-bioadhesion ability of suerhydrophobic AA5083 surface. The mitigation of SRB adhesion of uperhydrophobic AA5083 surface can be attributed to the trapped ir cushion can dramatically minimize the contact between fouling\nicroorganisms and substrate surfaces. Noticeably, the micro-nano extured water proofing and non-stick superhydrophobic AA5083 urface furnishes an environmental benign and effective strategy or anti-bioadhesion and microbiologically corrosion.\nSince the abiotic corrosive and microorganism-containing seaater can be effectively isolated from the metallic substrates, ater-repellent superhydrophobic surface affords a new option or marine anti-corrosion and anti-bioadhesion. However, the ongevity of superhydrophobic surface remains a tricky problem.\necently, we find some latest-published research works presenting hat longer term exposure of superhydrophobic surface in microoranism environments led to loss of the bubble-layer and subseuent bacterial adhesion may be encouraged [44] . Thus, the airushion collapsion of superhydrophobic surface is the core issue\nhich needs to be addressed in the large-scale practical usage of\nuperhydrophobic materials [45] .\n. Conclusion\nIn summary, micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 urface was fabricated via ammonia etching followed with PFDTES\nodification, featuring with a typical micro triangular frustum of\nyramids morphology and terrace-like nano structures. The static ater contact angle is as high as 167.8 ± 1.5 ° and sliding angle ± 1 ° The as-fabricated surface exhibits excellent water proof-\nng property, low water adhesive force and self-cleaning ability. n addition, the charge transfer resistance of the sanded AA5083 R °ct ) and superhydrophobic AA5083 ( R ct ) surfaces are 86 6 6 ·cm 2 nd 4.17 × 10 6 ·cm 2 , respectively, revealing a high inhibition efciency of 99.79%. Significant decrease of SRB adhesion can be\nbserved on the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces. he fraction of SRB coverage is only 0.015% and 1.84% after 3 ays and 6 days SRB culture medium immersion. And the dereasing rates of SRB attachment after 3-day and 6-day immersion re as high as 99.87% and 93.77%. Thus, the design and fabricaion of superhydrophobic AA5083 surfaces are expected to have\nsignificant impact on the development of a new generation of\nnvironmentally benign protective coatings for marine corrosion nd bio-fouling.\nonflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest to declare.\ncknowledgments\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Science oundation of China (Grant no. 41806089 ), the Consulting Project f Chinese Academy of Engineering (Grant no. 2017-XZ-16 ) and he Strategic Priority Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Grant no.

    "abstractText" : "Corrosion attack and undesired bio-adhesion are thorny issues threatening and restricting the service performance and security of the widely used structural 5083 aluminum alloys (AA5083) materials in maritime fields. In this paper, we employed a facile ammonia etching approach followed by 1H,1H,2H,2HPerfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES) modification to fabricate micro-nano textured superhydrophobic AA5083 surface as an effective layer for corrosion inhibition and bio-adhesion suppression. The dual-scale surface morphology and roughness were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to depict the chemical components of the micro-nano textured AA5083 surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to confirm the presence of functional groups of fluorinated carbon with low surface energy. The self-cleaning ability and corrosion resistance of the fabricated surfaces were investigated, suggesting an excellent water-proofing and anti-corrosion performance. Moreover, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was chosen as a typical bacteria to evaluate and demonstrate the anti-adhesion property of the as-fabricated superhydrophobic AA5083 surface. The present study therefore demonstrates that achieving superhydrophobicity on AA5083 substrate is expected to possess quite potential applications in marine corrosion and bio-fouling fields. © 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.
