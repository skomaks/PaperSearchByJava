      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Currently, global warming represents a main menace not only for human health but also for different species of livestock. In Egypt, through the hot months, the elevated ambient temperature is exacerbated by the high relative humidity which is normally over 85% during the day and can reach 100% during the night [1–4]. Recently, the rabbit industry, as a source of animal proteins, has shown an increasing role in the national economies of in Mediterranean regions [5]. However, rabbits are very sensitive to heat stress due to an absence of sweat glands in their skin, except the ear area [4]. Increased oxidative stress induced by thermal stress has been accompanied with significant reduction in the antioxidant defense in the body, inducing inflammatory responses and decreasing feed intake and growth rate, leading to economic losses in the rabbit industry [1,4,6,7].\nSeveral approaches have been developed to avoid the deleterious impacts of thermal stress in animals including the use of phytogenic feed additives, minerals, and vitamins [1–3,7]. Hence, numerous kinds of microelements are used effectively to decrease the injurious effects of heat stress in several animal species and even to avoid their adverse impacts [1,2]. Selenium (Se) is a microelement indispensable in animal health and feeding. It exhibits multiple actions linked to animal production, fertility, and disease prevention [8,9]. Selenium aids the antioxidant enzymes in the body and in turn helps control levels of lipid peroxides and hydrogen peroxide that are formed through ordinary metabolic activity [10]. Likewise, dietary Se is vital for immune system activity, particularly during adverse environmental stressors [10–12]. The bioavailability of selenium is related to its physical form [11]. With the recent progress of the nanotechnology field, nanoselenium (nano-Se) has acquired extensive attention because the nanometer particles display innovative features such as a high surface activity, high catalytic efficiency, large surface area, strong adsorbing ability, and low toxicity [13–15]. Recently, nano-Se has been widely used in poultry nutrition. However, there is a huge concern about the application of the chemical form of nano-Se [16]. The chemical technique can cause hazardous effects for the environment and animals [13,15]. More recently, biosynthesis of nanoparticles is a new tactic for synthesizing nanoparticles that uses plants and microorganisms which have biomedical uses [16–18]. This approach is environmentally friendly, safe, easy to obtain, biocompatible, and cost effective [17].\nHence, we hypothesized that maintainable supports for dietary manipulation constructed on nano-Se supplementations are mainly desirable, especially when reflecting the additional benefits of nano-Se such as cost effectiveness, actual efficiency, and availability. Recently, many reports about different biomedical applications of selenium nanoparticles have been published [18,19]. No investigations have been stated to compare the probable effects of nano-Se synthesized by green or chemical methods in growing rabbits. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the potential effects of chemical or biological synthesized nano-Se on growth efficiency, carcass traits, serum biochemicals, antioxidant status, inflammatory responses, and cecal microbial populations in growing rabbits exposed to thermal stress."

The experiment lasted for eight weeks during summer conditions in Zagazig (30°34′ N, 31°30′ E), Egypt. Growing rabbits were fed the basal diet with nano-selenium (nano-Se) synthesized by biological (BIO) or chemical method (CH). Diet formulation was produced to meet growing requirements according to the National Research Council (NRC). The treatments were as follows: (1) control basal diet (CO); (2 and 3) basal diet + (25 or 50 mg) of biological nano-selenium/kg (BIO25 and BIO50); (4 and 5) basal diet + (25 or 50 mg) of chemical nano-selenium/kg (CH25 or CH50).

All animals were housed under similar environmental, management, and hygienic conditions. Throughout the investigational period, each cage enclosed a pot and feeder to offer free access to fresh water and feed, respectively. Every morning, feces and urine on the rabbit tray floor were removed. Rabbits were exposed to normal light throughout the experimental period.

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "Global warming has been identified as a factor that potentially contributes to the reduction of productivity and economic profit in the rabbit industry. The use of dietary manipulations is an accepted approach that overcomes the adverse influences of thermal stress in rabbits [7,29]. These include dietary minerals, vitamins, essential oils, amino acids, and phytogenic feed additives [2].\nPresently, elemental nano-Se has gained interest owing to its low toxicity, high adsorbing ability, high bioavailability, and high catalytic efficiency in comparison with selenite in chickens [30], sheep [31], and goats [32]. There are several methods for synthesis of nano-Se—chemical methods of nano-Se have been widely used in animals, however, there is a huge concern about the application of chemical forms of nano-Se.\nNumerous microorganism strains can decrease the toxic selenite oxyanion to the less toxic elemental selenium through the biotransformation of either intracellular or extracellular nano-Se,\nwith a typical spherical shape and a diameter of 50–400 nm [18]. Additionally, recent studies with nano-Se (BIO) have established that the particles have anti-biofilm activity against medical isolates of bacterial pathogens [19]. These results may be attributed to the smaller diameters of biologically manufactured nano-Se compared to the chemically manufactured nano-Se. Generally, the biological nano-Se at levels of 50–100 µg/mL was more effective in the destruction of existing biofilm constructions than the inhibition of biofilm formation. In this context, nano-Se synthesized by biological techniques possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties, signifying they could be suitable as therapeutic candidates to combat infectious diseases.\nIn the present study, according to the estimated values of THI (84.07 on average), growing rabbits were suffering from severe heat stress during the experimental period. However, distinct betterment in growth performance, carcass, antioxidants, and inflammatory responses were detected as a consequence of nano-Se (BIO25, BIO50, CH25, and CH50) dietary supplementation.\nThe present research shows that feeding different sources of nano-Se was useful in improving LBW, BWG, FI, and FCR in heat-stressed rabbits compared to the control. Several studies confirmed the ability of a nano-Se diet (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) to remarkably improve the BWG [33] and FCR [33,34] in poultry under heat stress conditions. Similar improvement in growth performance was obtained by Shi et al. [31], who concluded that diets supplemented with nano-Se resulted in enhanced final body weight, BWG, and FCR in guangxi yellow chicken. Boostani et al. [8], reported significant improvement in the BWG of broilers fed diets supplemented with 0.2 mg/kg of organic Se as compared with inorganic Se and the control groups.\nAbdel-Wareth et al. [35] reported significant enhancement in final BW, FCR, and daily BW gain in heat-stressed rabbits supplemented with nano-Se compared to the non-supplemented group. However, feed consumption was not significantly affected by the treatments. In the current study, heat-stressed rabbits supplemented with a biological nano-Se diet (25 or 50 mg/kg) had higher BWG, FC, and FCR compared with the non-supplemented diets. The positive effects of biological nano-Se might be due to its antioxidant activities that enhance the digestion and absorption of nutrients [17]. In accordance with our results, Zhang et al. [36] reported an enhancement in the growth performance of rabbits fed diet supplemented with Se 0.70 mg/kg. In parallel, Zeweil et al. [37] reported that adding different sources of Se to rabbit diets significantly reduced FI and enhanced FCR from 11.5% to 19.4% owing to different treatments compared to the control.\nIn contrast with our results, previous studies have indicated that dietary Se supplementation did not have any influence on the overall broiler performance [34,38]. Additionally, El-Deep et al. [34] indicated that the addition of nano-Se (0.3 mg/kg) into laying hens’ diet did not affect the FI during high environmental temperatures. This might confirm the ability of nano-Se, especially that which is synthesized by biosynthesis method at low levels (25 or 50 mg/kg), to improve the growth performance of growing rabbits in a hot environment through increasing the LBW, BWG, FI, and FCR. The results of the present experiment revealed that the carcass percentage was significantly improved by supplementing the diets with biological nano-Se at a level of 25 mg/kg followed by both BIO50 and CH50 treatments compared with the heat-stressed group.\nThe administration of nano-Se (BIO50 or CH25) reduced blood urea level compared to the control, while the values of GGT and TG for rabbits fed nano-Se (BIO25, BIO50, or CH25) were lower than those of the control group at the end of the experiment. Concerning liver and kidney functions, creatinine and total, direct and indirect bilirubin did not exhibit any significant changes among the groups. Similar to our results, Abdel-Wareth et al. [35] showed that rabbits fed with nano-Se had a significantly lower urea level compared to the control group. Additionally, a significant reduction was reported in the TG level as a response to nano-Se supplementation in broiler chicks [38]. These results concluded that rabbits fed nano-Se had improved liver and kidney functions, thus alleviating the adverse influences of a hot environment. Nano-Se can improve the lipid profile which could be closely connected to the protective roles against heat stress. Moreover, the potential role of selenium-coated nanostructures has also been revealed to be effective in the\ntreatment of fatty liver disease, by enhancing the oral bioavailability and strengthening the hypoglycemic action of phytogenesis [16].\nOur results showed significant decrease in the inflammatory cytokines (IFNᵞ and IL-4) of rabbit serum as affected by nano-Se supplementation. Heat stress could increase the generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to protein degradation and further decline in protein synthesis [1,39]. Excessive production of ROS results in augmented lipid peroxidation, cellular damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses [1,40]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL or TNF-ᵞ) are supposed to be responsible for the detrimental effects of a hot environment. During the exposure to high temperatures, the secretions of cytokines was observed to be increased in animals, suggesting heat load on the animals which can further cause fever, reduce the appetite, and increase energy expenditure and fat mobilization [1,2,4]. The present study shows a reduction in inflammatory cytokines function in rabbits fed nano-Se compared to the control, which reflects the efficacy of nano-Se to enhance animal heath in a hot environment.\nEnhancing animal resistance during adverse environmental stress is an important approach to reduce or avoid several infectious disorders via persuaded immune enhancers and stimulants [2,41]. Nano-Se as feed additives is used in the diets for this purpose. It has been indicated that lysozyme activity is a principal innate immune defense index and hyperthermia might alter the lysozyme activity. In the current study, dietary supplementation of nano-Se (BIO50 or CH25) significantly increased serum lysozyme activity, indicating nanoparticles can improve the innate immune defense of heat stress exposed rabbits.\nThe boost in antioxidant enzyme activities is considered as a protective response against oxidative stress which is generated by heat injury. In our study, nano-Se supplementation in rabbit diets enhanced the antioxidant activities by significantly increasing the activities of GSH and CAT compared to those in the heat stress group, and significantly reduced both NO and MDA levels in the nano-Se treated groups (BIO25, BIO50, or CH25) compared to other groups. It has been reported that dietary inclusion of nano-Se (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) in poultry significantly improved the activity of reduced glutathione (GSH-P) in the serum [34]. Consequently, the immunological activities and protective role of Se, which have been enhanced by the nano-Se addition definitely could alleviate the negative influences on heat-stressed laying hens. Moreover, Zhou et al. [42] showed that Se contributes to several immune functions at all levels, such as minimizing levels and duration of inflammatory infections, reduction of glucocorticoids (indicator for immunity disorder), arrangement of the function of T lymphocytes cells and T killer cells, and activation of IL-2.\nIn broilers, Boostani et al. [8] reported that Se (0.3 mg/kg nano-Se) supplementation significantly augmented the levels of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in comparison with the control group. A detailed examination showed the vital role of Se in antioxidant defense. Se is a vital trace element for combating oxidative stress, and hence the redox state of the cell, because of its integration as selenocysteine into GSH-Px [37] and thioredoxin reductase [1]. In the present work, diet supplementation with nano-Se, (CH25, BIO25, and BIO50) increased the GSH-Px activity in heat-stressed rabbits. This suggests the potential role of nano-Se to overcome the negative impacts of heat stress compared with the control and the high level nano-Se synthesized by chemical method (CH50) group.\nMDA is a sensitive biomarker of lipid peroxidation in the cells. Hence, the higher MDA concentrations observed in heat-stressed rabbits strongly show that the period of heat was indeed stressful to these animals and had undesirable impacts on immune responses [1,43]. Coadministration to heat-stressed rabbits of nano-Se synthesized by biological method had the effect of reducing the NO and MDA production compared with the CH50 and the control groups. Similarly, nano-Se addition into birds’ diets exhibited lowered MDA levels compared to control and stressed birds [8]. The efficiency of nano-Se in the elimination of pathogenic microbes in the digestive tract of animals leads to the creation of a suitable environment for microbes that make up the natural flora found in the stomach and intestines, and enables them to perform their functions more efficiently (Figure 2). The high effectiveness of green synthesis of nano-Se in eliminating pathogens, which provides an appropriate environment for lactic acid bacteria as well as probiotic\nbacteria, improves the metabolism of animals. Probiotics can provide benefits to the host’s intestine through a variety of mechanisms that include competitive exclusion of pathogens, production of antimicrobial compounds, intestinal detoxification, modification of the host’s immune responses, and maintenance of the intestinal barrier [44]. Furthermore, suppression of pathogenic microbes might positively support growth and metabolism of beneficial microorganisms and therefore reflects as improved rabbit performance, as observed in this study."

      "text" : "In view of the above findings, nano-Se is a vital element that helps growing rabbits to cope with the negative impacts of heat stress through many physiological processes. Dietary nano-Se synthesized by biological method at 25 or 50 mg /kg in rabbit diets during heat stress resulted in enhanced growth performance, liver and kidney functions, and antioxidant status and regulated the inflammatory cytokines responses. It is a good and beneficial approach to alleviating the deleterious impacts of thermal stress on growing rabbits. The results showed that the high levels of nano-Se synthesized by chemical method had negative impacts on the antioxidants parameters of growing rabbits.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/3/430/s1.

Therefore, this study intended to compare the potential effects of nano-selenium (nano-Se) synthesized by biological (BIO) and chemical (CH) methods on growth performance, carcass variables, serum metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines responses of growing rabbits in the summer season. Two hundred and fifty weaned rabbits (males, 35 days of age) were randomly divided into five treatment groups of 50 rabbits each (each group had five replicates with ten male rabbits). Treatment groups were fed a control diet and four controlled diets supplemented with nano-Se synthesized by biological method (BIO25 and BIO50, with a 25 and 50 mg of nano-Se/kg diet, respectively) and chemical method (CH25 and CH50, with a 25 and 50 mg of nano-Se/kg diet, respectively) for eight weeks. During 11 to 13 weeks of age, a gradual enhancement in live body weight (LBW), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was noticed with BIO25 and BIO50 treatments compared to those in the other groups. The carcass percentage was significantly higher (p < 0.01) for animals fed with BIO25 than the other groups. The other organ functions were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in heatstressed groups compared to that of nano-Se groups. Increasing the level of only BIO from a 25 to a 50 mg/kg diet gave more improvement in the studied parameters. Additionally, the concentrations of serum urea, triglycerides (TG), and glutamyl transferase (GGT) were lower (p < Animals 2020, 10, 430 2 of 16 0.01) in both treated and untreated groups. Likewise, the supplementation with nano-Se (BIO25, BIO50, or CH25) significantly improved the antioxidant indices and inflammatory cytokines responses as indicated from serum metabolites. Based on the study results, nano-Se especially synthesized by the biological method at diet levels of 25 or 50 mg/kg improved the growth performance, kidney and liver functions, carcass traits, antioxidants indices, and inflammatory cytokines of growing rabbits during thermal stress.",
