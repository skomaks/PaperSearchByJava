The safe dose of selenium in the organism is very narrow, limiting the supplementation of selenium in diet. The aim of this study is to explore whether selenium quantum dots (SeQDs) prevent atherosclerosis and to investigate the potential mechanisms. Methods: An amorphous form of SeQDs (A-SeQDs) and a crystalline form of SeQDs (C-SeQDs) were prepared through self-redox decomposition of selenosulfate precursor. Endothelial dysfunction was induced by balloon injury plus high fat diet (HFD) in rats. Atherosclerotic model was established by feeding Apoe−/− mice with HFD. Results: Administrations of A-SeQDs but not C-SeQDs dramatically improved endothelium-dependent relaxation, and accelerated would healing in primary endothelial cells isolated from rats, which was comprised by cotreatment of LiCl. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) abolished LiCl-induced endothelial dysfunction in rats. In cultured endothelial cells, A-SeQDs, as well as cariporide, inhibited NHE1 activities, decreased intracellular pH value and Ca2+ concentration, and reduced calpain activity increased by ox-LDL. These protective effects of A-SeQDs were reversed by LiCl treatment in endothelial cells. In Apoe−/− mice feeding with HFD, A-SeQDs prevented endothelial dysfunction and reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaque in aortic arteries. Further, lentivirus-mediated NHE1 gene overexpression abolished the protective effects of A-SeQDs against endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in Apoe−/− mice. Conclusion: A-SeQDs prevents endothelial dysfunction and the growth of atherosclerotic plaque through NHE1 inhibition and subsequent inactivation of Ca2+/calpain signaling. Clinically, the administration of A-SeQDs is an effective approach to treat atherosclerosis."

      "text" : "Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease in artery that develops over decades, which is characterized by the fatty deposition in large- and medium-sized arteries [14,35]. In the initiation of atherosclerosis, endothelial cell dysfunction is appeared, leading to the increased transcytosis of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), and its subsequent\ndeposition, retention and modification in the arterial intima [13]. Some new drugs targeting improvement of endothelial dysfunction are effective approaches to prevent atherosclerosis.\nSelenium, as an essential element, plays an important trace mineral in the human body. It is a part of enzymes against free radicals in cells [17], which is firstly reported that selenium is reduced in the areas of atherosclerotic lesions [33]. Till now, many results support the concept\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.vph.2019.01.005 Received 17 September 2018; Received in revised form 8 January 2019; Accepted 25 January 2019\nAbbreviations: NHE1, Na+/H+ exchanger 1; pHi, Intracellular pH value; [Ca2+]i, Intracellular Ca2+ concentration; eNOS, Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase; NO, Nitric Oxide; HUVECs, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Ach, Acetylcholine; SNP, Sodium Nitroprusside; DAF, Diaminofluorescein; HEPES, Hydroxyethyl Piperazine Ethanesulfonic Acid; BCECF, 2-carboxyethyl- 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; A-SeQDs, Amorphous Form of Selenium Quantum Dots; C-SeQDs, Crystalline Form of Selenium Quantum Dots; Ox-LDL, Oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein\n⁎ Corresponding authors.

The speciation of selenium is critical to the health outcomes of selenium supplementation [15]. The safe dose of selenium in the organism is very narrow, and it is easy to produce toxicity, which restricts the application of traditional selenium compounds. Therefore, the development of efficient and safe selenium form is crucial to the efficacy of selenium therapy.\nNanomaterials have been widely used in therapeutics, nano-imaging, and bio-sensing. Compared with the traditional selenium compounds, amorphous nano-selenium is expected to be a new selenium supplement and therapeutic drug because of its unique physical and chemical properties, and high bioavailability [16,22]. We have developed two nanoparticles of selenium quantum dots (SeQDs), namely amorphous SeQDs (A-SeQDs) and crystalline SeQDs (C-SeQDs), and found that A-SeQDs exhibited anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells in a polymorphs-dependent manner [26]. In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of both A-SeQDs and C-SeQDs in atherosclerosis, and found that A-SeQDs prevented endothelial dysfunction in rats and attenuated the growth of atherosclerotic plaque in mice by inactivating Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1)."

      "text" : "We firstly performed in vivo experiments to investigate whether SeQDs produces beneficial effects on endothelial functions in rats fed with high fat diet (HFD). Rats were treated with SeQDs for 2 weeks prior to HFD (Online Fig. S1B). Endothelial function was determined by measuring Ach-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, which is an early marker in atherosclerosis [34]. As shown in Fig. 1A, induction of HFD plus balloon injury in rats (group b) markedly induced endothelial dysfunction in descending aortic arteries, compared to control rats (group a). Consistent with other reports [8], high selenium diet (group c) normalized Ach-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Importantly, administration of A-SeQDs (group e) but not C-SeQDs (group d) at dose of 0.1mg/kg selenium dramatically reversed Ach-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation impaired by HFD, indicating that SeQDs prevents endothelial dysfunction in rats in a polymorphs-dependent manner. Further, the effect of A-SeQDs at this dose (0.1 mg/kg selenium) was stronger than high selenium diet (0.3 mg/kg selenium), implying that delivery of selenium through nanoparticle is much more effective than selenium supplementation through diet.\nBoth A-SeQDs and high selenium diet did not alter SNP-induced vessel relaxation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the improvement of vascular bioactivity by A-SeQDs is due to the maintenance of endothelial function, but not to vascular smooth muscle. Interestingly, A-SeQDs had no effects on TC, TG, LDL, HDL and blood glucose (Online Table S1), implying that the protective effect of A-SeQDs is not related to improve the glucose and lipid metabolisms."

However, treatments of rats with ASeQDs and high selenium diet dramatically increased the minimal diameter of carotid in atherosclerotic rats.\nThe effects of A-SeQDs on reducing the arterial stenosis were further confirmed by measuring the average diameter of retinal artery through fundus photography (Fig. 2C). As calculated in Fig. 2D, the average diameter of retinal artery in rats was significantly reduced, compared with control rats. Both A-SeQDs and high selenium diet administrations remarkably increased the average diameter of retinal artery in atherosclerotic rats."

Thus, we hypothesized that A-SeQDs improves endothelial dysfunction through NHE1 inhibition.

As demonstrated, compared to rats treated with A-SeQDs alone, the effects of A-SeQDs on endothelial dysfunction (Fig. 1A–B), cell proliferations (Fig. 1C and D), the stenosis of carotid (Fig. 2A and B) and retinal arterials (Fig. 2C and D) were ablated by LiCl co-administration.

As shown in Fig. 3A, lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown dramatically inhibited NHE1 mRNA levels in aortic arteries, indicating the high efficiency of lentivirus-mediated gene downregulation in vivo. LiCl administration remarkably impaired Achinduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in rats injected with lentivirus harboring scramble shRNA but not in rats expressing NHE1 shRNA (Fig. 3B). Both LiCl administration and NHE1 shRNA did not\nalter SNP-induced vessel relaxation (Fig. 3C).

      "heading" : "4. Discussion",
      "text" : "In this study, we firstly developed a novel drug of A-SeQDs to prevent endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Our results demonstrated that A-SeQDs but not C-SeQDs inhibited NHE1 activity to inactivate Ca2+/calpain signaling and upregulate eNOS functions in endothelial cells. In vivo gene manipulation of lentivirus-mediated NHE1 overexpression abolished A-SeQDs-increased eNOS activity and improvement of endothelial dysfunction in Apoe−/− mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study is firstly to report that amorphous selenium via inhibition of NHE1 to prevent endothelial dysfunction and\natherosclerosis in vivo. Selenium, an essential trace element, is incorporated into selenoproteins that play a crucial role in human health and disease [8]. Evidence from animal studies shows consistent results that selenium and selenoproteins might prevent experimental atherosclerosis, which can be explained by inhibiting oxidative stress, modulating inflammation, lowering serum lipids, suppressing endothelial dysfunction, and protecting vascular cells against apoptosis and calcification [15,18,19]. Methylated selenium is a good choice for selenium supplementation to correct a deficiency with lower toxicities, compared to selenite. In the absence of a route for adventitious incorporation into proteins, it may be a good choice for future clinical trials of selenium supplementation in disease prevention [32]. In this study, by using nanomaterials, we developed two kinds of nano-selenium particles with different structure and size and observed that A-SeQDs but not C-SeQDs prevented endothelial dysfunction and attenuated the growth of atherosclerotic\nplaque in rats and mice. NHE1 is expressed ubiquitously in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells and exchanges intracellular H+ for extracellular Na+ to regulate pHi value and the concentration of [Na+]i [21]. The activation of NHE1 increases intracellular [Na+]i that leads to Ca2+ overload through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which is assumed to be the crucial factor in diabetic complications [10,20,30,31]. Previous study has also demonstrated that inhibition of NHE1 by cariporide inhibited hyperglycemia-induced inactivation of eNOS through disassociation of hsp90 with eNOS via Ca2+-dependent calpain [27]. In this study, we uncovered a new mechanism that selenium therapy improves endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting NHE1 in endothelial cells. Further, A-SeQDs induced intracellular acidosis to inactivate Ca2+/calpain signaling, resulting in NO production derived from eNOS. In this way, ASeQDs prevents endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis as following evidence. Lentivirus-mediated NHE1 overexpression completely\nabolished A-SeQDs-inhibited atherosclerosis in Apoe−/− mice feeding with HFD.\nBecause lentiviral NHE1 overexpresssion blocked the beneficial effects of A-SeQDs on endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic disease in Apoe−/− mice (Fig. 6D, Online Fig. S2A-S2C), we would expect that A-SeQDs may produce a protective effect on atherosclerosis development or progression as endothelial dysfunction is not only an initiation but also an contributor to the stability of atherosclerotic plaque and rupture to induce myocardial infraction [24]. This needs further investigations.\nAn issue is how A-SeQDs inhibits NHE1 in endothelial cells. We speculated multiple signaling pathways, such as Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase, prostacyclin synthase, microRNAs including miR-133 and miR-199, as the important regulators of endothelial cell functions, may contribute to endothelial dysfunction because these pathways are dysregulated in cardiovascular diseases [3,9,11,12,27,29,37].\nA limitation of this study is that LiCl is used as an NHE1 activator, while it does not specifically affect NHE1 but has many effects on cell metabolism [25]. Thus, it is hard to speculate that cariporide mimics the effects of the quantum dots, which were driven by an effect on NHE1. To determine whether LiCl via NHE1 activation produces protective effects on endothelial dysfunction in rats, we downregulated gene expression of NHE1 by injecting rats with lentivirus expressing NHE1 shRNA followed by LiCl administration. As shown in Fig. 3B, we observed that NHE1 shRNA blocked the detrimental effects of LiCl on endothelial function in rats, indicating the effect of LiCl on endothelial dysfunction is NHE1 dependent. Moreover, the effects of A-SeQDs on endothelial dysfunction in Apoe−/− mice were abolished by lentivirusmediated NHE1 overexpression (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that, as far as endothelial dysfunction, inhibition of NHE1 is, at least, the common pathway shared by cariporide and A-SeQDs.\nIn summary, the present study supports a novel drug of A-SeQDs developed by us, which inhibits NHE1 activity to inactivate Ca2+/calpain signaling to prevent endothelial dysfunction (Online Fig. S2E). As a result, A-SeQDs attenuated the growth of atherosclerotic plaque in\nvivo. The finding that A-SeQDs prevent endothelial dysfunction may have broad applications since endothelial dysfunction is a common character at the beginning and in the progress in a number of vascular diseases including atherosclerosis [2,6], hypertension and diabetes [1].\nAuthor contributions\nM.L.Z. conducted the experiments and analyzed the data.

The safe dose of selenium in the organism is very narrow, limiting the supplementation of selenium in diet. The aim of this study is to explore whether selenium quantum dots (SeQDs) prevent atherosclerosis and to investigate the potential mechanisms. Methods: An amorphous form of SeQDs (A-SeQDs) and a crystalline form of SeQDs (C-SeQDs) were prepared through self-redox decomposition of selenosulfate precursor. Endothelial dysfunction was induced by balloon injury plus high fat diet (HFD) in rats. Atherosclerotic model was established by feeding Apoe mice with",
