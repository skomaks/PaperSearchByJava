      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Nanotechnology involves the manipulation of matter at individual atomic, molecular and sub-molecular levels ( 100 nm). ENPs are the building blocks of engineered nano-materials (ENMs), having novel physico-chemical characteristics such as high surface area to volume ratio, more reactivity, exceptional conductivity and optical properties compared to their bulk counterparts due to large number of surface reactive atoms (John et al., 2017; Lopez-Serrano et al., 2014). ENMs can be classified on the basis of morphology, surface chemistry and core chemical composition (Baalousha, Lead, & Ju-Nam, 2011). Broadly, the ENMs are classified into carbon-based materials, metal and metal oxide, quantum dots (QDs) and organic polymers based on the core chemical composition (Figure 1). In recent years the applications of nanotechnology has grown progressively in many sectors including agriculture, automotive, cosmetics, construction, electronics, environment, food, home appliances, medicine, petroleum, printing, renewable energies, sports and fitness, textile and among others (Bhatt & Tripathi, 2011; Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska, Golimowski, & Urban, 2009; Goswami et al., 2017; Holden et al., 2014; Suresh, Pelletier, & Doktycz, 2013). It is a multibillion dollar industry currently having 8495 nano-enabled products in the market produced by 2070 companies from 56 different countries worldwide (www.product.statnano.com). According to recent HTF market report, global nanotechnology market value is likely to exceed 125 billion US$ by 2024 (HTF Market Report, 2018). In parallel, global production of ENMs was estimated between 2680,000 to 3180,000 metric tons in 2010 and increasing at a\nrate of 25% per annum since that time (Younis, El-Fawal, & Serp, 2018). In order to meet the ever-escalating demand for nano-enabled products, unrestricted massive quantities of ENMs are likely to generate ENPs as a new category of emerging potential environmental contaminants. ENPs are released into the environment during the production process of nanoenabled products, their use phase and life cycle end (Nowack et al., 2012; Vance et al., 2015). Once ENPs are dispersed in the different environmental compartments (air, water, and soil), these are driven away from their pristine nano-state through various physical, chemical and biological transformation processes (Lowry, Gregory, Apte, & Lead, 2012). ENPs properties including, size, shape, surface functionality, in addition to environmental conditions, govern these environmental processes and ultimately altered the fate and behavior of ENPs (Amde, Liu, Tan, & Bekana, 2017). For instance, Ag ENPs sulfidation followed by oxidation process changed the ENPs degree of aggregation, surface reactivity, charge, and potential to release toxic metal ions (Agþ) (Brunetti et al., 2015; Lowry, Espinasse, et al., 2012). Similarly, the interaction of ENPs with natural organic matter (NOM) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) analogs to protein corona in mammals altered the ENPs persistence and toxicity (Adeleye & Keller, 2016; Cornelis, Hund-Rinke, Kuhlbusch, van den Brink, & Nickel, 2014; Domingos, Rafiei, Monteiro, Khan, & Wilkinson, 2013). Thus, humans and other organisms are exposed to environmentally transformed ENPs rather than the pristine particles incorporated in nano-enabled products. Moreover, the atmosphere release of ENPs has implications on global climate change through interaction with various gaseous pollutants (John et al., 2017). The carbon based nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has tendency to combine with the different gases and water vapors and change which change their reactivity (Yu et al., 2015). Recently, Zhao group (Zhao, Su arez, Tran, Puntes, & Riediker, 2019) has found that surface coating of low volatile organic compound (LVOC) vapors on Ag ENPs modify the ENPs surface functionality and enhanced the production of ROS. The innovative economic potential of ENPs has serious concern for human health and ecosystem safety due to their unique nano-scale properties. Recent studies have indicated the negative impacts of different ENPs on living organisms from molecular level to the whole organism in microbes, plants and animals including human beings primarily through the overproduction of ROS (Fajardo, Sacc a, Costa, Nande, & Martin, 2014; Mustafa & Komatsu, 2016; Wu et al., 2018). Other toxicity mechanisms involved the dissolution and release of toxic ions, as well as ENPs physical interaction (Das et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2015). Concerns\nover the safety of ENPs have also been rising due to their bio-accumulation potential and trophic level transfer in food web through the consumption of contaminated food in addition of direct environmental exposure (Tangaa, Selck, Winther-Nielsen, & Khan, 2016). Therefore, timely and integrated review of current knowledge about the environmental transformation and eco-nano-toxicity of ENPs released from various consumer products is needed. Moreover, it is also crucial to monitor the nano-waste in the environment and adopt certain sustainable approaches to obtain maximum benefits of nanotechnology with minimum negative outcomes. In the current review, we discuss the ENPs mobility, and bioavailability to different ecological receptors. The possible mechanisms of nano-toxicity in microbes, plants, and animals including mammals have been discussed. We also proposed certain integrated and eco-friendly strategies for the remediation, and handling of nano-wastes. Finally, we identify key knowledge gaps that need to be considered in future ecological risk assessments studies to prevent the ENPs irreversible ecological damage."

      "heading" : "2. Interaction and impacts of ENPs on microbial community",
      "text" : "Microbial communities in the natural environment are among the most abundant and diversified organisms. These are crucial for normal ecosystem functioning as these perform variety of ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, organic matter (OM) decomposition and degradation of toxic pollutants (Ren et al., 2018; Soliveres et al., 2016). ENPs interaction with microbes alters their community structure and dynamic functioning. In the recent years, a number of studies have been conducted to explore the possible toxicological effects of organic and inorganic ENPs to different microorganisms (bacteria, algae, protozoa, and fungi) inhabiting in aquatic and terrestrial habitats (Deng, Cheng, et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2014). ENPs are bioavailable to microbes either by dissolution and release of toxic ions or directly in nano-form. Microbial toxicity induced by ENPs dependent on the cell intake pathway via endocytosis or phagocytosis (Von Moos, Bowen, & Slaveykova, 2014). The cell membrane damage caused by physical interaction and generation of ROS inside the organisms by the chemical process is the primary cytotoxicity mechanism (Figure 2). Studies have revealed that ENPs can produce severe perturbations in micro-biota. ENPs have an impact on microbes both directly by producing oxidative stress and changing the bio-availability of nutrients or indirectly after interaction with naturally occurring organic compounds (e.g., NOM) and toxic pollutants, thereby alleviating or amplifying the toxicity (Dinesh, Anandaraj, Srinivasan, & Hamza, 2012). The toxic effects of different ENPs to microbial community are presented in Table 1."

      "heading" : "2.1. Nano-toxicity of ENPs to bacteria",
      "text" : "Bacteria are microscopic, usually single celled that thrive in diverse environments. They perform important services in the environment such as fermentation and decomposition processes. The ease of culturing along with ecological importance has made the bacterial community an important group of organisms for eco-nano-toxicity studies. Most commonly used bacteria for nano-toxicity studies belong to genus Bacillus, Pseudomonas (Doody, Wang, Bais, & Jin, 2016; Fajardo et al., 2014), Escherichia (Kaweeteerawat et al., 2015), and nitrifying bacteria (Wu et al., 2018). Some ENPs are incorporated in consumer products due to their antimicrobial activities such as in medical devices, surface coatings, textiles goods and food packaging materials (Hoek, 2010; Mitrano, Limpiteeprakan, Babel, & Nowack, 2016). The degradation of such ENPs incorporated products with time release the product nanoparticles in the environment which upon interaction with bacteria affect their growth, development and other ecosystem services (Fajardo et al., 2014; Soliveres et al., 2016). For instance, Ag ENPs exposure to Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negtive (Escherichia coli) bacteria at environmentally relevant concentration (5mg L 1) for 8 h inhibited their growth and changed the growth kinetics\nFigure 2.

Su group (2015) has found that CuO ENPs upon contact with denitrifying (Paracoccus denitrificans) bacterium at 0.25mg L 1 concentration reduced the organism nitrogen removal efficiency by downregulating GtsB protein and suppressing the expression of key electrontransport-proteins. Other metal oxide ENPs interaction with Azotobacter, nitrifying, phosphorus-and potassium-solubilizing bacteria decreased the microbes growth rate with the inhibition of enzymatic activities (Chai et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018). Carbon-based ENMs (SWCNTs and graphene oxide) inactivate the Gram-positive and Gram-positive bacteria by cell membrane damage and effluxing cytoplasmic materials (Akhavan & Ghaderi, 2010; Jin et al., 2014). For example, soil born exposure of SWCNTs in concentration range between 0.03 to 1mg g 1 reduced the biomass of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as alter the microbial community composition identified through phospholipid fatty acid profile (Jin et al., 2014). ENPs normally attach to bacterial plasma/cell membrane by electrostatic interaction and disturb the membrane integrity. Generally inside the cell toxicity is induced with the trigger of oxidative stress, that is the production of free radicals mainly ROS, protein deactivation and gene expression alteration (Fajardo et al., 2014; Kaweeteerawat et al., 2015). The toxicological effects of various ENPs to different bacterial species are summarized in Table 1."

      "heading" : "2.2. Nano-toxicity of ENPs to algae",
      "text" : "Algae are another group of microbes widely employed in eco-toxicological studies. These are located at bottom of the food web and knowledge about ENPs uptake, bio-accumulation and toxicity in the primary producer is essential as ENPs can be transferred through the food chain to other organisms situated at higher trophic level (Lee, Yoon, Shin, & An, 2015; Pakrashi, Dalai, Chandrasekaran, & Mukherjee, 2014). Studies have shown that primary interaction and uptake of ENPs in different algae species happen through the cell wall. Zhao et al. (2016) upon exposure of CuO ENPs up to 200mg L 1 concentration has identified the bioaccumulation of these ENPs in green algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa followed the adhesion of particles with cells and internalization by endocytosis process. About 50% cellular growth inhibition in green algae Dunaliella tertiolecta and marine diatom Skeletonema costatum were observed in an artificial seawater medium containing silver ENPs at 0.4–6.4mg L 1 concentration (Gambardella et al., 2015). The main detrimental effects on algae cells after their exposure to diverse ENPs are cell membrane damage, reduction in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity, mitochondrial depolarization, oxidative stress, growth inhibition, gene expression alteration and\nproteomic profile change (Deng, Cheng, et al., 2017; Schiavo, Oliviero, Miglietta, Rametta, & Manzo, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). The process of ENPs biomagnification occurs when algal biomass containing ENPs is eaten by higher trophic level consumers. Lee group (2015) has confirmed the one-way flow of Au-nanoparticles in the aquatic food chain from primary producers Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Euglena gracilis to the primary consumer Daphnia magna. When a uni-cellular green algae Chlorella ellipsoides infested cells with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) ENPs at 20–120mg L 1 concentration for 48 h were fed to a water flea Ceriodaphnia dubia, the ENPs bioaccumulated and biomagnification were observed in daphnids (Pakrashi, Dalai, et al., 2014). The bioaccumulated ENPs in primary produces are potentially toxic to the higher trophic level consumer who used these producers as a diet source."

      "text" : "Protozoa are single-celled, eukaryotic organisms inhabiting at damp places. These are either free-living or parasites on other organisms use organic carbon as an energy source. Ecotoxicologists extensively studied the protozoa because of their regulatory role in microbial community structure and function through bacterial ingestion and digestion (Ghafari et al., 2008). Tetrahymena thermophila are valuable model protozoa for the assessment of ENPs toxic effects. Data showing the impacts of various ENPs on different protozoa species is represented in Table 1. ENPs uptake and accumulation in protozoa food vacuole mainly occur through endocytosis and phagocytosis mediated pathways (Ud-Daula, Pfister, & Schramm, 2013; Werlin et al., 2011). ENPs induced toxicity in protozoa through the upregulation of metallothionein genes (Juganson et al., 2017), lowering in the membrane fluidity by changing fatty acid composition (Mortimer, Kasemets, Vodovnik, Marins Ek-Logar, & Kahru, 2011), oxidative stress, reduction in viability and motility (Gupta, Senapati, Dhawan, & Shanker, 2017). Casein coated Ag ENPs exposure to Tetrahymena thermophile at 20mg L 1 concentration for 24 h induced the oxidative stress and up regulate the metallothionein protein. Protozoa have also been tested successfully to evaluate the trophic level transfer of ENPs through the food chain. Werlin et al. (2011) has examined the cadmium accumulation and biomagnification from CdSe QDs in Tetrahymena thermophile with the ingestion of QDs loaded Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. A load of cadmium in protozoa predator was about 5 times higher than the prey organism (bacteria). This biomagnification was due to protozoa higher efficacy of the phagocytosis process and apparently QDs more stability (Werlin et al., 2011). Further, the QDs are bioavailable to higher trophic level organisms\nas protozoa do not undergo lysis. In vivo bio-imaging of ENPs confirmed their three-level trophic transfer in food web from protozoa-(Astasia longa)-to-zooplankton (Moina macrocopa)-to-fish (Danio rerio) (Lee & An, 2015)."

      "text" : "Fungi are the dominant decomposers inhabiting in freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. These play a vital role in the circulation of nutrients and energy in the biosphere with the decay of dead plants and animals (Li, Wang, Bian, Guo, & Cai, 2016). Thus, to ensure the normal ecosystem services, it is crucial to understand the potential toxic effects of ENPs to fungi. Data (Table 1) about ENPs impacts on different species of fungus shows that different toxic effects are induced after the absorption of ENPs through the cell wall. Studies have shown the impact of ENPs on fungi is linked with the cell membrane damage, inhibition of growth, reduced cell density, cytoplasm blebbing, cell death and eventually loss in decomposition activity with reduction in lignocellulolytic enzymes production (Han et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018). When Saccharomyces cerevisiae is exposed to 40–1000mg L 1 cadmium sulfide QDs (CdS QDs) for 24 h, many genes are reprogramed particularly related to abiotic stresses, metabolic pathways, mitochondrion organization, transport and repairing of DNA (Marmiroli et al., 2016). In most of the aforementioned microbial nano-toxicity studies the exposure concentration of different ENPs is quite high (mg L 1/or mg kg 1) than the predicted concentrations (ng L 1/pg L 1/mg kg 1) of ENPs in various technical (sewage treatment sludge, sewage treatment effulent, waste incinerated bottom and fly ash) and natural (soils, sediments, surface and ground water) compartments (Garner, Suh, & Keller, 2017; Giese et al., 2018; Gottschalk et al., 2015). But, in natural environment microbes are continuously exposed to low concentration of ENPs for longer period of time comparative to nano-toxicity studies where exposure level is high and duration is short."

      "text" : "Most likely exposure pathway of ENPs to terrestrial plants is the application of sewage sludge or solid bio-waste to agricultural lands. Solid biowaste is a rich source of nutrients which is an alternative of costly synthetic fertilizers to improve the soil fertility and productivity. For instance, in the US, about 60% solid bio-waste is applied directly to the agricultural fields every year. This solid bio-waste consists of a substantial amount of ENPs,\nas according to an estimate approximately 50% ENPs in WWTPs (wastewater treatment plants) ends up in soil (Keller & Lazareva, 2014). Other sources of ENPs exposure to plants are the atmospheric deposition (John et al., 2017), nano-particles soil application for remediation purpose (Farkas et al., 2015; Nunes et al., 2017), nano-formulated agrochemicals use (Duhan et al., 2017), surface runoff, and wastewater irrigation (Pradas del Real et al., 2016).

      "heading" : "3.1. Uptake, distribution and biotransformation of ENPs in plant",
      "text" : "ENPs present in the environment upon interaction with plants can be internalized in plant tissues either through roots (root tips, suberin-coated roots, lateral roots, cortex, root junctions or wounds) or above ground parts (epidermis, stomata, trichomes, stigma, and hydathodes) (Rizwan et al., 2017). Several physiological and chemical process including cellular signaling, membranes recycling and regulations are involved for ENPs uptake and translocation in plants (Figure 3). Cell wall, a porous network of polysaccharides is the primary barriers in plant cells with the size exclusion limit (SEL) of 5–20 nm allow the acquisition of smaller size ENPs along with water by active/passive transport (Zhao et al., 2012). Once ENPs have internalized in the cell, these transport between cells through cylindrical plasmodesmata channels of 40 nm SEL. Further transport of ENPs may accomplish through endocytosis process and apoplastic/symplastic transport pathway to different plant tissues (Li, Zheng, et al., 2016; Pradas del Real et al., 2017). Translocation of ENPs from root-to-shoot occurs through xylem in case of root-mediated uptake, whereas stomata uptake via aerial exposure causes the phloem based distribution in plants (Ma et al., 2017). Larger size ENPs than the SELs of cell walls, intracellular plasmodesmata channels, and Casparian bands usually internalized through structural modification in cell walls, cuticular interaction or at the site of lateral roots development, where the Casparian band is not fully formed (Wang, Lombi, Zhao, & Kopittke, 2016). Moreover, during the germination stage of plant growth, parenchymatous intercellular spaces and aquaporins (AQPs) gated channels are involved in regulating the plant uptake of ENPs (Miralles, Church, & Harris, 2012). ENPs after cellular internalization accumulate in plant roots or translocate to aerial parts depending on the plant species, ENPs size, type, exposure concentration and duration (Iannone, Groppa, de Sousa, Fern andez van Raap, & Benavides, 2016; Xiong et al., 2017). Knowledge about ENPs localization in subcellular organelles as well as speciation and biotransformation inside plants is critical to understand their nano-impact.

In Medicago sativa L. mercaptopropanoic acid QDs (CdSe/ZnS) particles (4–6 nm) localized inside the nucleus and cytoplasmic regions (Santos et al., 2010). Cu(II) ENPs accumulate in the root cell vacuoles and bio-transformed into different copper species (Cu2O, Cu2S, CuS, CuSO4, Cu2(OH)PO4, Cu-acetate, Cu-citrate, and Cucysteine) upon interaction with biological ligands and even can be reduced to Cu (I) in plant tissues (Dimkpa, Latta, et al., 2013; Yuan, He, Huang, Hua, & Sheng, 2016; Zhao, Ren, et al., 2017). Reducing substances (e.g., ascorbic acids) and organic acids (e.g., citric acids) at nano-bio-interface inside Cucumis sativus roots promote the dissolution of CeO2 (IV) ENPs. The subsequent bio-transformed cerium phosphate (CePO4) needlelike crystals accumulate in roots and cerium carboxylates (Ce(CH3COO)3) translocate into shoot portion (Ma, Zhang, Zhang, He, Zhang, et al., 2015; Zhang, Petersen, et al., 2012). Cerium ENPs accumulate as Ce-acetate, Cecarbonate, Ce-sulfate, Ce-hydroxide in soybean (Glycine max L.) plant, and Zn transform into O-bound Zn compounds (acetate, oxalate, nitrate, and citrate) (Hernandez-Viezcas et al., 2013). Other bio-transformed Zn species has also been reported in the roots, stem, and leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and maize (Zea mays L.) (Dimkpa, Latta, et al., 2013; Lv et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2013). TiO2 rutile phase distributes in the aboveground tissues and anatase particles remain in roots without any dissolution or biotransformation in Cucumis sativus plants. Mesoporous silica nano-particles (MSPs) localized in the cell chloroplast after cellular internalization (Sun et al., 2014). Most abundantly used ferromagnetic Fe3O4 ENPs bio-transformed into ferrous sulfate and ferric citrate in the pumpkin and perennial rye grass roots without translocation to other plant tissues (Wang et al., 2011). Rare earth elements based ENPs (Ytterbium and Lanthanum) have affinity to combine with phosphate or carboxylic group in cucumber (Cucumis sativus), subsequent transformed YbPO4 deposit in root cytoplasm and LaPO4 or lanthanum carboxylates in\nFigure 3.

It has been noted that in wheat roots tissue silver ENPs form complex with thiol-containing molecules followed by oxidative dissolution (Pradas del Real et al., 2017). Intracellular bio-transformation and speciation of ENPs in plants mediate their toxicity at physiomorphological and molecular levels."

      "heading" : "3.2. Phytotoxicity at physio-morphological levels",
      "text" : "A large number of nano-phyto-toxicity studies are currently available showing the positive or negative effects of ENPs in plants (Table 2). In most cases plants show the hormetic response to ENPs application; low dose simulation/beneficial and high dose inhibitory or toxic effects (Bradfield, Kumar, White, & Ebbs, 2017; Iannone et al., 2016; Khodakovskaya et al., 2013). ENPs interaction with plants induces several physiological and morphological changes including impaired seed germination, plant growth inhibition, reduced biomass production, imbalanced nutrients and alteration in photosynthesis and transpiration rates (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016; Rizwan et al., 2017). Intrinsic (system/environment independent; particle size distribution, specific surface area, particle shape, hydrophobicity, chemical composition, redox potential and band gap) and extrinsic (system/environment dependent; density, dustiness, zeta potential, agglomeration rate, dissolution rate and solubility) properties of ENPs determine their nature of interaction and toxicity to different plant species (Wang et al., 2016). Other factors in addition of ENPs properties that influence the nano-phyto-toxicity are the plant type (species), growth stage (germination, flowering, fruiting), culture media (soil or hydroponics) and exposure concentration of ENPs to plants. Cucumber and wheat plants fresh biomass and growth reduced with the waterborne exposure of Ag2S ENPs at an environmentally relevant concentration of 10mg L 1 (Wang et al., 2017). Cu ENPs (10–100 nm) application in soil at rates of 20 or 80mg kg 1 decreased ( 50%) Coriandrum sativum seed germination and also negatively impacted the nutritional quality by reducing macro-(Ca, Mg and S) and micro (B, Mn, Zn) elements content (Zuverza-Mena et al., 2015). During the life cycle of Zea mays L., soil-to-root uptake of ZnO ENPs at 800mg kg 1 exposure level reduces photosynthesis rate (12%), stomatal conductance (15%), chlorophyll content (10%) and eventually economical yield (49%) (Zhao et al., 2015). Rico et al. (2013) reported that 500mg kg 1 soil exposure of CeO2 ENPs to wheat plants during their entire life cycle affected the nutritional quality of wheat grains by modifying the uptake of minerals and assimilation into protein (prolamin, glutelin), fatty acid (lauric and valeric acids) and starch. Generally, the above\nmentioned ENPs phyto-toxicity may occur through following five processes: (1) toxic ions release after partial dissolution, (2) shape or/sizedependent mechanical damage and membranes pore plugging, (3) redoxcycling and Fenton mediated ROS production, (4) binding interaction with proteins (protein-corona) and other biomolecules, (5) biomolecules catalytic oxidation (Yanik & Vardar, 2018)."

      "heading" : "3.3. Biochemical pathways of toxicity: oxidative stress and anti-oxidative defense system",
      "text" : "Biochemical processes in plants during life cycle produces reactive oxygen intermediates (1O2, O2 , H2O2, and HO ) normally called ROS. These ROS are the key signaling transduction molecules in the response of biotic and abiotic environmental stresses and also involved in cellular metabolism, growth, development, and programed cell death (Jagadissgupta & Igamberdiev, 2015). During normal cellular functioning ROS are formed either through redox chain reactions or as metabolic byproducts and localized in different cell organelles such as in chloroplast, mitochondria, and peroxisome (del R ıo, 2015). ENPs mediate photo-toxicity mainly through overproduction of ROS, which could cause protein oxidation, cellular DNA damage, electrolyte leakage with cell membrane lipid peroxidation and eventually apoptotic cell death (Mukherjee et al., 2014; Mustafa & Komatsu, 2016). Plants innate antioxidant defense machinery avoids biomolecules oxidative damage by scavenging the excessive amount of these reactive species with housekeeping enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidants (del R ıo, 2015). Enzymatic antioxidants including ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), catalase (CAT), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), glutathione peroxidase (GPOX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), mono-dehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) helps to maintain the ROS homeostasis in plants (Ma, White, Dhankher, & Xing, 2015). In order to overcome the oxidative stress, specific antioxidant defense enzyme quenches a certain type of ROS through charge transfer mechanism. As a front line of defense CAT, GPOX, and SOD suppresses the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates by rapid neutralization of free radicals. These enzymes catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radical (O2\n) into H2O2 and hydroperoxides and eventually breakdown them to harmless molecules (alcohol/H2O and O2) (Ighodaro & Akinloye, 2018). However during this process produced H2O2 initiate metal ions (Fe\n2þ and Cu2þ) catalyzed Fenton reaction and can generate highly toxic reactive oxygen intermediate HO , which cannot be detoxified with any known antioxidant enzymes (Ma, White, et al., 2015). As a function of 150 lg L 1\nexposure of CuO ENPs, 57% more production of reactive oxygen intermediate HO has been reported in duckweed (Lemna minor L.) chloroplasts (Yue et al., 2018). The simplified process involved in HO formation through Fenton reaction is explained in the following equations: The first step during this reaction is the reduction of ferric ions into ferrous,\nFe3þ þ O2 ! Fe2þ þ O2 (1) This step is called the Fenton reaction: Fe2þ þ H2O2 ! Fe3þ þ OH þ HO (2) Moreover, alternatively through Haber–Weiss reaction hydrogen peroxide can also react with reactive oxygen intermediate (O2 ) to form highly reactive oxygen intermediate HO , expressed in Eq. (3).\nO2 þ H2O2 ! HO þ OH þ O2 (3)\nNormally, ENPs induces oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner and levels of different antioxidant enzymes indicate the activity of the plant defense system in the response of nano-toxicity. Measurement of total ROS by confocal laser scanning microscopy and H2O2, O2\nthrough histochemical staining in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana grown in CeO2 and In2O3 containing medium indicated the oxidative stress. Moreover, the elevated activities of SOD, CAT, APOX, POD, GST, and GR explain the activation of plant defense system in the response of ENPs accumulation in plant tissues (Ma et al., 2016). Wheat plants antioxidant machinery (CAT, APOX, GPOX, SOD) successfully deactivate the reactive oxygen intermediates (H2O2 or O2 ) generated by magnetic iron oxide at 5–20mg L 1 exposure level of ENPs (Iannone et al., 2016). In peas (Pisum sativum L.), ZnO ENPs decreased the plant chlorophyll content with 61% more production of H2O2 and two-fold high lipid peroxidation, an indicator of cell membranes damage, at 500mg kg 1 concentration of ENPs as compared to control. The activities of APOX and CAT were also down-regulated in plants (Mukherjee et al., 2014). Similarly, Ag and CuO ENPs at exposure levels of 1mg L 1 and 1.5mM respectively, caused the severe oxidative burst in rice plants with the elevation of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, a biomarker of lipid oxidation. Moreover, the reduction in total chlorophyll and carotenoids contents was also observed (Nair & Chung, 2014a; Shaw & Hossain, 2013). Even the more production of antioxidants APOX, SOD and the higher ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in nano-treated plants are unable to scavenge reactive oxygen intermediates and prevent oxidative damage (Shaw & Hossain, 2013). Recently, Hao et al. (2018) has observed the\noxidative stress induced cytotoxicity in plants with shrinkage and deformation of roots cortical cells in response of 50mg kg 1 exposure of carbonbased nano-materials (fullerene-C60, MWCNTs (multiwalled carbon nanotubes)) through SOD (Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD) and POD (POD1, POD2 and POD3) isozyme activities disturbance. Mercaptopropanoic acid coated QDs (CdSe/ZnS) localized in Medicago sativa cytoplasm and nucleus and generate ROS in a dose-dependent manner (Santos et al., 2010). Photoactive ENPs upon exposure to sunlight produces ROS through photocatalyzed dissolution process and enhanced the toxicity of these ENPs to organisms. For instance, TiO2 and ZnO ENPs through photosensitization process generate reactive singlet state oxygen (1O2) intermediate in the aerial parts of plants upon exposure to sunlight. The produced 1O2 localized in the cell thylakoid membranes and this is the main reactive oxygen intermediate involved cytotoxicity in the leaves (Li, Zhang, Niu, & Chen, 2012; Triantaphylid es & Havaux, 2009). From the studies, it is clear that the activation of antioxidative machinery to detoxify the produced ROS vary with the ENPs type, plant species and exposure conditions (Table 2). Moreover, at low exposure concentrations of ENPs antioxidants effectively scavenged the generated reactive oxygen intermediates by maintaining equilibrium between ROS production and detoxification. However, in the scenario of higher ENPs concentrations, plants antioxidant defense system fails to protect the cellular organelles from oxidative damages. Non-enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate, proline, tocopherols, plastoquinones, vitamin B6, flavonoids, thiols, carotenoids, and phenolics are also involved in the quenching of reactive oxygen intermediates produced in different plants species under stress conditions (Li et al., 2012; Triantaphylid es & Havaux, 2009). Ascorbate is an important antioxidant involved in the scavenging of superoxide and hydroxyl reactive intermediates and can also convert tocopheroxyl radical into a-tocopherol to prevent the direct membrane damage (Li et al., 2012). Shaw and Hossain (2013) have reported the consistent increase in ascorbate level in the leaves of rice seedlings to quench the produced H2O2 in the response of CuO ENPs. The activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin (a flavonoid), increased 10-fold in Arabidopsis thaliana upon exposure to 1000mg L 1 CeO2 ENPs as compared to control (Ma et al., 2016). The level of proline content elevated 2 times in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in the response of Ag ENPs (1mg L 1) which act as a ROS quencher (Nair & Chung, 2014a). The carotenoids content in plant leaves, which is another non-enzymatic antioxidant, decreased upon cellular uptake of copper and silver nano-particles (Nair & Chung, 2014a; Shaw & Hossain, 2013). Phenolics are another group of compounds which play the role as an antioxidant by quenching free\nradicals, donating electrons or chelating metal ions. Foliar application of Cu(OH)2 nano-pesticides at the concentration of 100mg per plant to maize considerably enhanced ( 24–122%) the biosynthesis of phenolic acid precursors (phenylalanine and 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), p-Coumaric acid and total phenolic contents (Zhao, Hu, Huang, & Keller, 2017). Moreover, the role of above mentioned non-enzymatic antioxidants in the response of ENPs induced oxidative stress to plants is not clear. Therefore further in-depth investigations are required to understand the mechanism of nanotoxicity in plants and defense response of different enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants."

      "text" : "In recent years, the role of ENPs as a potential mutagenic agent is gaining attention upon interaction with plant cells. ENPs induced geno-toxicity mainly through chromosomal aberration, micronuclei induction, disturbing cell cycle as well as alteration of genes expression and protein synthesis involved in the growth regulation, metabolism and biotic or abiotic stress response (Kaveh et al., 2013; Pakrashi, Jain, et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017). The transcriptomic analysis provides important information about the mechanism of ENPs induced genotoxicity through the up and downregulation of genes. In this regard, Arabidopsis thaliana is considered a model plant system for geno-toxic studies due to its smaller genome comparative to other plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptions of 286 genes were up-regulated and 81 genes were down-regulated after treatment of 5mg L 1 polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag ENPs. Primarily upregulated genes were associated with plant defense system (mainly thalianol biosynthesis pathway) in the response of abiotic (metal) and oxidative stress. Whereas, down-regulated genes were related to plants response to pathogens and hormones stimuli (auxin-regulated gene) (Kaveh et al., 2013). In another study environmentally relevant concentration of Ag ENPs (1mg L 1) up-regulated the expression levels of sulfur assimilation and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (Nair & Chung, 2014b). Moreover, CeO2 and In2O5 ENPs differentially modulated the expression of iron-regulating genes (ferric-chelate-reductase, Fe-regulated transporter, and ferritin) in wild-type A. thaliana. The application of real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time PCR) or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in nano-phyto-toxicity studies has made possible to understand the molecular basis of geno-toxicity. In cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants, silver sulfide ENPs exposure at 10mg L 1 concentration altered the expression of genes involved in ethylene signaling pathway, miraculin-like proteins\n(MLPs) and aquaporins. These up and down-regulated genes normally play role in plant development, water transport, defense against bacteria and other pathogens invasion as well as other cellular processes (Wang et al., 2017). Plants (rice, maize) antioxidant defense machinery genes (APX, CAT, FSD, GST1, MSD, POD1) transcription up-regulated in response of CuO (50mg L 1) and Ag (0.5mg L 1) ENPs (Nair & Chung, 2014a; Zhao, Hu, et al., 2017). Metallothionein (MT), a cysteine-rich metal-binding protein, de novo expressed MT gene in wheat roots upon sand born exposure of 2.5mg kg 1 Ag ENPs (Dimkpa, McLean, et al., 2013). TiO2 ENPs up-regulated the expression profile of 11 micro-RNAs in tobacco. These microRNAs are the class of recently discovered small non-coding RNA, play role in plant development, genes modulation, and tolerance against environmental stresses (Frazier, Burklew, & Zhang, 2014). Comet assay is a widely used technique to assess the damage in DNA structure. Even low exposure concentration of TiO2 ENPs (12.5mg L 1) reduced the mitotic index and induced the chromosomal aberration in the onion roots (Allium cepa L.). Microscopic techniques along with comet assay confirmed the chromosome breakage, micronuclei formation, sticky and multipolar chromosomes (Pakrashi, Jain, et al., 2014). In addition of comet assay, DNA laddering assay can be used to investigate the DNA internucleosomal cleavage and plants apoptotic cell death upon interaction with CNTs (Ghosh, Bhadra, Adegoke, Bandyopadhyay, & Mukherjee, 2015). These studies indicate that ENPs upon interaction with plants induced cyto-genotoxic effects and regulate the expression levels of different genes involved in physiological and biochemical processes (Table 2). However, further in-depth studies are required in order to understand the severity of DNA damage, mechanism of plants recovery from DNA damage, and intergenerational transfer of traits to next progeny under the influence of nano-genotoxicity. Moreover, proteomic, and metabolomic studies should also be conducted to understand the complex ENPs interaction with different plant species."

      "text" : "ENMs ever-increasing production and use across wide-ranging sectors releasing a substantial quantities of ENPs (intentionally or unintentionally) into the environment either from the point or non-point sources (Vance et al., 2015). The free dispersible ENPs are produced and used in large quantities and inevitably release into different aquatic environmental systems during production process, use phase, discharge, disposal, recycling, runoff and/or atmospheric deposition. Principally discharge of untreated or\npartially treated wastewater from ENMs production units into water bodies is the potential source of indirect environmental contamination with ENPs (Holden et al., 2014). According to an estimate, 0.1–2% ENPs during the production process is released into the atmosphere, water and soil system (Keller, McFerran, Lazareva, & Suh, 2013). The wastewater effluents are the point source for ENPs; and the discharge of the upstream wastewater treatment plant highly affect the water quality of the downstream drinking water treatment (Zhang et al., 2019). In recent years, a number of ENPs ecotoxicity studies have been conducted using different multicellular organisms inhabiting in aquatic and terrestrial environments (Connolly et al., 2016; Sonane, Moin, & Satish, 2017). Toxic effects of various ENPs to multicellular aquatic and terrestrial organisms are presented in Table 3. An organism’s habitat plays a vital role in determining the ENPs exposure route to the organism. For instance, inhalation or ingestion is the primary intake pathway for the terrestrial organisms, whereas in aquatic organisms, ENPs uptake occurs normally through feeding, dermal absorption and/or gills. In case of gastrointestinal intake with the consumption of ENPs contaminated food, these ENPs are either excreted out or redistributed to other body organs (Lin, Tian, Wu, & Xing, 2010). In the comparison of soil and sediment-dwelling organisms, ENPs are more bioavailable to aquatic biota, where in former case ENPs binding with minerals hinder absorption in organisms. Generally, ENPs interaction with an organism occurs through adsorption on the cell surface, cell membrane internalization, ions release with ENPs dissolution and mechanistic nano-bio-effects (Baker, Tyler, & Galloway, 2014). CNTs primarily interact with epithelial surfaces and induce toxicity without absorption across epithelial membranes (Petersen et al., 2011)."

Diffusion is the dominant trafficking process across membranes for small (<5nm), positively charged and hydrophobic ENPs (Baker et al., 2014). The cellular uptake pathway and mechanism of nano toxicity in multicellular organisms is shown in Figure 4. Perisorption of smaller, positively charged particles may occur through intestine microvilli/villi, enterocyte cells in paracellular-tight junction channels and enterocyte protrusion gaps (Cornelis et al., 2014). Primarily intact ENPs enter the tissues through endocytosis pathway and respiratory or digestive systems epithelial tissue lines are the potential sites for this uptake process. Receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), also known as clathrin-mediated endocytosis directed the ENPs toward the\nTa bl e 3.\nEf fe ct s an d to xi ci ty\nof EN\nPs on\nm ul tic el lu la r aq ua tic\nan d te rr es tr ia lo\nrg an is m s.\nN an om\nat er ia ls\nSi ze\n(n m )\nSu rf ac e co at in g\nTe st\nor ga ni sm\nEx po\nsu re co nc en tr at io n\nEx po\nsu re\ndu ra tio\nn Ex po\nsu re\nm ed ia\nM ai n fin\ndi ng\ns Re fe re nc es\nTi O 2 Zn O\n11 21\n— Ca en or ha bd iti s\nel eg an s (B ris to l (s tr ai n N 2)\n0– 20 0 m g L\n1\n0– 0. 8 m g L\n1 24\nh, 72\nh U ltr ap ur e M ill i-Q\nw at er\nRO S ge ne ra tio n M ac ro m ol ec ul es\nph ys ic al\nda m ag e\nAn tio\nxi da nt s (C ur cu m in\nan d\nvi ta m in -C ) am\nel io ra te d\nth e to xi ci ty\nSo na ne\net al .( 20 17 )\nCa rb on bl ac k (C B)\n20 –7 0\nM od\nifi ed\nCB by\nH 2S O 4,\nH N O 3 an d KM\nnO 4\nEi se ni a fe tid a\n5% (w /w\n) 35\nd an d 60\nd So il m ed iu m\nG ro w th\nin hi bi tio n Su rv iv al ra te\nde cl in e\nox id at iv e st re ss\nZh ao ,H\ne, et\nal .( 20 17 )\nAg 61\n± 0. 6\n42 ± 0. 4\nPo ly vi ny lp\nyr ro lid on e (P VP ), Ci tr at e\nEn ch yt ra eu s cr yp tic us\n25 .6 –2 50 0 m g kg\n1 21\nd Lu fa\nso il\nSu rv iv al\nra te\nan d re pr od\nuc tio n to xi ci ty ne ga tiv el y co rr el at ed w ith so il or ga ni c ca rb on co nt en t\nTo pu\nz an d va n G es te l( 20 17 )\nC 6 0\n— —\nEi se ni a fe tid a\n30 0,\n30 00\nm g kg\n1\n2, 7,\n14 d\nAr tif ic ia ls oi l\nAm in o ac id s (le uc in e, va lin e, is ol eu ci ne an d ph\nen yl al an in e) ,\nnu cl eo si de\n(in os in e)\nan d\nsu ga rs (g lu co se ,m\nal to se )\nco nt en ts\nar e po\nte nt ia l\nbi oi nd\nic at or s of\nC 6 0 N Ps\nex po\nsu re Ac tiv at io n of\nan tio\nxi da nt\nde fe ns e sy st em\nLa nk ad ur ai ,N\nag at o,\nSi m ps on\n,a nd\nSi m ps on\n(2 01 5)\nZe ro -v al en t Fe\n50 –1 00\nIro n ox id e\nEi se ni a fe tid a\n10 0– 10 00\nm g kg\n1 7– 28\nd so il\nG ro w th\nin hi bi tio n Re sp ira tio n de cl in e H ab ita t av oi da nc e Sk in de ge ne ra tio\nn w ith\nRO S pr od\nuc tio\nn\nLi an g et\nal .( 20 17 )\nCe O 2\n4 D ex tr an\n(0 ), di et hy la m in oe th yl -

This endocytosis pathway may cause the intracellular toxicity due to the high content of labile metal ions through a process called “Trojan horse” effect. Other endocytosis pathways including caveolae/lipid raft-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis did not transport the ENPs for lysosomal degradation, but inside cell, particles remain in nano-form (Tangaa et al., 2016). Ions released as a result of ENPs dissolution are internalized in the cell through transporter proteins or ion channels. For instance, Na ion channels are involved in the uptake of ionic Ag in freshwater fish rainbow trout (Bury & Wood, 1999). As ENPs have the tendency to bind with protein (protein-corona) and aggregate in saline solution so these are not excreted out of an organism’s body like regular contaminants via excretory organs (Lin et al., 2010). So, once ENPs has entered the cell, these localized in different subcellular compartments and alter the cytophysiology. Primary ENPs toxicity induction modes include but not limited to the release of ions with particles dissolution, oxidative stress, cellular protein injury, membrane and DNA damage (Das et al., 2018; Sonane et al., 2017; Zhao, He, Lu, & Duo, 2017). In the heterogonous system, ENPs physico-chemical characteristics such as shape, size, charge, crystalline phase, coating materials could influence their bioactivity and toxicity. Oral exposure of TiO2 ENPs to mice caused the oxidative stress, chromosomal aberrations and adversely affected the liver function with increasing exposure concentration from 50 to 500mg kg 1 (Ali et al., 2019). For cellular trafficking particles have to pass through the cell membrane pores, thus the ENPs transport is directly dependent on particle size. Smaller size (10 nm) CuO ENPs induces more toxicity to sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) embryos with low EC50/96 h (450 ppb) comparative to the larger size particles (50 nm) (EC50 ¼ 5395 ppb). This is might be\nFigure 4. Cellular uptake of ENPs through the cell membrane and mechanisms of cell damage. Adapted from Qu et al. (2013) and Sukhanova et al. (2018).\ndue to the higher dissolution of small size embryo internalized particles (Torres-Duarte et al., 2016). Ag ENPs exposure to terrestrial isopods (Porcellio scaber) in concentration range of 0.28 to 36mg mL 1 through feeding hazelnut leaves for 14 days caused changes in proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates (Novak et al., 2019). Particles morphology also mediates the nano-toxicity to the organisms. Exposure of rod-shaped Fe2O3 ENPs in concentration range of 25–100 lg mL\n1 effectively accumulate in the cell line of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and produces more cytotoxicity with greater oxidative and membrane damage than sphere shape particles (Cardillo et al., 2016). When fibroblast of Tursiops truncates exposed to different concentrations (20, 50, 100, 150 lg mL 1) of anatase and rutile TiO2 ENPs, rutile form substantially break DNA strand and caused the genotoxic effect with oxidative stress (Frenzilli et al., 2014). Positively charged CeO2 ENPs is more toxic and bio-accumulated to a greater degree than negative or neutral particles due to membranes surface negative potential (Collin, Oostveen, Tsyusko, & Unrine, 2014). Moreover, after internalization in cell positively charged ENPs has the affinity to bind with proteins, vitamins or other ion and localized in lysosome which trigger CeO2 (þ) oxidase activity due to acidic microenvironment (Collin et al., 2014). Dietary exposure of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) functionalized positively charged Au ENPs (4 nm) at 1–50lg L 1 concentration to planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna induces cellular stress through upregulation of glutathione S-transferase (GST), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and metallothionein1 (MT1) genes (Dominguez et al., 2015). In terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber, the dietary exposure of 2000, or 5000mg g 1 of CeO2 ENPs for 14 days decreased the feeding rate and increased the lipid peroxidation level (Malev et al., 2017)."

In photo-dissolution process residual photogenerated holes on ZnO surfaces could attack the Zn-O bond and disassociate Zn2þ from ZnO surface.

TiO2 ENPs exposure to Zebrafish (Danio rerio) during the developmental stage at an environmentally relevant concentration (1 ng mL 1) for a period of 23 days and illumination with artificial light in the range of solar spectrum caused impaired growth, malformations, slow metamorphosis, and genotoxic effects. The oxidative damage with irradiation is confirmed with the elevated level of 8-hydroxy20-deoxyguanosine DNA adducts (Bar-Ilan et al., 2013). Environmental conditions, like natural organic matter (NOM), ionic strength (IS), pH, and background electrolyte composition, temperature, light, contact time between ENPs and natural colloids, synergistic/antagonistic interaction between NPs influences nano-toxicity of ENPs (Peng, Zhang, et al., 2017). Meanwhile, in natural waters there are much higher concentrations of suspended sediments (e.g., clay particles) that heteroaggregate rapidly with the ENPs, removing them from the water column fairly rapidly. Furthermore, a number of organic and inorganic contaminants are distributed in the natural environment. ENPs act as a carrier to transport these environmental contaminants into the cells of living organisms due to their tremendous sorption capacity. These ENPs surface adsorb contaminants have synergistic or antagonistic effects on the toxicity of ENPs to different organisms depending on the contaminant surface charge and ENPs zeta potential (Deng, Lin, et al., 2017). The co-exposure of arsenic (50 lg L 1) with TiO2 ENPs (1mg L\n1) to estuarine polychaete Laeonereis acuta at nominal concentration increased the ROS level and glutathione reductase (GR) activity, reduce the antioxidant capacity as well as vandalized the organism lipid and DNA damage (Nunes et al., 2017). Moreover, the synergistic effect of co-exposure influences the metabolization capacity of estuarine polychaete and accumulates the moderately toxic dimethylated arsenic forms in the organism. In blue mussel Mytilus edulis the simultaneous absorption of TiO2 ENPs with carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) from seawater induced the chromosomal aberration and oxidative damage. TiO2 ENPs may act as an activator and break-down the (B[a]P) into more reactive products inside the cells (Farkas et al., 2015). Potentially toxic elements\n(PTEs) Cd and Zn assimilated in the freshwater zooplankton Daphnia magna and the levels of metallothioneins (MTs) and ROS are affected due to the strong binding of ionic metals with the TiO2 ENPs in the gut (Tan & Wang, 2014). In the heterogeneous environment ENPs ecotoxicity monitoring is a challenging task. In aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem certain multicellular organisms are serving as bio-indicators to monitor the environmental toxicology of ENPs. Earthworms (Eisenia Andrei, Eisenia fetida) are ecologically relevant receptors and their primary response in ENPs contaminated soil is habitat avoidance which minimizes the deleterious effects on their survival, growth, cocoon production and viability (Liang et al., 2017; McShane, Sarrazin, Whalen, Hendershot, & Sunahara, 2012). Caenorhabditis elegans is a soil-dwelling nematode used as a model organism to test the ENPs toxicity and bioaccumulation. Caenorhabditis elegans responds to the lethal effects of TiO2, SiO2, and ZnO ENPs at environmentally relevant concentrations by producing ROS and changing locomotion behavior, growth and reproduction (Wu et al., 2013). Multiple toxicity biomarkers such as behavioral impairment (burrowing kinetics, feeding rate, swimming behavior) and modification in biochemical response including lysozyme synthesis, oxyradical, and nitric oxide (NO.) production, and inflammatory response with the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) were detected in zebrafish Danio rerio, polychaete Hediste diversicolor and bivalves mollusks upon ENPs intracellular localization (Buffet et al., 2011; Canesi et al., 2010; Skjolding et al., 2017). These studies indicate the ENPs potential ecological risks toward the organism energy acquisition, viability, growth, development, and reproduction, which in turn influence the ecological relationship and the sustainability of an ecosystem."

      "heading" : "4.3. ENPs trophic level transfer and impacts on mammals",
      "text" : "Moreover, after intact ENPs tissue internalization in lower trophic level organisms, body surfaces adsorption, bio-accumulation in the gut lumen and subsequent transfer of ENPs from prey to predator is a novel scenario (Tangaa et al., 2016). Bio-accumulation and bio-magnification of ENPs in food chain members through trophic level transfer is possible in addition to direct exposure (Luo et al., 2016). Thus, its utmost important to determine nano-toxicity in organisms lying at different levels of the food web. In hornworms, three different size Au ENPs were transferred with food through the consumption of ENPs contaminated tobacco leaves. The biomagnification process was found to be dependent on the particles zeta potential rather than particles size (Judy, Unrine, & Bertsch, 2011). Daphnia magna is a well-known primary consumer for food chain eco-\ntoxicity study in aquatic ecosystem and natural prey of many other organisms. Au ENPs bio-accumulated in Daphnia magna when fed with contaminated algae (Lee et al., 2015). ENPs transferred from Daphnia magna to zebrafish (Danio rerio) and 10 folds more body burden was recorded upon dietary uptake in comparison of water born exposure (Skjolding, WintherNielsen, & Baun, 2014). Recently, Dong, Xia, Yang, Lin, and Mao (2018) has confirmed the trophic level transfer of 14C-labeled graphene from bacteria (Escherichia coli) to vertebrate (Danio rerio) in aquatic food chain via protozoa (Tetrahymena thermophile) and zooplankton (Daphnia magna). Through the trophic level transfer of ENPs, different sub-lethal effects including changes in growth and development, lifespan reduction and impaired reproduction have been reported (Luo et al., 2016; Tangaa et al., 2016). Bio-magnification through the food chain is considered to be dependent on both abiotic (ENPs properties, exposure condition of prey) and biotic factors (physiology of organisms, predator-prey relationship, food web structure, analyzed organ) (Judy et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2016). Mammals including human-beings are the ultimate recipient of the ENPs distributed in different compartments of the environment either through dermal absorption, inhalation or ingestion with the consumption of contaminated food. A summary of different carbon-based, metal and metal oxide ENPs toxicological effects to mammals is presented in Table 4. Intravenous administration of ultra-small superparamagnetic-Fe3O4 (0.4, 2 and 10lg kg 1) and diesel exhaust (400 lg kg 1) ENPs to mice increased the levels of oxidative stress-related biomarkers (lipid peroxidation, ROS, SOD) and induced DNA damage (Nemmar et al., 2015). The author speculated that small size particles specifically responsible for biological response due to their deep cellular penetration capacity. When mice were exposed to ultrafine Cu (15.7 nm) atmosphere containing 3.5mg m 3 Cu ENPs, these ENPs were redistributed in the animal body. These ENPs caused pulmonary inflammation with increased activity of neutrophils and different cytokines/chemokines. Moreover, the expression levels of several immune responsive genes including Th1/Th2 were also altered in the spleen of Cu ENPs treated mice as compared to the control (Adamcakova-Dodd, Monick, Powers, Gibson-Corley, & Thorne, 2015). Co-exposure of ENPs can either have additive or antagonistic effects on the organisms. Tsugita, Morimoto, and Nakayama (2017) have observed the drastic lung inflammation in C57BL/6 N female mice with caspase-1 inflammasome activation and secretion of interleukin-1b (IL-1b) cytokine under the synergistic influence of widely used TiO2 and SiO2 ENPs. In order to study the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of ENPs, Åkerlund et al. (2018) have treated the human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBECL) and mouse embryonic stem cell line (MECL) with Ni ENPs, NiO and soluble Ni chloride.

NiO ENPs mediated mutation and DNA damage through oxidative stress and protein unfolding (Åkerlund et al., 2018). Moreover, Al2O3 ENPs triggered up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle retardation at the G2/ S stage and ultimately cell death in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) (Li, Zhang, et al., 2016). Omics approach also detected the perturbations in normal cellular functioning in the response to alumina ENPs (Li, Zhang, et al., 2016). Carbon black ENPs induced neurotoxicity in the mice offsprings through the over-expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 after maternal exposure to ENPs in dose-dependent manner (Onoda, Takeda, & Umezawa, 2017)."

      "heading" : "5. Removal and degradation strategies of ENPs in the environment",
      "text" : "Nanotechnology-based consumer products are the inescapable part of everyday life in this millennium. In addition to providing enormous benefits, these nano-enabled products generated a new category of waste called nano-waste which is toxic to the humans and other organisms in the environment. Conventional methods of waste handling and treatment are not sufficient for the disposal of nano-wastes (Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska et al., 2009). For the purpose of efficient nano-waste handling, the categorization of nano-waste as a function of constituent material toxicity and exposure potency provide several benefits including effective waste treatment and disposal to mitigate the ENPs eco-toxicity hazardous (Bakiu, 2018). Different physical, chemical, and biological methods are used for the treatment of waste containing ENPs. However, no single technique can remove emerging nano-scale environmental pollutants from the waste streams with 100% efficiency. Moreover, the bio-solid produced after nano-waste treatment is either applied directly to agricultural fields as fertilizers or deposited in landfills in the form of slag/fly ash after incineration of solid waste. For instance, only in the USA and China 190,000 metric tons per annum of ten major nano-materials embedded in personal care products end up in landfills (Keller, Vosti, Wang, & Lazareva, 2014). Life cycle analysis of Ag and TiO2 contaminated municipal solid waste (MSW) application to the agricultural soil have indicated the toxic impact of these ENPs to the human health and terrestrial ecosystem (Stamou & Antizar-Ladislao, 2016). Although the incinerated solid waste products are considered stable, however weathering process in landfills containing incineration residues can release the ENPs counterpart fractions in the leachate that could pose a threat of groundwater contamination and unknown consequences on other environmental compartments (Mitrano, Mehrabi, Dasilva, & Nowack, 2017). Thus, it is crucial to closely monitor and regulate the ENPs\nconcentration in the treated effluents, solid waste and landfills leachate for ecosystem safety."

      "heading" : "5.1. Role of natural clays in removal of ENPs",
      "text" : "In the natural environment variety of clay minerals presence play an important role in the removal of contaminants (Ismadji, Soetaredjo, & Ayucitra, 2015). Clay minerals have variable surface charge and geometric dimensions. The most common clay minerals are kaolinite, montmorillonite, vermiculite, mica and etc. Kaolinite is 1:1 type clay consisting of silica tetrahedral sheets connected via apical oxygen atoms to aluminum dioctahedral sheets. Montmorillonite is 2:1 type clay with sheet-like structure, in which two layers of Si-tetrahedra sandwich one layer of Al-octahedra (Liu et al., 2017). These clay minerals have tendency to adsorb various pollutants and other materials due to high cation exchange capacity (CEC), more specific surface area and swelling nature (Gupta, Dhawan, & Shanker, 2016). The interaction of clay minerals with ENPs largely determine their fate in the environment through heteroaggregation, and sedimentation. Clay particles can also coagulate the ENPs in aqueous environments and thus play role in the removal of nano-contaminants. Kaolin clay destabilizes the Ag and TiO2 ENPs in the aqueous system and promoted the sedimentation of these ENPs through heteroaggregation process (Wang et al., 2015). Electrostatic interaction of CeO2 ENPs with kaolinite change the distribution of surface charge density from homogenous to heterogeneous charged plane (Guo, Jiang, Serem, Sharma, & Ma, 2019). Zhang group (Zhang, Petersen, et al., 2012) has found that soil clay minerals (kaolinite, smectite and shale) removed the MWCNTs from the aqueous media through sorption on clay surface followed by settling of aggregated CNTs. The affinity of clay particles interaction with ENPs depends on the ENPs surface characteristics, clay/ENPs concentration ratio and solution chemistry (pH, ionic strength, NOM), in addition of type of clay mineral particles (Labille, Harns, Bottero, & Brant, 2015). Moreover, aggregation process reduces the surface area to volume thus effects the reactivity and toxicity of ENPs. The heteroaggregation of TiO2 ENPs with montmorillonite clay particles drastically reduces the toxic effect of ENPs on development of zebrafish embryos (Kansara, Kumar, & Karakoti, 2020). The hydrogen-bonding and Lewis acid-base interactions induced the aggregation of carbon dots (CDs) with soil minerals in addition to van der Waals and electrical double-layer forces and reduce the bioavailability of these carbon based ENMs (Liu et al., 2017). The presence of montmorillonite in the CuO ENPs exposure medium play a protective role in the development of zebrafish embryo by reducing the bioavailability of\nENPs (Kansara, Paruthi, Misra, Karakoti, & Kumar, 2019). Montmorillonite clay particles modulates the bioavailability and toxicity of Ag and ZnO ENPs to zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Tetrahymena pyriformis, respectively (Gupta et al., 2017, 2016). The low cost, nonhazardous, and ubiquitous presence in nature make clay minerals the most environmentally relevant sorbent for the water treatment technology. Thus, these clay particles are the potential candidate for the decontamination of engineered nanomaterials in the environment."

      "heading" : "5.2. Biogenic synthesis and role of biochar in nano-pollutants waste handling",
      "text" : "Bio-genic synthesis of environment-friendly nano-materials using the principles of green chemistry has emerged a sustainable approach in a recent couple of years. Nano-materials bio-genic synthesis involved one step reduction and stabilization through biological routes relying on microbes, algae, plants or their derived products (biomolecules) using the principles of nano-bio-technology (Saratale et al., 2018). Green synthesis approach can substantially reduce the use of toxic chemicals and solvents used in the conventional energy-intensive physical and chemical fabrication processes (Singh et al., 2018). As, according to the estimates of Woodrow Wilson Center considerable amount of waste is sent to landfill sites during the entire life cycle of ENPs containing products (Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska et al., 2009). Thus, in order to overcome the emission of toxic contaminants into the natural environment and reduce human health hazards green synthesis/biogenic synthesis of ENMs with distinct properties (morphology, size, and bioactivity) is a reliable, eco-friendly and sustainable approach for a wide range of nano-materials. Biochar is a carbon-rich solid product, produced at a relatively low temperature (300–700 C) from diverse waste biomass materials during pyrolysis process and contain a variety of functional groups (Abbas et al., 2018; Liu, Liu, Yousaf, & Abbas, 2018). It can be used effectively for the remediation of environmental contaminants (Ahmad et al., 2014; Yousaf, Liu, Abbas, Ullah, et al., 2018). Recently, biochar has been applied successfully in the soil system to immobilize different ENPs by surface interaction. It reduced the bioavailability, uptake, and accumulation of CeO2, and Ag ENPs to soil fauna Oligochaeta (Enchytraeus albidus) and earthworm (Eisenia fetida) (Nyoka, Kanyile, Bredenhand, Prinsloo, & Voua Otomo, 2018; Servin et al., 2018). The possible mechanism of ENPs adsorption on biochar surface is shown in Figure 5. It has also alleviated the phyto-toxic effects of ENPs to different food crops (Abbas et al., 2020; Sima, Shen, Fang, Yu, & Jiang, 2017). In our recent study, bamboo waste derived\nbiochar substantially reduced the uptake and bioaccumulation of Ag ENPs in the rice plants (Abbas et al., 2019). Similarly, Rice husk (RH) derived biochar efficiently ameliorated the bio-toxicity of CuO ENPs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants by immobilizing the ENPs with space shield effect and surface adsorption of released Cu2þ ions (Sima et al., 2017). Biochar surface functionalities such as carboxyl (-COOH), hydroxyl (-OH) and aromatic groups are responsible for overcoming repulsive forces between ENPs and biochar (Abbas et al., 2020). In our recent study, we have found that biochar reduced the bioaccumulation of CeO2 ENPs in wheat plants through its surface functionalities mainly carboxylate and hydroxyl functional groups (Abbas et al., 2020). Hydrogen bonding in addition of charge transfer and van der Waals interaction likely the predominant driving forces involved in the irreversible heteroaggregation of ENP contaminants with biochar (Uchimiya, Pignatello, White, Hu, & Ferreira, 2017). The stable complex formation capability of biochar can immobilize and retain remarkably high (>22mg g 1) concentration of Au ENPs on its surface (Uchimiya et al., 2017). Other mechanisms of nano-pollutants bioavailability reduction through biochar addition involved the alternation in the pH of exposure medium which reduced the dissolution process of ENPs (Abbas et al., 2019). Thus, from the above studies, it is clear that biochar can be used as an effective in situ remedial agent in the nano-waste contaminated soil to prevent the food chain accumulation and dietary human exposure of ENPs.\nFigure 5. Mechanism of ENPs interaction and adsorption on biochar surface."

      "heading" : "5.3. Bioremediation approach for sustainable environment",
      "text" : "Bioremediation is regarded a safe and economical method for the removal of contaminants from the environment utilizing microbes and plants based system (Abhilash, Powell, Singh, & Singh, 2012). Microbes degrade the ENPs in the environment especially carbon-based nano-materials with the secretion of extracellular enzymes and EPS (Schreiner et al., 2009; Zhang, Chen, & Alvarez, 2014). Biodegradation of the ENPs surface coating or core component is possible. This is particularly relevant for the carbonbased ENMs including CNTs and fullerene. For instance, white-rot basidiomycete fungi can enzymatically degrade the hydroxylated fullerol (C60 (OH)19-27) by the oxidation process and mineralized it to CO2 in 32weeks (Schreiner et al., 2009). In a recent study, Zhang and coworkers (Zhang et al., 2014) have observed the degradation of close cage SWCNT structure either by the direct Mn3þ oxidation process or through the malonate mediated pathway with a naturally occurring extracellular enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP). Horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) is another phyto-enzyme existing in the rhizospheric zone of horseradish has been successfully applied for the biological degradation of carboxylated and nitrogen-doped MWCNTs (Zhao, Allen, & Star, 2011). Heme-active HRP interacts with nanotubes oxygen functional defective sites by hydrophilic interaction and promoted the oxidative layer by layer degradation of nanotubes due to their multilayer graphitic structure. During the degradation process of carbon-based nanomaterials, the length and diameter of materials reduced, carboxyl groups are added, and CO2 is produced (Schreiner et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014). More recently, Mukherjee et al. (Mukherjee et al., 2018) has investigated the bio-degradation of graphene oxide (GO) with neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO), a peroxidase enzyme generated in humans, and resulting graphene degraded product is non-cytotoxic for human lungs. These findings elucidate the carbon-based materials degradation potential of various enzymes secreted by different organisms and thereby diminishing the environmental hazards to diverse ecologicalcommunities. For all types of ENPs, organic surface coating bio-degradation is relevant, as these surface coatings are applied to improve the ENPs stability for their various applications. A large number of organic polymers are currently used as a matrix material for the surface coating of ENPs to obtain the desired properties (Al-Kattan et al., 2014; Rhiem et al., 2016; Vorbau, Hillemann, & Stintz, 2009). Microbial mediated degradation processes enhance the biodegradability of these polymer coatings (Bai, Wang, Abuduaini, Zhu, & Zhao, 2016; Peixoto, Silva, & Kr€uger, 2017). ENPs surface coating biological degradation induces aggregation and deposition\nprocess. In a case study, polyethylene oxide (PEO) ENPs surface coating has been degraded by bacteria that stabilize the ENPs (Kirschling et al., 2011). Moreover, plant-microbe interaction in the rhizosphere zone (phytostimulation or rhizo-degradation) plays an important role in the plantbased (phyto-remediation) remediation system by promoting plant growth, affecting pollutants bioavailability and uptake as well as degradation, sequestration, and bio-transformation process of the ENPs (Abhilash et al., 2012). Plant-based bio-remediation approach (phyto-remediation/phytoextraction/phyto-accumulation) involved the cultivation of green plants to remove the ENPs environmental pollutants present in water, air, or soil and accumulate them in different tissues. Several terrestrial and wetland plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, duckweed species, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), mustard (Brassica juncea), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), water hyacinth (Eichhronia crassipes), and among others bio-accumulate metallic ENPs with either low or no negative effects on their growth and development (Gomes, da, Hauser-Davis, de Souza, & Vit oria, 2016; Rai et al., 2018). Aquatic plant duckweed species Landoltia punctate and Lemna minor can effectively bio-accumulated at least 2 fold higher concentration of Ag and Al than the environmental concentrations in both intact nano and dissolved ionic forms (Juhel et al., 2011; Stegemeier, Colman, Schwab, Wiesner, & Lowry, 2017). In natural environment, very stable ENPs such as CeO2 and TiO2 were phyto-extracted with wetland (Rumex crispus L. and Elodea canadensis) and desert Mesquite plants (Hernandez-Viezcas, Castillo-Michel, Peralta-Videa, & GardeaTorresdey, 2016; Jacob, Borchardt, Navaratnam, Otte, & Bezbaruah, 2013). Even hyper-accumulator Prosopis juliflora plant had uptake as much as 4504lg g 1 of CeO2 through roots and translocated them into aerial tissues (Hernandez-Viezcas et al., 2016). Furthermore, ENPs present in atmospheric particulate matter enter into plants through aerial portions especially leaves providing another option of phyto-remediation for the removal of these pollutants from the atmospheric environment (Gomes et al., 2016). The plants defense mechanism in response of ENPs accumulation has already been described in the section 3.3. Once contaminants are removed from the environment through phytoremediation process using hyper-accumulator plants, a lot of contaminated biomass is produced which needs to be handled in accordance with regulatory guidelines of USEPA to avoid the potential ecological risks (US-EPA, 2000). Existing conventional disposal methods of hyper-accumulated plants such as combustion, composting, incineration and landfilling, introduces secondary pollutants in the environmental compartments (air, soil and water bodies) (Rai et al., 2018). Conceptual model though cradle-to-cradle\nsystem for handling of nano-waste is presented in Figure 6. Thus it is crucial to find sustainable alternative ways for the disposal of these pollutant hyper-accumulated plants. In this regard, the coupling of phytoremediation with bioenergy generation is a clean, economical and environment friendly option for the management of the contaminants (metallic-nano-size materials) loaded plants (Yousaf, Liu, Abbas, Ali, et al., 2018). Thermochemical conversion of metal loaded waste biomass is a promising technique to obtain multifunctional value-added products in addition to renewable and carbon-neutral energy. For the recovery of bioenergy and metal elements from the metal contaminated paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) biomass, adsorption pyrolysis is an efficient technology (Han et al., 2018). Precious metals such as Au, Pd have also been recovered through phyto-extraction followed by thermal treatment of biomass waste. Pyrolysis treatment of the ENPs containing willows and miscanthus biomass can improve the catalytic activity of these materials comparable to the commercially available catalyst (Harumain et al., 2017). Moreover, the metal loaded plants can also be a natural source of facile metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and find applications in energy storage devices (Salunkhe, Kaneti, & Yamauchi, 2017). Bioethanol a potential candidate to replace fossil fuels can be produced through green technology from the metal hyper-accumulator sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plant biomass after enzymatic saccharification process (Dhiman et al., 2017).\nFigure 6. Conceptual model though cradle-to-cradle system.\nGasification of potentially toxic metallic elements (PTMEs) Cd, Pb and Zn hyper-accumulator Sedum alfredii has indicated its potential to generate energy from biomass waste and metal stabilized biochars (Cui et al., 2018). These PTME stabilized solid biochar can be effectively reutilized for the adsorption of organic pollutants from the environmental waste streams. For instance, Gong et al. (2018) has performed the pyrolysis of Ramie (Boehmeria nivea) after phytoremediation of PTMEs contaminated sediments and obtained metal stabilized biochar adsorbed as much as 259.27mg g 1 of methylene blue from the wastewater."

      "text" : "Besides, above-mentioned strategies for the management of nano-wastes, legislative measures should be adopted to control widespread use and disposal of ENPs into the environment. In most of the countries, the current legislative framework is not sufficient to deal with the ENMs labeled products potential ecological risks during the life cycle of these products from raw material manufacturing to disposal phase (Patil, Shedbalkar, Truskewycz, Chopade, & Ball, 2016). Recently US-EPA urged to obtain more detail information about production volume, chemical density, production method, processing, possible use, environmental input and safety data under information gathering rule “toxic substances control act” from the manufacturer prior to nano-enabled products synthesis (Younis et al., 2018). Other institutions such as Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), International Waste Working Group (IWWG) on ENMs waste and European Union (EU) in collaboration with European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) are also actively involved to regularize and update the eco-toxicity test guidelines for nano-materials to prevent their environmental damage. A multifaceted approach should be adopted including advanced research, public awareness, integrated legislation, and technical assistance in periodical evaluation of nano-enabled products to obtain the maximum desirable benefits and keep the detrimental outcomes below the threshold level with the use of these products (Patil et al., 2016; Younis et al., 2018)."

      "heading" : "6. Summary and future outlook",
      "text" : "During the last couple of years, advancement in nanotechnology has facilitated the incorporation of novel ENPs in almost every commercial product to obtain socioeconomic benefits. Thus, the ever-increasing use of nanoenabled products releasing substantial quantities of ENPs during product lifecycle into the different compartments of the environment. ENPs\nexposure to different organisms have deleterious effects on the growth and survival. Photoactive ENPs (ZnO and TiO2) upon exposure to light are toxic to organisms even at <1mg L 1 concentration. Degradation process of CdS QDs releases Cd which is toxic to sediment dwelling organisms at 0.01mg of Cd L 1. Oxidative stress through excessive production of ROS is the primary mechanism of nano-toxicity in microbes and multicellular organisms including mammals (humans). In most cases but not always ENPs interaction with plants had low concentration stimulatory and high concentration inhibitory impacts. ENPs caused phyto-toxicity at physiological and morphological levels by modifying various biochemical pathways. Plants also respond to ENPs through up and down-regulation of several genes involved in different cellular functioning. Conclusively, the toxicity of ENPs to various organism depends on the exposure concentration, method of exposure, organism growth stage and habitat as well as environmental conditions. The management of nano-waste is utmost important as according to global estimates up-to 90% of the ENPs contained in nano-products ultimately end up in landfills or sewage sludge. In most of the countries especially in developing ones, the dumping of nanowaste at open landfill sits or application to agricultural lands makes the scenario worse. Thus, it is crucial to adopt certain sustainable approaches for the synthesis of nano-enables products and eco-friendly handling of nano-waste. Phytoremediation of nano-waste contaminated sites followed by thermochemical conversion of plants biomass into various usable products such as renewable energy source and stabilized green synthesis material for various potential applications is a good option. In order to avoid the irreversible consequences of ENPs on the ecosystem functioning and human health, future studies should address the following challenges.\n1. There is a strong need to develop standard protocols to test the nanoecotoxicity at environmentally relevant concentration of ENPs with chronic exposure. As most of the nano-toxicity studies are performed at much higher concentration than the ENPs predicted environment concentration without out considering their dynamic transformation processes and interaction with other components of the ecosystem. 2. In addition to conventional toxicity biomarkers commonly used for other contaminants, omics-based techniques such as genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics should be applied to understand the molecular basis of nano-toxicology. 3. Studies about the tropical transfer of ENPs and bio-magnification through the consumption of contaminated food in the aquatic and terrestrial food web are areas of concern.\n4. Explore the co-exposure behavior of ENPs with other contaminants in the environmental matrices as these caused “Trojan horse” effect by accelerating ENPs bioaccumulation through alteration in bioavailability and uptake to different organisms. 5. For a better understanding of nano-phytotoxicity, the relationship between genes expression and signaling transduction pathways of ROS in the response of ENPs should be studied in addition to potential trans-generational effects. Moreover, plants enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidant defense system to cope with the nano-toxicity need consideration. 6. Green synthesis of ENPs incorporated products according to the outlines of US-EPA is a promising field for researchers to synthesis environmental benign materials. 7. Development of safety paradigm and legislative framework for the efficient management of nano-waste particularly newly developed nanoenabled products for environment health safety (EHS). 8. Seek feasible and environmentally safe methods to recycle and deactivate the ENPs in nano-waste. For this purpose, efficient bioremediation of nano-waste contaminated sites and enhanced bioaccumulation of ENPs, transgenic organisms should be explored to successfully integrate the bio-remediation with renewable energy generation and nanowaste recycling.\nIn conclusion, experts from all relevant fields should collaborate to develop eco-friendly sustainable nanotechnology-based products to obtain maximal benefits with minimal ecological hazards."

This review addresses the recent state of knowledge regarding the ENPs ecotoxicity to various organisms lying at different trophic levels. Studies show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated oxidative stress is the primary mechanism of nano-toxicity, either through physical damage by direct contact or release of toxic ions after ENPs dissolution process. Moreover, ENPs uptake, transformation and toxicity on physiomorphological, biochemical and molecular levels in primary producers of terrestrial environment (plants) were also reviewed. Additionally, the intrinsic detoxification mechanism in plants in response to ENPs accumulation was also examined. In the end different sustainable approaches such as biogenic synthesis, clay minerals role, biochar application, bioremediation, and legislative measures are proposed for effective handling and treatment of nano-wastes to get the maximum benefits of nanotechnology with minimum negative outcomes.",
