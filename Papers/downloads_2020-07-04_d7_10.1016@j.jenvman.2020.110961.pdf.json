The developed ZnONPs is characterized by UV–Vis. Spectrophotometry and fluorimetry, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, TEM and BET. Interestingly, pomegranate seeds molasses within a viable content of bio-capping molecules reveal a defective nanoporous ZnO NPs of smaller particle size, greater pore size/volume, and higher surface area compared to the bulky non-biogenic ZnONPs. Moreover, the biosynthesized defective ZnONPs showed narrowed band gap and higher absorption of visible photons that breed higher density of hydroxyl radicals (�OH) under Solar-illumination. Even further, the bulk ZnO and the biosynthesized ZnO photocatalysts were examined in photodegrading flumequine (FL) antibiotic. The bulk ZnO gives 41.46% photodegradation efficiency compared to 97.6% for the biosynthesized ZnO. In highly acidic or highly alkaline media, FL photodegradability is greatly retarded. Scavenging experiment infers considerable contribution of holes over electrons in photodegradation reaction. The biosynthesized ZnO shows high durability in FL photodegradation after four reusing cycles. These promising findings highlight new insights for biogenic synthesis of tuned size/controlled morphology semiconductor NPs relevant to environmental remediation applications."

      "text" : "Due to continuous exploration of new characteristics within promising diverse applications, nanotechnology has been capturing more and more attention, especially in dealing with semiconductor materials for several decades. High-surface-to-volume semiconductor nanoparticles and other exceptional physicochemical characteristics make them a leading contender in materials that have been renovated.\nZinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were described among the various semiconductors as functionally promising and versatile inorganic materials with unparalleled optical and electrical properties that can be adjusted by modifying the size and morphology (Ma et al., 2019). Accordingly, ZnO displays a wide variety of appealing applications in\nthe optoelectronics, piezoelectrical devices, transparent electronics, chemical sensors (Saito et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018), environmental protection, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, agricultural and food industries (Espitia et al., 2012). In addition, ZnO NPs demonstrated tremendous efficacy in biological and medical areas such as biological labeling, bio-sensing, gene delivery, drug delivery, nanomedicine and cosmetic sectors owing to their anti-microbial, anti-diabetic and wound healing capabilities (Dastjerdi and Montazer, 2010; Radzimska and Jesionowski, 2014; Mishra et al., 2017; Moezzi et al., 2012). ZnO nanoparticles have a wurtzite structure and belong to the family of semiconductors category II-IV, which has a covalence between ionic and covalent semiconductors (Ngoepe et al., 2018). Moreover, advanced oxidation process (AOPs) and the field of photocatalysis utilize ZnO to\n* Corresponding author. Chemistry Department, College of Science, Jouf University, Sakaka, P.O.

Recently, wide utilization of antibiotics to confront infectious diseases and maintain the body health for human, fauna and flora (Kummerer, 2009) could be accompanied by abusing or inconvenient disposal. The antimicrobial agent, flumequine (FL), is one of the fluoroquinolone antiobiotics (Fig. 1) frequently detected within 6.9 μg/g in soil and 2.5–50 ng/L in aquatic media (Rodrigues-Silva et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2015a, 2015b). Unfortunately, the presence of trace amounts of FL in environment may result in resistive microbes and distressed organisms. Therefore, its presence in the aquatic life exhibits serious environmental issues that pave the way to an inevitable need for its save and efficient removal.\nTo attain highly effaceable ZnO-photocatalyzed processes, it is important to devote research for morphology evolution to material characteristics. Thereby, tremendous attempts have been produced with distinct morphologies in ZnO’s preparation techniques. Methods employing physical, chemical and green synthetic routes have been successfully presented. In recent years, researchers are remarkably interested in achieving advancement in the green technicalities for synthesizing semiconductor nanoparticles. This is due to advantages of safety, rapidity, positive economic and eco-friendly large scale productivity as compared with physical and chemical approaches Joseph and Mathew (2015); Kaushal et al. (2016). In such fascinating area of green biosynthesis of nanoparticles, microorganisms, enzymes, alga and plant extracts are used. The plant extracts contain various types of phenolic and flavonoid compounds that help in nanoparticles formation (Khan et al., 2016; Tahir et al., 2016). For example, from the extracts of various plants (Jafarirad et al., 2016; Ngoepe et al., 2018; Haritha et al., 2016; Kalaiselvi et al., 2015; Essawy, 2018; Kumar et al., 2015; Elango et al., 2016), ZnO and other nanomaterials were synthesized.\nIn the field of photocatalysis, ZnO is a wide band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 3.37 eV that unfortunately displays a lower compatibility to utilize solar energy (Essawy et al., 2018). In 2011, in Science, Chen et al. reported on a technique to reduce the band gap of TiO2 semiconductor materials that opened the door for scientists to a new globe (Chen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2017; Essawy et al., 2017). In fabricating solar-responsive ZnO NPs with high performance, factors of porosity and surface oxygen defects are greatly crucial in exploring merits of ZnO in photocatalysis. The porous structure could exhibit higher adsorption potentiality, and the oxygen vacancies act as capture centers for photogenerated electrons. Accordingly, the reassemble of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is prohibited and more electrons reach the surface producing high density of reactive oxidizing species (Khan et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Furthermore, a defect level will be generated plausibly narrowing the band gap and enhances the electrical properties (Xu et al., 2015).\nThe recent bio-inspired green synthetic routes offer a uniquely flexible growth of nanoparticles of controlled shape and size (Narayanan and Sakthivel, 2010; Thakkar et al., 2010; Katata-Seru et al., 2018).\nHerein, the pomegranate seeds extract is presented as biogenic reducing and capping fuel during a novel one pot aqueous solution combustion reaction for the fabrication of a nanoporous defective ZnO nanoparticles. The amount of pomegranate extract added to the reaction course confers an interesting structural features of the prepared ZnO enabling highly efficient harvesting of solar energy. Furthermore, stunning Solar-sensitization for extensive productivity of reactive oxidizing species urgently required for a potent confronting of aquatic toxification by FL. To date, ZnO-photocatalyzed degradation of FL wastewater is markedly delimited in literature. Even further, to the best of our knowledge, the Solar-driven photocatalytic degradation of FL wastewater has not been reported."

Here, the extremely sensitive photoluminescence (PL) labeling of �OH radicals’ productivity was employed using the probe terephthalic acid (TA) (Essawy et al., 2016).

As seen, after 30 min of FL adsorption in dark, a decrease by 2–3% in FL concentration is accomplished for contacting FL with the different catalyst surfaces. Moreover, the degradation kinetics illustrated in Fig. 12B obeys first order and compares the photodegradation of FL in absence of photocatalyst, in presence of bulk ZnO or defective ZnO (4MSCDZnO) as well as commercial ZnO. The results summarized in Table 3 show high photostability of FL towards direct photolysis with a very low photodegradability rate constant, k ¼ 0.0016 min 1. Also, the results address the superior photocatalytic activity of the defective ZnO (4MSCDZnO) with k ¼ 0.0397 min 1 over bulk ZnO with k ¼ 0.0055 min 1 or commercial ZnO giving k of 0.0231 min 1. Accordingly, the biogenic defective ZnO photocatalyst achieves either 7.22 folds or 1.72 folds enhancement in FL degradation over the non-biogenic bulk ZnO or commercial ZnO, respectively. Additionally the decrease of pH at the end of degradation process from the corresponding initial value refers to the acid nature of the degraded products. The surpass of the defective ZnO NPs over the bulk ZnO in the photocatalyzed degradation of FL contaminant as revealed from the aforesaid results have been found harmonious and proven those complemented from BET surface area characterization, Raman spectra, band gap narrowing, inferred charge carrier separation form PL monitoring, to the extensive productivity of �OH oxidizing species. Furthermore, Table 4 demonstrates the surpass of the developed biogenic defective ZnO NPs over others reported in literatures. As seen, the optimized conditions in using the developed biosynthesized ZnO reveals 97.6% of FL photocatalytic degradation with rate constant 0.0397 min 1. This rate constant is found to be superior by � 4 folds when using LaMgO in degrading FL (10 mg) under UV illumination (Vaizogullar, 2018), �5 folds when using ZnO/TiO2/Sepiolite (Vaizogullar, 2017), �1.7 folds when using B/N codoped TiO2 (Zeng et al., 2019), �2.2 folds when using Goethite/hematite/H2O2 (Kamagate et al., 2018), �1.98 folds when using CeO2 (Iqbal et al., 2020). Furthermore, attaining this surpass in FL photocatalytic degradation under Solar-illumination as a renewable, safe and cost effective illumination source added an interesting advantage for the developed biosynthesized ZnO NPs."

      "heading" : "3.10. Influence of pH on the photodegradation process",
      "text" : "A significant influence on the efficacy of photocatalyzed degradation is attributed to the working pH. Changing pH could exhibits various effects on the chemistry of both the target pollutant and the applied photocatalyst due to a subsequent change in their charge as well as the redox potential of the produced reactive species (Shah et al., 2018; Chekuri, and Tirukkovalluri, 2017). For a constant amount of photocatalyst and fixed concentration of FL, the photocatalytic degradation of FL was studied in four working pH values (3.5, 6.6, natural 8.7, and 11). Since the pKa of FL is 6.5 denoted as “HA”, hence the applied acidic medium reveals cationic form (H2Aþ) while the working alkaline one results in the anionic form “A “, meanwhile the examined ZnO defective NPs being a positively charged at the acidic pH 3.5 and negatively charged at the working alkaline pH 11.0. (Feng et al., 2015a,b).\nAs illustrated in Fig. 13A, the decrease in FL absorbance while employing photodegradation reaction in pH 3.5 results in 54.7% removal efficiency of FL. While working at pH 6.6 that is close to the FL pKa reveals FL removal within efficiency 85.6% (Fig. 13B). On the other hand following the photocatalyzed degradation of FL at pH 11.0 reveals FL removal efficiency by 34% (Fig. 13C). In aqueous solution of natural pH 8.7, the maximum photodegradation efficiency of FL was reached and give value of 97.6%. Moreover, the photodegradation kinetics shown in Fig. 13(D and E) compares the degradation rates of FL at the four working pH values (3.5, 6.6, natural 8.7, and 11). Measuring the pH at the end of degradation course reveals the decrease of pH 3.5 to 3.41, pH 6.6 to 6.36, and the pH 11.0 to 10.83. As previously estimated, when conducting the photocatalytic degradation reaction at the aqueous solution of natural slightly alkaline pH 8.7, the maximum rate constant and t1/2 of values 0.0397 min 1 and 17.45 min are obtained. Otherwise, the rate constants obtained at pH 3.5 and 11.0 are greatly decreased to 0.009 and 0.005 min 1, respectively. This remarkable retardation in the degradation rate could be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged FL molecules and the positive surface of the photocatalyst ZnO at the highly acidic pH. Furthermore, at highly alkaline pH, the negative charges carried by FL molecules and ZnO photocatalyst results in an electrostatic repulsion, thereby the least contact of FL antibiotic pollutant and ZnO surface that led to the least photodegradation rate. These aforementioned repulsive electrostatic interactions and their retarding influence on the FL degradation are further confirmed by employing FL photodegradation at pH 6.6 that is close to the FL pKa. At this pH, the electrostatic repulsions are decreased leading to better contact between FL molecules and ZnO catalyst that results in improved rate of FL photodegradation within a rate constant of 0.0239 min 1 (Fig. 13E). Additionally, the extensive amount of OH ions causes possible scavenging of �OH according to Eq. (4) (Sayed et al., 2017).\n�OH þ OH → O� – þ H2O (k ¼ 61.2 � 1010 M 1s 1, at alkaline pH) (4)\nOn contrary, the slight alkaline pH addressed for the aqueous\nA.A.

As displayed in Fig. 15, addition of e– or hþ scavengers to the photodegradation suite noticeably reduce the degradation efficiency from 97.6% to 72.1% and 20.4%, respectively. Otherwise, the declination of degradation efficiency by 77.2% when using hþ scavenger compared to 25.5% in case of e– scavenger infers the strong contribution of holes in photodegradation reaction over the minor role of photoexcited electrons."

      "text" : "Before giving an insight for the photocatalytic mechanism and the influence of illuminating the biogenic synthesized ZnO defective NPs by Solar photons, the empirical Eqs. (6) and (7) was used to assess the edge positions of valence and conduction bands (Balu et al., 2018):\nEVB ¼ X – Eo þ 0.5Eg (6)\nECB ¼ EVB - Eg (7)\nwhere EVB is the valence band energy, X represents the semiconductors’ absolute electronegativity, Eo is the energy of free electrons on basis of hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), Eg is the semiconductor band gap. The EVB and ECB for the biogenic synthesized ZnO defective NPs give an estimates of þ0.285 and 2.785 eV, respectively (Fig. 16). Meanwhile, with the aid of defective sites addressed along the developed biogenic synthesized ZnO NPs, a narrowing in band gab and improved absorption of Solar photons have been arisen.\nBased on the aforementioned analyses, the illustrative scheme in Fig. 16 shows the influence of Solar photons in activating the biogenic synthesized ZnO defective NPs, generating the charge carriers holes (hþ) and electrons (e ). The holes can react with H2O creating the active oxidizing species, �OH. Meanwhile, the excited electrons to the conduction band can diffuse to the crystal defects thereby promoting their separation from holes (Karthik et al., 2018). These electrons can react with the O2 possibly adsorbed in the porous structure of defective ZnO producing the superoxide radical anions (�O2 ). The generated �OH and �O2 oxidizing species act their role in decomposing FL."

The biosynthesized ZnO in comparison\nA.A. Essawy et al.\nJournal of Environmental Management 271 (2020) 110961\nwith the bulky one prepared in absence of the biogenic reagent is of better response and narrowed band gab to absorb visible photons of solar light. Also, the biosynthesized ZnO is characterized by a nanoporous oxygen vacancies defective morphological sites in addition to smaller particle size, greater pore size/volume and higher surface area. These interesting features enables the biosynthesized ZnO NPs to efficiently produce relatively separable photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes). Thereafter produce higher density (�10 times higher) of hydroxyl radicals (�OH), the mostly active oxidative species involved in photodegradation of environmentally hazardous materials. Even further, examining the photocatalytic activity of the developed catalysts in degrading flumequine (FL) antibiotic illustrate the superior activity of the biogenic synthesized ZnO by 7.22 times over the bulk ZnO and 1.72 times greater than using commercial ZnO. Moreover, following the effect of pH on the photocatalytic degradability of FL results in remarkable retardation in the degradation rate at highly acidic or basic medium as attributed to the least contact of FL antibiotic pollutant and ZnO surface because of electrostatic repulsion between FL molecules and photocatalyst surface. Reusability test reflects considerable photostability and steadily photocatalytic performance of the biosynthesized ZnO NPs in degrading FL. Trapping of charge carriers infers the strong contribution of holes in photodegradation reaction over the minor role of photoexcited electrons. Therefore, the aforementioned findings are promising and pave the way to extensively use biogenic synthetic route to produce semiconductor NPs of tuned size and controlled morphology relevant to environmental remediation applications.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nAmr A.

    "abstractText" : "Herein, novel green/facile approach to synthesize spongy defective zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) is presented using for the first time pomegranate seeds molasses as a green capping fuel/reducing mediator during an aqueous solution combustion process. The developed ZnONPs is characterized by UV–Vis. Spectrophotometry and fluorimetry, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, TEM and BET. Interestingly, pomegranate seeds molasses within a viable content of bio-capping molecules reveal a defective nanoporous ZnO NPs of smaller particle size, greater pore size/volume, and higher surface area compared to the bulky non-biogenic ZnONPs. Moreover, the biosynthesized defective ZnONPs showed narrowed band gap and higher absorption of visible photons that breed higher density of hydroxyl radicals (OH) under Solar-illumination. Even further, the bulk ZnO and the biosynthesized ZnO photocatalysts were examined in photodegrading flumequine (FL) antibiotic. The bulk ZnO gives 41.46% photodegradation efficiency compared to 97.6% for the biosynthesized ZnO. In highly acidic or highly alkaline media, FL photodegradability is greatly retarded. Scavenging experiment infers considerable contribution of holes over electrons in photodegradation reaction. The biosynthesized ZnO shows high durability in FL photodegradation after four reusing cycles. These promising findings highlight new insights for biogenic synthesis of tuned size/controlled morphology semiconductor NPs relevant to environmental remediation",
