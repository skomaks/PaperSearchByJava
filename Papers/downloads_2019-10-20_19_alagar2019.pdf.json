Supercapacitors are classified into three types depending on their charge-storage mechanism such as (i) electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC) (ii) pseudo-capacitors, and (iii) hybrid capacitors. In EDLCs, the energy is formed on the electrode/electrolyte interface by electrostatic attraction with accumulation of charges, while in the pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors the energy is exhibited by Faradaic reaction similar to rechargeable battery. EDLC electrode materials such as graphite, carbon, activated carbon, and conducting polymer materials are exhibiting enhanced pseudocapacitance properties when they are synthesized with metal oxides. The pseudocapacitance materials possess high energy density, excellent capacitance retention, fast and reversible redox reaction which are essential for the energy storage applications [4,5]. Therefore, designing of these materials into porous nano-architectured electrode material will improve their physiochemical properties including high electrical conductivity, large surface area, low density and shell permeability. Furthermore, the synthesis of porous/hollow spheres [6–8] cubes [9], polyhedrons [10], bowls [11] and their manipulation into double-layer shells [12,13] and multi-layer shells [14,15] where tried and reported for the various desired applications.\nThe electrochemical performance of the transition metal oxides such as RuO2 [16], Mn2O3 [17], MnO2 [18], Fe3O4, [19] V2O5 [20],CuO [21], and NiO [22] have been examined, showed pseudocapacitor characteristics. Among them, Mn2O3 is a typical p-type semiconductor materials which has several other implicit applications as sensors [23], magnetic storage media [24], Li-ion batteries [25], molecular adsorption [26] and electro-catalysts [27] owing to its higher valence of manganese (2þ, 3þ, 4þ, and 6þ) [25]. Mn2O3 nanomaterial has received much attention in aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors. Furthermore, it is well known that the electrochemical behavior of nanomaterials is influenced by their chemical structure, phase purity, shape and size of the electrode materials. The improved capacitance performance of various porous structures of Mn2O3 synthesized by wet chemical route where reported [7,28–39] with 611 F g 1 theoretical specific capacity and the Mn2O3/Mn2O3 based composites were as used pseudocapacitor in three electrodes [21,39–45] and in two-electrode symmetric/asymmetric systems [41,42,44]. Porous nanofibers of Mn2O3 in 3 M KOH and Mn2O3 coaxial-cable like nanostructures in 6 M KOH electrolyte were characterized and exhibited specific capacitance of 250 F g 1 and 216 F g 1, respectively [46].\nIn order to improve the capacitance, reducing of the path length for the electrons movement and improve the active materials utilization, mesoporous nano/micro sized particles have been investigated. Several literatures have been reported the synthesis of porous structures of Mn2O3 with various routes synthesis. A porous Mn2O3 nanocubes prepared by hydrothermal method and showed a specific capacitance of 191 F g 1 and a capacitance retention of 58.6% in Na2SO4 electrolyte [17]. These porous modifications have been considered as promising characteristics for the high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors owing to their high surface area together with capability of partly alleviating the volume change during the charge-discharge process and enhance the contact area of the electro-active surface with electrolyte. As a result, the material can withstand an enhanced specific current during charge-discharge cycling. Furthermore, the electrode material can tolerate volume expansion and contraction that occurs during charge/discharge processes.\nHence, the present study highlights the significant of the designing and developing nano-architectured porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes for the supercapacitor applications. The template free CO32and SO42- ions self-assembly assisted spheres and cubes of Mn2O3 were nano-architectured by the hydrothermal method. The porosity of the spheres and cubes of Mn2O3 was created through calcinations method to increase the active sites for the increased Faradaic reaction. The electrochemical performance of the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrode were investigated with three electrode system in LiNO3 electrolyte and obtained an excellent specific capacitance of\n345 F g 1 and 321 F g 1 at 0.2 A g 1. For the first time, the electrochemical performance of PVA-LiNO3 solid-state electrolyte was introduced to fabricate with two electrode systems, the synthesized Mn2O3 (positive) and rGO (negative) electrodes exhibited and significantly improved specific capacitance. This assembly can offer ultra high power and energy density performances."

Typically, a 10 ml of ethylene glycol was added to the above Mn2þ ions solution with constant stirring for 30 min and the pre-prepared Na2HCO3 solution was added drop wise to the above reaction mixture. The reaction solution was turned to brown color, which indicates the formation of MnCO3. Further, the reaction mixture was transferred into an autoclave and maintained at 160 �C for 24 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the MnCO3 precipitates were centrifuged and washed with the water and ethanol for several times to remove the excess organic and inorganic impurities, then dried at 120 �C for 12h to remove water molecules and calcinated at 550 �C for 4 h to obtain porous Mn2O3 nanospheres particles. The same procedure was followed for the synthesis of porous Mn2O3 nanocubes along with the addition of Na2SO4 solution.\nPhase purity and crystallinity of the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes samples were characterized by powder Xray diffraction collected by PAN Analytical X’ per PRO Model X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (α ¼ 1.5418 Å) with 2θ value of 10–80�. Thermo gravimetric analysis at a heating rate of 5 �C/min under O2 atmosphere was carried out to examine the samples thermal stability. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were performed using a Nicolet Avater 370 with KBr pellet technique from 450 to 4000 cm 1. The morphology and surface nature of the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (JEOL-2010F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL/JEM 2100) techniques. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the particles were measured using the micromeritics ASAP-2010 apparatus and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-JoynerHalenda (BJH) methods, respectively."

Three electrodes system with a platinum wire as the counter, SCE as a reference, and prepared porous Mn2O3 nanospheres/ nanocubes as the working electrodes were used to characterize the electrochemical properties in 1 M Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) electrolyte solution. The working electrode slurry was prepared by mixing the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres/nanocubes (70%), acetylene black conducting materials (20%) and PVDF binder (10%) with few drops of 2-NMP solution. Then, the active material (1.5 mg cm 2) was coated onto the pre-weighed nickel foam (1.0 cm � 1.0 cm) and dried at 120 �C for 12 h; coating procedure was repeated for uniform weight of electro active materials coating [19,47].\nThe asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor electrodes were assembled using the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres (1.2 mg cm 2)/nanocubes (1.11 mg cm 2) as the positive electrode and rGO (3.87 mg cm 2) as the negative electrode, cellulosic paper as the separator and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-LiNO3 as the electrolyte.

      "text" : "To investigate the phase purity and the crystallinity of the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes, x-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out and shown in Fig. 1a. The obtained diffraction peaks for porous Mn2O3 nanospheres sample at 2Ө values of 23.14, 32.97, 45.97, 49.37, 55.2, 64.12, 65.8 and 67.51 are corresponding to the respective (211), (222), (332), (134), (440), (145), (622) and (136) planes that are well matched to the cubic crystal nanostructure of Mn2O3 with la-3 space group (JCPDS card No. 41-1442) [46]. Similarly, as the XRD pattern results for the porous Mn2O3nanocubes are exhibiting cubic nature of the phase without any new characteristic peaks for the impurities such as MnCO3, MnO2, and Mn2O4. The broad XRD peaks of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes show that the synthesized samples are nanomaterials and the well crystallinity is confirmed by the appearance of sharp XRD peaks. The four strongest reflections for the planes (222), (440), (211) and (622) were used to calculate the average crystallite size of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes which are 63 nm and 72 nm, respectively [50]. The synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes are expected to provide higher active site and for Liþ ion passage. Thus, characteristic properties will be used for robustness of the supercapacitor with superior electrochemical properties.\nFig. 1b shows the FT-IR spectra of the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes samples which are used to identify the surface distribution of functional groups present in the samples,\nmeasured in the wave number range of 450–4000 cm 1. Both the samples showed five characteristic FT-IR spectral features at 2362, 1432, 685, 582 and 516 cm 1 in the same positions. The peaks appeared at 685, 582 and 516 cm 1 are indicate the presence of stretching vibration of MnO (O–Mn–O–Mn–O with Mn23þ and O32-) in cubic sites [51,52]. A small absorption peak appeared at 1432 cm 1 is due to the bending vibration of H–C–H primary alcohol (ethylene glycol) impurity which was used for the synthesis and the other peak emerged at 2362 cm 1 is attributed to the trace of adsorbed (or) atmospheric CO2 [46]. These TGA, XRD and FT-IR results clearly illustrated that the pure inorganic phase of cubic Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes were obtained at 550 �C using above described synthesis method.\nIn order to get further information about the purity and chemical composition of the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and porous Mn2O3nanocubes samples, we carried out the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S3 depicts the XPS survey spectrum of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and porous Mn2O3 nanocubes, in which the characteristic peaks for the Mn and O are found. Fig. 2a reveled the high-resolution Mn 2p spectrum of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres, two peaks located at 642.0 eV and 653.7 eV with an energy separation of 11.7 eV could be attributed to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 respectively. For the Mn2O3 nanocubes, the Mn\nS. Alagar et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 441 (2019) 227181\n2p signal appears at a binding energy of 642.2 eV and 653.9 eV corresponding to Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 2c). These values agree well with the reported values for the Mn2O3 and indicate that the oxidation state of Mn is þ3. Fig. 2 b and d show the O 1s spectra of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and porous Mn2O3nanocubes, composed of two sharp peaks located at 529.3 (both) and 532.8 (both) correspond to Mn–O–Mn and O–H bonds respectively [9,34].\nScheme 1 presents an overview of the present synthesis route. Briefly, synthesis of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes were synthesized via hydrothermal method using manganese sulphate as Mn2þ ion source. The NaHCO3 was adopted for the slow nucleation and growth for the synthesis of MnCO3 nanospheres and MnCO3 nanocubes, Na2SO4 was used as the directional specific agent. The main chemical reactions are related to the following process [25,53,54].\nH2O þ NaHCO3→ H2CO3 þ NaOH (7)\nH2CO3 þ NaOH → Na2CO3 þ 2H2O (8)\nH2O þ Na2CO3→ CO2 þ Na2 þ 2OH (9)\nCO2 þ 2OH- → CO32- þ H2O (10)\nCO32- þ Mn2þ→ MnCO3 (11)\n2MnCO3 þ ½ O2→ Mn2O3 þ 2CO2 (12)\nThe reaction involves the thermal decomposition of NaHCO3 and generation of OH and CO32- ions, and the CO32- ions react with Mn2þ ions to form the primary particle of MnCO3 spheres/cubes precursor. The kinetic control of MnCO3 primary particles involves in a slow nucleation process. The slow nucleation growth of the primary particles leads to\nnano/submicron size spheres and cubes morphologies. This can be attributed to the migration of mesoporous in the primary particles based on mechanism analogous to the kirkendall effect. During the high temperature calcinations, the fast ostwald diffusion of Mn atoms occurs from the inner core, while the slow inward diffusion of O atoms (O2) occurs from the surface. Where as in the kirkendall effect, long diffusion distance in precursors could occur, leading to the formation of porous interiors in the nano/submicron sized nanospheres and nanocubes morphology of Mn2O3 particles [55].\nThe morphology was evaluated by using electron microscopy. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy images of the synthesized nanospheres and nanocubes morphology of Mn2O3 at different magnifications. The SEM images showed that the synthesized Mn2O3 particles are nano sizes as well as the nanospheres and nanocubes morphology. The Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes are uniform and homogenously distributed with an average size of 230 nm and 250 nm, respectively. Fig. 4 shows the transmission electron micrographs were carried out to substantiate more detailed information about the morphology and the porous structure of the Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes. It can be found from Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes have a porous morphology, which is consistent with the SEM results. And also, Fig. 4 c and f show the lattice fringes of Mn2O3 nanospheres and Mn2O3 nanocubes. In the SAED pattern of Mn2O3 nanospheres, the sharp diffraction spots indicate the single crystalline nature with characteristic planes of (211) with spacing of 0.28 nm. On the other hand, the SAED patterns of Mn2O3 nanocubes exhibits well–defined spots arranged in circular rings confirms the poly crystalline formation with spacing of 0.31 nm (211 plane) [28,42].\nThe Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique was used to determine the\nS. Alagar et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 441 (2019) 227181\nsurface area and pore size of the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes particles. The porous characteristics of the prepared Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes were investigated by typical nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm analysis and shown in Fig. S4. As illustrated in Fig. S4 a and b, the curve exhibited typical Langmuir type IV characteristics with a hysteresis loop of inherent mesoporous material properties with the high-pressure region, capillary conduction and multi-layer adsorption related to the mesoporous properties in the Mn2O3 particle. The BET analysis showed that the specific surface area and pore size of the Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes particles were 36.27 cm3 g 1, 17.87 cm3 g 1 and 4.88 nm, 3.64 nm respectively [17]. This pore size provides sufficient active site for Faraday reaction and numerous channels for the diffusion of ions and electrons within the electrode for electrochemical capacitor applications [42,46]. The surface area and the pore size of the synthesized Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes are expected to be influenced on their electrochemical characteristics. Hence, it can be inferred that the highly porous structure and large surface area of Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes materials will greatly help in enhancing the contact area between the electrode\nand electrolyte, which will be highly beneficial for the fast-electrochemical reaction. Thus, the synthesized Mn2O3 mesoporous nanospheres and nanocubes can provide high specific capacitance and excellent cycle stability as an electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor."

The porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes particles involved in the redox reactions, where the Mn atoms in the surface layer is converted into higher/lower valence states, which was then induced by intercalation/extraction of protons (H3Oþ) or alkali cations (Liþ) into/out of the Mn2O3 electrode mechanism as:\nMn2O3 þ Mþ þ e MMn2O3 …… (13)\nwhere, M ¼ Liþ or H3Oþ. The charge – discharge studies of the fabricated porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes were carried out between 0.1 V and 1.0 V at different current density (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 A g 1) shown in Fig. 5 c and d. The specific capacity of the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes particles were depicted in Fig. S6 a. The specific capacity values of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes were obtained at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 A g 1 and their current densities are 345, 293, 261, 240, 210, 192 and 182 F g 1 and 321, 278, 230, 215, 185, 168 and 150 F g 1, respectively. An outstanding capacitance of 345 F g 1 for porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and 321 F g 1 for porous Mn2O3 nanocubes particles were obtained at a low current density of 0.2 A g 1, indicates the superior capacitance of the synthesized porous Mn2O3 nanospheres electrode materials which is significantly improved capacitance values than the reported in the previous literatures (Table 1). The good cyclic stability and high specific capacitance of porous Mn2O3 nanosphere electrodes are due to their smaller particle size and higher surface area that enables reversible redox reaction at shorter cations transport path. The effect of nanospheres morphology is significantly influenced on their specific capacitance compared to their nanocubes morphology counterpart. Furthermore, for the comparison of Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrode tested in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte discussed in supporting information. A 24% higher capacitance was observed for the 1 M LiNO3 electrolyte than the 1 MNa2SO4 electrolyte suggesting the electrode exhibit higher capacitive character in the LiNO3 electrolyte, where, the specific capacitance of 345 F g 1 and 321 F g 1 are obtained for Mn2O3 nanospheres and 260 F g 1 and 246 F g 1 for Mn2O3 nanocubes in LiNO3 and Na2SO4 electrolytes respectively, implying good capacitive characteristics in the 1 M LiNO3 electrolyte. Therefore, 1 M LiNO3 electrolyte has been chosen as suitable electrolyte for studying electrochemical properties of the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes for supercapacitor application.\nThe electrochemical impedance spectra of the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes were carried out in the frequency range from 100 to 0.01 kHz and shown in Fig. S6 b. The Nyquist plot showed a semicircular region at a high frequency and a Warburg straight line at lower frequency. This clearly indicates the good electrochemical\nbehavior of both the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes. The charge transfer resistances (Rct) at the electrode and electrolyte interface in the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes were determined to be 8.2 Ω and 9.6 Ω respectively. Lower Rct value of the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres electrode in turn, helps to achieve the excellent capacity. On the other hand, the cyclic stability is highly important for the application, particularly in the hybrid electric vehicles and in the renewable energy storage systems. Hence, the longtime cycle stability studies for the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes were measured over 5000 continuous chargedischarge cycles at a current density of 7 A g 1 in 1 M LiNO3 electrolyte, as shown Fig. S6 c. The specific capacitance retention of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes at 5000 cycles were 98% and 89% respectively, the superior specific capacitance of porous Mn2O3 nanospheres is due to its morphology, small size, high surface area and high porosity nature, where, interaction between the electrode/electrolyte is high for higher specific capacitance. The excellent cyclic stability of nanospheres and nanocubes of porous Mn2O3 were compared with the previous reports with various Mn2O3 structures and their capacitance values in three electrode systems are shown in Table 1. Compared to the earlier synthesis methods for various Mn2O3 morphologies synthesis, the results from the hydrothermal method reported in the present study has several advantages such as simplicity, low cost and high energy efficiency. Moreover, hydrothermally synthesized, glycol, SO42- and CO32oriented cubic crystal structured, nanosized Mn2O3 with nanospheres and nanocubes morphologies that are homogeneously distributed and excellent energy storage material for the potential application in electrochemical supercapacitors."

It can be found that the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitors exhibit a highly stable CV curves at the potential window between 0 V and 1.8 V. Interestingly, stable spectra are observed at a higher scanning rate of 50 mV s 1. The rectangular shape of the CV spectra are well preserved, which is higher than that of a conventional activated carbon symmetric capacitors in aqueous electrolytes. Both Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO can be devised into asymmetric supercapacitor. The CV curves at different scanning rates demonstrate an excellent reversibility and rate capability of the device. To further evaluate the performance of the device, a GCD analysis was performed at different current densities from 1 to 10 A g 1 with a potential window of 0–1.8 V and the results are shown in Fig. 7 c and d.\nFurther, the excellent capacity behavior of the device is owing to the contribution from both electrodes behavior EDLC (rGO) and pseudocapacitance (nanospheres/nanocubes of Mn2O3). The high potential windows of the two electrode systems can be achieved. The operating voltage of the asymmetric supercapacitor is achieved to a maximum of 1.8 V in PVA-LiNO3 gel electrolyte. The GCD curves show a linear variation and symmetric profile, suggesting a good charge propagation of the electrode and electrolyte in both solid-state devices. The solidstate device fabricated in the present work has exhibited a good electrochemical capacitive performance and a low internal resistance. The rate capabilities of the Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO are calculated from charge-discharge measurements and illustrated in Fig. S8. The maximum capacitance of 147 F g 1 and 121 F g 1 at 0.2 A g 1 was obtained for Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO in PVA-LiNO3 solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor, respectively. These values are higher than other asymmetric supercapacitors that are reported previously (Table 2) [17,42,56–58].\nThe energy density and power density calculated from the overall full-cell performance of our solid-state asymmetric devices have been compared with other previously reported asymmetric and symmetric supercapacitor device performances. As shown in Fig. 8 a, our device exhibits a maximum energy density of 46 W h kg 1 at a power density of 247 W kg 1 (Mn2O3-s//rGO) and 36 W h kg 1 at a power density of 250 W kg 1 (Mn2O3-c//rGO), which is much higher than that of the symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors reported in literatures [42, 56,58–62]. The superior electrochemical performance of asymmetric supercapacitor of the Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO can be mainly attributed to the following factors: (i) the nano-architectured porous Mn2O3 (positive) electrode materials having high surface area provides a larger zone for ion diffusion and electron transport during the charge-discharge performance and enhance their energy density, (ii) the negative electrode (rGO) has high surface area which enhancing the\nS. Alagar et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 441 (2019) 227181\nelectron and ion transport, ensuring excellent electrochemical performance of the capacitor, (iii) The negative electrode not only does this configuration increase the specific capacitance of the device, it can also enhance the energy density of the device by expanding the potential window, which is much higher than that of conventional activated carbons [63]. Thus, the high capacitance and higher energy density can be obtained even at high rate cycles. This also could be attributed to the abundance of homogeneous porous electrode material. In addition, the synthesized porous nanoarchitectures ensures the high stability upon prolonged cycling at both three and two electrode systems. Thus, the Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO in PVA-LiNO3 solid-state asymmetric\nsupercapacitor represents a novel approach to explore high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.\nThe fabricated solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor full cell devices have been verified for their long term cycle stability, 5000 continuous charge – discharge cycles have been carried out at a high current density of 7 A g 1 and their results are presented in 8 b and c. The endurance of cell performance was observed for both the porous Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO solid-state cells with a negligible specific capacity decay of 4.86% and 8% at the end of the 5000th cycles, respectively. The excellent specific capacity and capacitance retention of our electrodes are due to the nanoarchitecture, the unique interconnected mesoporous\nS. Alagar et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 441 (2019) 227181\nstructure which favors for shorter ions transport and electron diffusion path and lowest the lower charge transfer resistance (Rct). And also, solid state electrolyte can effectively restrain the dissolution of electrode in the on-site reaction with the electrode/electrolyte interaction. The high capacitance of the presently fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor devices is may be attributed due to the higher active surface area of the electrode materials and the mesoporosity of the electrodes. The mesoporous structure of the electrodes enhances the accessibility of the electrolyte, not only at the surface, but also throughout the entire material, by facilitating the electrolyte ion penetration into the interior surfaces and acting as an ion-buffering reservoir.\nThe impedances of the porous Mn2O3-s//rGO and porous Mn2O3-c// rGO asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor with PVA-LiNO3 solid-state electrolyte were measured in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an open circuit potential, by employing an AC voltage of 5 mV at the 1st and 5000th cycles. Typical trend of Nyquist plot was obtained as shown in Fig. S8, which displays a semicircle and a straight line. The semicircle at high frequency region is due to the charge transfer resistance, followed by a linear shape at low frequency region attributed to the ion diffusion process in the bulk active mass [64,65]. Inset Fig. S9 gives the equivalent circuit fit of the impedance curve obtained for the working electrode of the supercapacitor. The electrochemical impedance spectral data are fitted by the (electrolyte resistance) internal resistance (Rs), the charge transfer resistance (Rct), the Warburg impedance (Zw) and the constant phase element (CPE) to address the double-layer capacitance. The impedance spectra analysis shows that the as-assembled cell has a low solution resistance (Rs) of 4.96 Ω and 5.65 Ω for the porous Mn2O3-s//rGO and porous Mn2O3-c//rGO device respectively, which are slightly increased on 5000 cycling to 6.47 Ω and\n8.41 Ω respectively. This low Rs resistance demonstrates the stability of the electrolyte and electrodes, where the common phenomenon of Mn dissolution into the electrolyte is suppressed. Initially, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of porous Mn2O3nanocubes electrodes is slightly higher than the spheres electrode materials and on cycling it is increased to 16.18 Ω, the same trend is observed for the porous Mn2O3 nanospheres. The increased value of Rct after 5000th continuous cycles is due to the irreversibility of the inter-grain charge transfer rate. However, the progressively improved performances of the previously fabricated electrode are sustained. Here, we have demonstrated the practical application of our fabricated asymmetric solid-state device by connecting porous Mn2O3 - s//rGO and Mn2O3 - c//rGO (1 � 2 cm2) devices in series. After charging the fabricated supercapacitor for 30 s, they were able to light up 21 red rounds light emitting diodes (LED, 2.7 V, with ALU arrangements, Fig. 8d, Video S9) assembled in parallel for more than 3 min. These promising results suggest that the nanospheres and nanocubes Mn2O3//rGO solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor possess an excellent energy storage property, which can be suggested for practical applications.\nSupplementary video related to this article can be found at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227181."

The XRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM and HR-TEM results confirm that the Mn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes were prepared at 550 �C calcination. The porous\nS. Alagar et al.\nJournal of Power Sources 441 (2019) 227181\nMn2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes electrodes in three electrode system exhibit an excellent specific capacity of 345 F g 1 and 321 F g 1 at 0.2 A g 1, respectively and an outstanding cycling stability of 98% (nanospheres Mn2O3) and 89% (nanocubes) capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. A solid-state asymmetric device was fabricated with positive (Mn2O3-s/Mn2O3–c) and negative (rGO) electrodes using PVALiNO3 gel electrolyte and observed a higher specific capacitance of 147 F g 1 and 121 F g 1 at 0.2 A g 1 for Mn2O3-s//rGO and Mn2O3-c// rGO devices respectively. Moreover, the optimized asymmetric supercapacitor (Mn2O3 –s//rGO and Mn2O3-c//rGO) has a high output cell voltage of 1.8 V and thus provided higher energy density (46 Wh kg 1 and 36 Wh kg 1) and higher power density (2400 W kg 1 at 12 Wh kg 1 and 2000 W kg 1 at 6 Wh kg 1). The devised asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor provides an excellent cycling stability with a negligible decay ( 5% loss- Mn2O3 – s//rGO, 8% loss - Mn2O3-c//rGO) up to the 5000th cycle. Accordingly, an excellent electrochemical performance was also tapped by Lighting 21 red LEDs assembled in ALU parallel, further, actualized the practical application of these electrodes as a promising candidate for asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor. We believe that this study, with its promising results can open up the possibility of transition-metal oxides for asymmetric supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, fuel cells, catalysis, biosensors and other hybrid electronic devices."
