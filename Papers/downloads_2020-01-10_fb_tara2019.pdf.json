INTRODUCTION\nAlready, the current world is facing the problem of shortage of pure drinking water because of limited sources of clean and pure water. Due to rapid growth in industries, a wide range of wastes are generated from the industries and are ultimately discharged into water resources, thereby affecting the quality and aesthetic of water [1-10]. This is a very serious concern for developing countries. Among various wastes generated from the industries, colour substances, particularly, dyes are the most discharged pollutants. Dyes are utilized in textile, paper printing, carpet, plastic, food and cosmetic industries [11, 12]. Fabric and textile industries use dyes as a colourant on a large scale and commercially about 0.1 million dyes are available and approximately 7.0 × 105 metric tons dyes are produced annually [13, 14]. The total dye consumption in textile industries is more than 10,000\n*Address correspondence to this author at the Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; Tel: +917827092932; E-mail: editorinamuddin@gmail.com\ntonnes per year, and about 10-15% dyes are released into water from textile industries [15-19]. Dyes can be mutagenic, carcinogenic, and allergenic to the human body, therefore, the contamination of dyes in water can be hazardous for aquatic organisms as well as humans [20-22].\nDyes are organic compounds consisting of chromophores (-NO2, -NO, -N=N) and auxochromes (-OH, -NH2, -NHR, - NR2, -Cl, -COOH etc.). Chromophores are responsible for imparting colour to dyes and auxochromes enhance the colour intensity of the dyes for the substrate to which they are being applied. Generally, dyes are water soluble and produce light colour in water, although some dyes impart very dark colour even at very low concentration. Dyes can either be natural which are obtained from plants, animals, insects, and natural mineral sources, or they can be synthetic which are associated with the serious hazardous problem for the water stream due to their non-biodegradable complex molecular structures [23-26]. William Henry Perkin discovered the first synthetic dye in 1856, named Mauveine, which was organic aniline dye (https://www.britannica.com/biography/\n1875-6727/20 $65.00+.00 © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers\nNano-Engineered Adsorbent for the Removal of Dyes from Water Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 15\nWilliam-Henry-Perkin). Dyes are classified as acidic and basic. Acidic dyes are salts of sulphuric, carboxylic, or phenolic groups, and are water-soluble and can be partly or fully attached to the cationic substrate such as wool, silk, nylon and acrylic fibres [27]. On the other hand, basic dyes are cationic dyes which contain the monoazoic, diazoic and azine compounds [27-48]. Among various acidic dyes, congo red (CR) is the most common water-soluble dye which is widely used in the cotton textile, wood pulp, and paper industries. The CR shows strong, non-covalent, bonding to cellulose fibre [48-52]. It was first synthesized by Paul Bottiger, who was working for Friedrich Bayer Company in Elberfeld, Germany, in 1883 [48]. It is the sodium salt of benzidinediazo-bis-1-naphthylamine-4-sulfonic acid (formula: C32H22N6Na2O6S2; molecular weight: 696.66 gmol-1) (Fig. 1).\nNa +\nNH2\nS\nN\nN O\nO -\nO\nN\nN\nNH2\nS O\n- O\nO\nNa +\nFig. (1).

Structure of rhodamine B.\nRB is easily detected by a specific instrument called fluorometer because of its fluorescence properties. RB is used in biotechnology and has applications in the biology field such as fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA test and as a staining fluorescent dye. Sometimes, RB combines with Auramine O dye, and the stain of the Auramine-Rhodamine product is used to demonstrate the acid-fast organism reaction like Mycobacterium. Some Rhodamine dyes are also known as laser dyes [53-55].\nAmong various basic dyes, malachite green (MG) (Fig. 3) is the most common basic dye, which imparts green colour to aqueous solution, having the chemical formula C52H54N4O12, with 927.00 gmol-1 of molecular weight.\nMG is one of the most important organic dyes which is a controversial agent from the aquaculture field and is used as a dyestuff. MG is generally used in the colouring of silk, jute, wool, leather, paper and distilleries. Furthermore, it is\nalso used as a food colouring agent, food additive and in medical disinfectants [42-46]. Methylene blue (MB) (Fig. 4) is another common basic dye discovered by Heinrich Caro in 1876, with a heterocyclic aromatic structure having the chemical formula C16H18N3SCl (MW =319.65 g mol-1) [47].\nN +\nCH3\nCH3\nN\nCH3\nCH3\nCl -\nFig. (3).

Structure of methylene blue.\nMB is widely used for printing, colouring of paper, dyeing of wool, cotton, tannin, clothes, as a temporary hair colourant and as an indicator in the oxidation-reduction process. It is widely used for antiseptic purpose [47]. Another basic dye is Methyl violet or Crystal violet which is a green powder of N-(4-(bis (4-(dimethylamino) phenyl) methylene) cyclohexa-2, 5-dien-1-ylidene) methanaminium chloride (Fig. 5). The colour of Methyl violet dye depends on methyl groups attached to the dye.\nN CH3 CH3\nN\nCH3\nCH3 NH +\nCH3\nCl -\nFig. (5).

      "heading" : "2. EFFECT OF TOXIC DYES ON LIVING ORGANISMS",
      "text" : "Dyes such as CR, RB, MB, MV, and CV are a serious concern for society because of their complex structures and non-biodegradable nature, which makes them toxic for living organisms. These dyes affect the ecosystem and are mostly\n16 Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 Tara et al.\ncarcinogenic. These coloured compounds not only destroy aesthetic quality but also restrict sunlight penetration in water which affects living organisms in water [6, 59]. Among various dyes, MB and MV are the most toxic towards living things [60-66].\nAcidic dyes show harmful effects to eyes, respiratory system, skin, may cause cancer and mutagenicity in human [17, 62, 67-74]. Basic dyes are also toxic, may cause allergic problems, skin irritation, mutations, and even skin cancer, increase heart rate, besides an increase in the incidence of shock, vomiting, cyanosis, jaundice, quadriplegia, and tissue necrosis in human beings [75].\nWastewater released from textile industries also contains metal ions which come as an impurity from chemicals used during the processing, and from metal based mordent dyes that are mostly based on chromium. Generally, chromium based complex dyes are carcinogenic and show harmful effects towards aquatic life [76-84].\nAccording to Kadirvelu et al., 2003 [80], most dyes are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and can also damage the organs of human beings such as kidneys, lungs, liver, brain, reproductive system and central nervous system [85, 86]. Amines group present in azo dyes is the main reason for the toxicity of azo dyes. Water soluble reactive dyes in water also cause serious problems for the aquatic environment [76]. Therefore, dyes are a dangerous class of organic pollutants in the environment and are released into water resources in a direct and indirect way, thus dyes treatment from wastewater or drinking water is a great environmental concern. Many methods such as physical (sedimentation, filtration, floatation, coagulation, reverse osmosis, solvent extraction, and adsorption), chemical (neutralization, reduction, oxidation, catalysis, ion exchange and electrolysis), and biological (stabilization, aerated lagoons, trickling filters, activated sludge, fungal treatment, flocculation and anaerobic digestion) are being utilized for the removal of dyes from water [87]. These methods are reliable and show precise results for removal of toxic dyes from water. However, they also have some limitations, like high processing charge, being less effective for low concentration and tough to handle. Besides, adsorption is most effective for the removal of toxic dyes from water, in terms of its simplicity, low cost, easy handling and operation [6, 59, 88-90].\nAdsorption is a surface phenomenon in multi-component fluid (gas or liquid) where a molecule (solute) is attached to the surface of a solid substance by chemical and physical\nbonds [91]. Such substances that provide the surface (space) are called adsorbents, while the molecule which is removed from the liquid phase is known as the adsorbate [92, 93]. Today, the adsorption phenomenon is beneficial to implement for the water purification. Dyes contain the chromogenic group which helps the dye molecules to easily adsorb onto the adsorbent surfaces [94-101]. Schematic representation of the removal of dye using adsorbent from the wastewater is shown in Fig. (6).\nThere are many factors such as adsorbate-adsorbent interaction, adsorbent surface area, adsorbent to adsorbate ratio, adsorbent particle size, temperature, pH and contact time, which are responsible for the removal rate of pollutants (Fig. 7) [93, 102-105]. In-depth studies of these optimized parameters can be helpful in the removal of dyes effectively and in the development of industrial-scale water treatment process. Recently, nanoparticles (NPs) as adsorbents are being utilized for the purification of water, which has a great scope in water treatment. These desirable NPs are produced with unique properties such as large surface area-to-volume ratios, and have surface functional properties to treat the toxic pollutants.\nFig. (7). Factors which effect adsorption efficiency in the adsorption process."

      "heading" : "3. APPLICATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN DYES REMEDIATION",
      "text" : "Nanotechnology is a modern field of science which plays an important role in water treatment [106, 107]. The ‘Nano’ word is derived from the Greek word ‘Nanos’ which means\nFig. (6). Dye adsorption process.\nNano-Engineered Adsorbent for the Removal of Dyes from Water Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 17\ndwarf or extremely small and is considered as the billionth (1 × 10-9) part of a meter. NPs size ranges from 1-100 nm and it is dispersed in all medium such as gaseous, liquid or solid. These features make them very attractive for a wide range of applications [108-110]. NPs can be classified as inorganic NPs [111], polymeric NPs [112], solid lipids [113], liposomes [114], nanocrystal [115], nanotubes, and dendrimers [116]. Various types of nanomaterials reported in literature are shown in Fig. (8).\nThe top-down and bottom-up approaches are preferred for making NPs (Fig. 9) and synthesis of NPs can be possible through physical, chemical, and bio-assisted methods.\nChemical method is an important process because it takes a short time for the synthesis of a large number of NPs. In this method, capping agents are necessary for the synthesis of NPs which stabilize the size of NPs (Fig. 10). Polymeric\nNPs can be prepared by the polymerization of various monomers such as methacrylic acid, acrylic esters or metacrylics, etc. [117]. The formation of inorganic NPs can be carried out in the presence of polymers such as PLA and PLG, etc. [118- 122]. Currently, three chemical techniques viz., dispersion of preformed polymers, polymerization of monomers and ionic gelation or coacervation of hydrophilic polymers are applied and aimed at synthesizing a different variety of polymeric NPs (Figs. 11 and 12).\nChoudhury et al. [121] discussed the organic and inorganic materials like polymers, neutral polymers, polyelectrolytes, amphiphilic polymer, etc. (Fig. 11) having various characteristics such as size, surface charge, hydrophilicity, functionality and biocidal activity, which provide the protective/sacrificial layers to membrane surface against different foulants and microorganisms.\nFig. (8).

[121], copyright (2018) RSC (License No.4357641251033).\nThe physical preparation methods for metal or metal oxide NPs can be categorized as evaporation-condensation, solgel technique (Fig. 13), solvothermal synthesis, chemical reduction and laser ablation, etc. The evaporationcondensation and laser ablation techniques are the most popular physical methods for the preparation of NPs which show advantages over the chemical synthesis.\nAmong various approaches, the biological method is a highly effective method for the preparation of NPs due to its eco-friendly approach. NPs which are synthesized by natural materials like plants, fungi, yeast, bacteria, viruses, proteins, peptides and enzymes etc. are classed in this category (Fig. 14) [124-128].\nAn overview of a different type of synthesis methods to produce a variety of NPs is given in below Table 1.\nVarious techniques are given in Fig. (15), which help to investigate the characteristic properties such as particle size, shape, crystallinity, fractal dimensions, pore size and surface area, orientation, intercalation and dispersion of synthesized NPs [129-138]. Due to the unique characteristics of NPs, these can be the most promising materials for water purification applications. Herein, most of the valuable literature available on dyes remediation using nano-engineered adsorbents has been discussed."

Fe3O4-wheat straw MB 1374.60 [292]\nstudied the maximum adsorption capacity of zero valent iron (ZVI) NPs for the removal of vat green dye from water. Iron oxide, consisting of different phases such as hematite (αFe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), akaganeite (β-Fe2O3) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) has also been utilized as an adsorbent for the removal of dyes from water. Different approaches such as reduction, hydrolysis, disproportionation, oxidation [141], sol-gel, high-pressure hydrothermal [142], and co-precipitation methods [143, 144] have been adopted to prepare iron oxide NPs. Iron oxide and ZVI mixed NPs have also been utilized for the elimination of hazardous and toxic waste pollutants from water, and their catalytic and super-magnetic property showed greater efficiency and advances for dye removal. Zhang and Kong [145] synthesized the magnetic Fe3O4 core-shell ZVI NPs used for the removal of MB and CR dyes. The maximum adsorption capacity for MB and CR was 44.38 and 11.22 mg/g, respectively. Advances in iron oxides and ZVI NPs were also made by the mixing of these particles with other organic and/or inorganic materials.\nThe molecular size of the dye and the number of groups attached to the dye are also responsible for fluctuation in adsorption. An adsorbent with nano-size having large surface area may efficiently remove the dye molecules, however, the exhausted nano-sized particles are difficult to separate from the water after adsorption, which on long term exposure may create toxicity itself. With the use of magnetic NPs, like iron oxides, these problems can be reduced somehow. However, more efforts are needed to make the process more efficient and advanced. Generally, adsorption is a non-selective phenomenon, thus unwanted pollutants from wastewater can be adsorbed onto the solid support. This greatly affects the dyesorption capacity of support solid, in an unpredictable manner. To reduce these short comings; great efforts have been made in the water treatment method using modified NPs. NPs, particularly magnetic NPs, were incorporated into the solid support to separate from water post adsorption and also increased the active sites onto the adsorbent surface. Alzahrani et al. [146] prepared the magnetic ZVI NPs (MNPs) by\n28 Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 Tara et al.\nco-prepetition methods and loaded them on Arabic gum. The maximum adsorption capacity of this MNP was 14 mg/g for MB. Novel bimetallic Fe-Zn NPs were synthesized by using the co-precipitation method and they were applied for the adsorptive removal of MG and CR from the water. Batch adsorption experiments were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity of adsorbent in terms of various parameters such as the solution pH 2-10, initial dye concentration 25- 100 mg/L, etc. The maximum adsorption capacity of NPs was observed as 21.74 and 28.56 mg/g for MG and CR, for 60 min of contact time, respectively [151]. Agarwal et al. [152] studied the adsorption capacity of iron NPs loaded ash (nFe-A) for the removal of MG from the water. They optimized the various parameters such as solution pH, initial dye ion concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage, temperature, etc. The kinetic data was well explained with the pseudo-second-order-model and well followed the Langmuir isotherm.\nThe magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles, modified with pyrrole (PPy@Fe3O4 MNPs) were also used as adsorbents for the removal of RB. The maximum adsorption capacity of for RB was found to be 112.36 mg/g [153]. Dalvand et al. [154] prepared L-arginine modified Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, Fe3O4@L-arginine, and studied their adsorption capacity for reactive blue dye. At optimum conditions, such as 50 mg/L initial dye concentration, an adsorbent dosage of 0.74 g/L, pH 3 removed 96.34% dye from water. The process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm. Advances in nanotechnology have also been made when researchers synthesized the NPs with low toxicity using a green method by utilizing the plant extract as reducing and stabilizing agents. Plant-mediated NPs have also been used for the removal of dye from water [147-150].\nIn addition to iron, other metal based nanoparticles and their composites have also been synthesized for water purification and have shown excellent adsorption capacity for different types of dyes. For example copper oxide, CuO, NPs have been synthesized by various methods and used for the removal of many dyes such as MB, MO, CR, CV, etc. [155- 157]. Mustafa et al. [155] synthesized the CuO NPs by precipitation method and used for the MB remediation. 88.93% MB could be removed with 0.02-0.2 g amount of adsorbent. Mekewi et al. [156] synthesized CuO NPs which were chemically activated with montmorillonite clay (MMT), and found out its maximum adsorption capacity for MB. Similarly, a facile sol-gel method was adopted by Taufik and Salah [157] to synthesize the iron(II,III)oxide/zinc(II)oxide/copper (II)oxide (Fe3O4/ZnO/CuO) nano-composites, and further used for decolourization of water. The Fe3O4/ZnO/CuO nanocomposites with different amount of CuO NPs were used for photo-sonocatalytic degradation of MB dye under UV or visible light and ultrasound combination. Taufik and Saleh [157] also observed that a higher amount of CuO gives faster degradation under visible light and lower amount of CuO NPs gave highest photo-sonocatalytic performance under UV light.\nSasikala et al. [158] studied that the cerium loaded CuO NPs effectively degraded and remediated azo dyes such as\nMO and TB under UV light irradiation. They also compared the adsorption capacity of pure CuO NPs and cerium loaded CuO NPs. Karimi et al. [159] reported the use of silver NPs doped activated carbon (Ag-NP-AC) for the removal of MO. They observed that with an increase in pH, the adsorption of MO also increased and attained maximum adsorption capacity. The removal percentage increased from 67.33 to 98.75% with an increase in the pH from 2 to 5. Mady et al. [160] synthesized the silver NPs and their nano-composites (AgZnFe2O4@rGO) by one-pot microwave method, and Yang et al. [161] prepared the Ag2ZnV4O12 nanocomposite by the sol-gel process. These NPs and nanocomposites were efficient in the removal of organic dyes such as MB, MO and RB under UV and visible-light irradiation in water treatment.\nSaharan et al. [162] studied the degradation effect of Nidoped ZnO NPs for anionic (Fast green) and cationic (Victoria blue) dyes. They compared the degradation capacity of un-doped and doped ZnO NPs within pH range 3-10. Yavari et al. [163] prepared the CoFe2O4 NPs and modified them with the amine groups and used them as adsorbents for Direct red 80, DR80, direct green 6 (DG6), and acid blue 92 (AB92). The maximum adsorption capacity of the above dyes was found to be 333.33, 384.61, and 625 mg/g, respectively, at pH 2. Singh et al. [128] performed batch experiment for cationic dyes, like CR remediation using surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS, coated cobalt ferrite nanoparticles and investigated the effect of various parameters, such as initial concentration (50-300 mg/L), contact time, adsorbent dose (0.1-0.5 gm/50 mL), and pH (2-9) at a constant temperature. These SDS coated cobalt ferrite nanoparticles showed a much higher adsorption capacity.\nCantarella et al. [164] and Scuderi et al. [165] developed active TiO2 nanostructures in poly methyl methacrylate, PMMA. Ni magnetic NPs showed high photocatalytic activity which was enhanced by SiO2/TiO2 particles (NiSiO2/TiO2) through hydrolysis process. They compared the photocatalytic activity of two different percentages, 6 wt% Ni-SiO2/TiO2, and 3 wt% Ni-SiO2/TiO2, and observed that the 6 wt% of Ni-SiO2/TiO2 showed higher photo-degradation efficiency for AB dye [166].\nRajesh et al. [167] synthesized hybrid copper oxide nanoneedles-graphene oxide sheets (GO-CuO-NNs) through the sonochemical method. They focused on controlling effective concentration of the active CuO nanoneedles on the graphene oxide sheets. Hybrid GO-CuO NNs were successfully applied for the removal of hazardous organic dyes, such as brilliant blue, methylene blue, congo red and amido black, 10B, etc. The cationic dyes MG and MV were also successfully removed from water using low cost, new and efficient, magnetic nano-composites with different polymers such as magnetic NPs coated with poly(dimethylaminoethyl) acrylamide and methyl acrylate on modified mFe3O4 NPs. It was observed that on increasing the pH of the solution, adsorption capacities of the prepared adsorbent for MG and MV also increased due to strong electrostatic interaction between the cationic dyes and active sites on the adsorbent. The maximum adsorption capacities of MG and MV were found to be 890 and 1780 mg/g, respectively. It was also\nNano-Engineered Adsorbent for the Removal of Dyes from Water Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 29\nconcluded that the process followed pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models [168, 169].\nFalah et al. [170] synthesized mixed Cu2O/TiO2 NPs in an inorganic geopolymer matrix and modified them by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB, for the removal of methylene blue. Similarly, chitosan (Ch) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) modified TiO2 (Ch/PMA/TiO2) microparticle were produced using inverse suspension polymerization method and applied for textile wastewater treatment. Ch/ PMA/TiO2 micro-particles completely removed various dyes such as AO7, AR18, AB113, RB5 and DB78 from the water. The pH had a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of Ch/PMA/TiO2 micro-particles. After three illumination cycles, dyes were maintained at a high level of 95% at pH 5.6 and 100% at pH 2 and 8 [171, 172].\nGlutaraldehyde cross-linked magnetic chitosan NPs (GMCNs) were synthesized to evaluate their adsorption capacity for brilliant blue 1 and yellow 5 dyes. Adsorption capacity was largely affected by various parameters such as initial pHs, initial dye concentrations, temperatures, etc. Maximum adsorption capacities of GMCNs were observed as 475.61 and 292.07 mg/g, for brilliant blue 1 and yellow 5 dyes, respectively at pH 3 and at 25ºC. The reaction followed pseudo-second order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm model [173]. Liang et al. [174] synthesized the CuO NPs loaded spherical mesoporous silica (meso-silica MCM-41). The adsorption capacity for CR and MB was observed as 52.9 and 87.8 mg/g with CuO/MCM-41. N-iso-propylacrylamide was polymerized with acrylic acid (AA) and Nallylisatin, in the presence of a surfactant, such as aerosol (AOT) and sorption activity of cationic dyes such as methylene blue (BB-9), auramine O (BY-2) and chrysoidine G (BO-2) onto nano-hydrogel was observed. 98.24, 87.42 and 70.12% of dyes were remediated from 300, 200 and 150 mg/L of BB-9, BY-2 and BO-2, respectively [175]. The silver NPs (Ag-NPs) have the unique potential to remove the dye pollutants [176-178] and have been used by Marahel et al. [179] for Sudan red 7B dye. The maximum adsorption capacity of the prepared adsorbent for Sudan red 7B dye was found to be 90.909 mg/g, at pH 4-5 and the initial concentration 5-100 mg/L. Some other adsorbents were also used for the same purposes [180]. Meng et al. [181] doped the TiO2 NPs into single-wall carbon nanotubes as an acceptor of electrons, and observed higher photocatalytic efficiency under UV irradiation as compared to virgin TiO2 NPs. Zimbone et al. [182] also used the TiO2 NPs for wastewater treatments. M-doped TiO2 NPs (M=Cu and Zn) were also prepared for water treatment by Khairy and Zakariya [183] and Yoong et al. [184].\nLots of functionalized nanohybrid composites shown excellent properties for remediation of dyes from wastewater [185-190]. The polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane based cross-linked inorganic-organic nanohybrid composite was shown higher adsorption capacity of 237.5mgg-1 for MO dye [184].\nPal et al. [282] synthesized the mixed oxide NPs of Ti, Si, and Al and observed a much higher adsorption capacity for these three oxides nanostructures. A composite of mag-\nnesium chloride premixed with polyacrylamide (MCPAM) was synthesized for the removal of reactive dyes from wastewater. They showed higher pH was the best working pH. It was able to remove 99% of dyes from wastewater [197]. Many researchers have focused on the removal of dyes from aqueous solutions by using commercially available super adsorbent polymer, such as Jalshakti (JS) [283]. The batch experiment was performed with this adsorbent for the adsorption of MB. The MB adsorption capacity increased from 138.9 to 1428.6 mg/g on increasing the initial concentration of MB from 100-1000 mg/L, respectively [283]. The chitosan grafted poly (quaternary ammonium)/Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by graft copolymerization of TMAAC onto the chitosan chain in the presence of redox initiator. The adsorbent was pH sensitive and showed higher adsorption capacity for dye. The adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order model and data well fitted to the Langmuir isotherm. These magnetic NPs were regenerated and reused [284].\nThe above cited NPs and their modified forms can be eco-friendly, and economically significant for dye remediation. The advantages of recent advancement in the NPs over the virgin NPs have already been cited above. Excluding the above cited adsorbents, a large number of other adsorbents, including agricultural waste, and green or bio-adsorbents have been utilized for dye removal from water due to of their low cost, eco-friendly nature, and high efficiency for the removal of dyes at low concentration [6]. However, the efficiency of adsorbent not only depends on water constraints but also the parameters like dye concentration, temperature, and dose involved during the process. In addition to this, porosity, surface area and the presence of hydroxyl or other functional groups on the surface and regeneration of adsorbent also decide their efficiency, and highly porous and high surface area containing adsorbents with high regeneration power are more significant than others [6, 285- 290]. Among these, bioadsorbents, agriculture wastes are the most abundant and about free of cost with lowest toxicity even healthy for human health [6], however, these may release their organic contents into water during the reaction. Moreover, these are not so suitable for separation from water post adsorption thus lower regeneration power leads to the production of sludge in water during adsorption as well as low adsorption capacities. Therefore, a lot of efforts have been undertaken for these adsorbents to make the process more sustainable and efficient [6, 290]. To demonstrate suitability of these adsorbents, particularly bio-adsorbents, nanomaterials have been incorporated in these materials and higher adsorption capacities over the other adsorbents, have been reported. Tian et al. [291] reported the preparation of magnetic baker’s yeast biomass and use for the bioadsorption of MV from water. The used adsorbent could easily be recycled post adsorption using an external magnetic field. Results from this study revealed that the regeneration efficiency of used adsorbent was higher than 80% after third adsorption-desorption cycle. The maximum adsorption capacity of magnetic baker’s yeast biomass for MV was 60.84 mg/g. The higher adsorption capacity of magnetic baker’s yeast biomass was due to the functional groups onto their\n30 Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 Tara et al.\nsurface. Similarly, magnetic wheat straw (Fe3O4-wheat straw) was prepared and used for water treatment [292]. The prepared adsorbent showed extraordinary maximum adsorption capacity for MB which was found to be 1374.6 mg/g. New attempts for simultaneous antibacterial behaviour of nanoparticle modified bio-adsorbent have also been reported to make the adsorbent microbes resistant [293, 294]. The formation of bio-films (bacterial layer) onto the solid surface is also a major problem with the adsorbent which is another drawback with adsorbents, therefore, these days, microbesresistant adsorbents are being developed for water purification. Besides the commercial antibiotics, NPs and phytogenic plant materials can be a good choice for the antimicrobial applications. The mixing of these two components can be the best attempt for developing the antibacterial adsorbent. Recently, Siddiqui and Chaudhry [293] have reported the preparation of MnFe2O4 incorporated Black cumin seeds which were used for the inhibition of gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as the removal of MB from water. The developed material has shown a maximum adsorption capacity of 10.07 mg/g for MB and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli cells with a zone of inhibition 21 and 20 mm, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli cells was 40, and 35 mg/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of used adsorbent was due to the presence of phytogenic contents in black cumin. Moreover, the used adsorbent could be regenerated and reused for a number of cycles. Therefore, these types of new approaches can be highly effective for screening the adsorbent for water treatment.\n5. ADVANTAGES OF NANO-ENGINEERED ADSORBENT\nLow cost and abundant materials like activated carbon, clay minerals, waste materials, and biomasses are being used for decolourizing of coloured water but, their separation from the water after equilibrium is a difficult, costly, and slow process. Generally, filtration and centrifugation are used for the separation of exhausted materials. The filtration process is cost-effective but very slow and centrifugation is a fast process but needs costly instruments, and is therefore avoided.\nThe development of magnetic NPs is taking advantages over the above methods due to their low cost, fast separation process and easy handling. This separation process using a low gradient magnetic field enhances the adsorptive removal capacity of a particular magnetic adsorbent by repeating the adsorption-desorption cycle of exhausted adsorbent using acid or base.\nRecently, abundant materials such as activated carbon, biomass, agriculture waste, and clay minerals have been modified with magnetic NPs to enhance the adsorption capacity of adsorbents. The modification of above materials using NPs enhances their porosity and surface area, and incorporation of magnetic NPs also imparts magnetic character to these materials to separate them from the water after adsorption which shows higher adsorption capacity for colour stuff after a number of adsorption-desorption cycles.\nIn addition, functionalized nano-sized adsorbents, having a large number of functional groups on their surfaces, have become the most attractive and smart techniques for water purification. Functionalized NPs strongly trap the colour contents at various pH. A large number of functionalized nano-sized adsorbents are being used for dye’s remediation from wastewater. This can be obtained by the functionalization of NPs through higher acids. Furthermore, to prevent the formation of bio-films onto the solid surface which is also a major problem, microbe resistant adsorbents are now being developed for water purification by mixing the nanoparticles and natural plant materials. The major drawback of the above adsorbent is a detachment of NPs from modified materials during the adsorption process which also produces the toxicity on long-term accumulation in water. Therefore, various environmentally sound and stable adsorbents need to be developed.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this review article, the ever-increasing problem of dye pollutants and ways of dye remediation has been discussed. The environment-friendly technique of adsorption is brought into light. The enhanced properties of the nanomaterials because of their small size and ways of synthesizing them have been summed up. A wide range of nanomaterials such as metals, metal oxide, polymer composites, and nanoparticles incorporating activated carbon, biomass, and clay minerals, etc. have been included. Adsorption depends upon the chemical nature of the material, various physicochemical experimental conditions such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature, etc. Therefore, these factors are widely used for evaluating the adsorption capacity of dyes onto the different adsorbent.\nFUTURE PROSPECTS\nThe various methods developed for the synthesis of NPs and the use of NPs as adsorbents for the removal of dyes provide a path for further research and development of more efficient NPs with higher adsorption capacity for different dyes to reduce the number of effluents discharged from various industries and thus reduce the pollution in our surroundings.\nCONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\nNot applicable.\nFUNDING\nThe financial support from the University Grant Commission, UGC, India and Department of Chemistry, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India, is gratefully acknowledged.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest, financial or otherwise.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nDeclared none.\nNano-Engineered Adsorbent for the Removal of Dyes from Water Current Analytical Chemistry, 2020, Vol. 16, No. 1 31"
