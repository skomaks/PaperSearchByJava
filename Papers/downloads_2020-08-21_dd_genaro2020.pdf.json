      "text" : "Glass ionomer cement (GIC) is a dental material that contains fluoraluminosilicate glass in its powder composition of calcium, basic silicon oxide, aluminum oxide and calcium, magnesium, and sodium fluoride. The liquid is an aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid, tartaric acid, and itaconic acid, which has biological compatibility [1], adherence to the tooth structure [2], and antibacterial properties [3], among other desirable properties. Even so, its u se as restorative material is still limited due to its brittleness and low compressive strength [4] when compared to other restorative materials. In order to overcome these limitations, the resin-modified GIC (RMGIC) was developed. In addition to the acid–base reaction, RMGICs have a polymerization reaction as they have resin monomers in their composition [5,6]. In most cases, this polymerization is photo-initiated. Recently, the incorporation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANP) to RMGIC has shown promising results such as the increase in adhesive strength to dentin [7]. In addition, it has been shown to favor increased enamel remineralization [8]. Nanoparticles show good results when added to restorative materials [9].\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1412; doi:10.3390/nano10071412 www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1412 2 of 12\nThe incorporation of HANP to the conventional GIC at 12% concentration showed improvement in microhardness, resistance to compression, and diametrical traction [10]. Concentrations of 2% and 8% also provided improvements in fracture resistance [7]. Thus, when using RMGIC, the addition of HANP could improve its biological properties, since in vitro tests demonstrate that the cytotoxic effects of RMGIC are more evident when compared to conventional GIC [11,12]. Del Angel-Mosqueda et al. [13] (2018) carried out a cytotoxicity study analyzing gingival fibroblasts, where the photopolymerized medium was treated with 100 mg/mL of hydroxyapatite of lyophilized bone for 24 h at room temperature in response to Vitrebond RMGIC and found that there was an increase in cell viability, suggesting that HA plays a protective role, decreasing the cytotoxic effect. Studies on the association of NPs and GIC show promising results [7,14,15], however, few have performed cytotoxicity tests [16], which are fundamental and precede the application of the material to the oral cavity. It is known that the American Dental Association (ADA) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI-ISO-10993) recommend preclinical tests such as cytotoxicity assays developed in cell culture, laboratory animal tests, and finally used on humans [17,18]. The effect of adding NPs depends on its proper distribution and dispersion in the restorative material and there is no research related to different techniques for incorporating NP into the GIC, a technical step that certainly influences the properties of this material, so it is important to conduct research with this theme. We observed studies analyzing only GIC encapsulated in the powder/liquid mixing method using mechanical manipulators in different potentials [19]. The properties of the material are also strongly related to its microstructure, which in turn depends on the size and homogeneous distribution of its particles [20], which result in the quality of its mechanical resistance [21]. The analysis of different methods of incorporation of NP into the GIC is innovative and important, since it will contribute to adjust the conditions of homogeneity of NP distribution and dispersion within the material. According to Moshaverinia et al. [7], the concentration of 2% HANP added to the GIC demonstrated improvements in its physical and mechanical properties. Additionally, the 5% and 10% concentrations are new to be tested. Thus, these concentrations were chosen to be used in the tests proposed in this study. The development of research on this subject may, in the near future, improve the properties of the material, facilitate clinical procedures, and make them more effective and long lasting. In this way, it is essential to carry out studies that, aside from evaluating the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the association of NPs to the RMGIC, also evaluate biological properties, making it safe and effective for clinical application. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different techniques of the incorporation of HANP in different concentrations to the RMGIC regarding the distribution and dispersion, porosity, and cytotoxicity. The null hypothesis of this study is that there is no improvement in the physical-biological properties of glass ionomer cement after the addition of HANP."

This monomer is capable of inducing apoptosis by increasing oxidative stress induced by an excess of reactive oxygen species, damage to DNA, and suppression of cell proliferation [25].\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1412 9 of 12\nThe addition of HANP to the GIC has shown good results [10,11,21,22,25,26]. However, it is extremely important to be careful with the manipulation technique during the incorporation of HANP into the material, since improper mixing can affect its properties such as mechanical resistance [10]. Thus, the microstructural analysis of the GIC associated to NP as well as the observation of the distribution and dispersion of the same, is fundamental. From this form, three forms of manipulation of the HANP + RMGIC were defined (Table 1). This study used SEM-FEG, which is widely used for the investigation of the surface microstructures of materials, also making possible the chemical analysis of the sample under observation [22]. In addition, this analytical method provides precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and preservation of the sample. In all experimental groups, regardless of the technique of concentration or manipulation of the HANP, good distribution and dispersion of it was observed in the RMGIC. Due to the size of the nanomaterial, the NP can occupy small spaces, resulting in greater homogeneity of the surface and wide distribution within the material [23]. The control group and the experimental groups with the incorporation of HANP + RMGIC are shown in Figure 1. The interaction of the chemical components of HANP + RMGIC can also be observed by x-ray dispersive energy spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 2, which shows a large amount of phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) in HANP (Figure 2A) compared to RMGIC alone (Figure 2B). After the incorporation of HANP into RMGIC, the chemical components were mixed (Figure 2C). The good distribution of the NPs allows for an increase in the mechanical resistance as it promotes high density and narrowing among the particles within the ionomeric matrix [3]. Gu et al. [10] (2005) observed good distribution and dispersion of NPs within the ionomeric matrix by adding 4% or 12% HA to an encapsulated RMGIC. The authors reported the low tendency to form agglomerates, ensuring uniform distribution of NP and improvement of the mechanical properties of the material. The porosity of the material is also an important property to be evaluated as it is related to the degree of dissolution and, consequently, to the resistance of the restorative material, which can alter its clinical durability. The increase in porosity also results in increased material roughness and greater adhesion of microorganisms [24]. In the present study, it can be seen that all groups incorporated with 10% HANP (A10, V10, and M10), regardless of the mixing mode, presented a number of pores similar to the control, so a viable explanation could be that the GIC liquid was unable to bathe all HANP as they have a larger surface area due to their nanometric size, thus making the connections insufficient to reduce the porosity of the material. A significantly smaller number of pores was found for the other groups compared to the control (Figure 3). Groups V5 or M5 resulted in a smaller number of pores than the number observed in Group C. It is possible that the vortex and the manual technique incorporated less air compared to the technique using the amalgamator; in addition, the 5% concentration of HANP provided better chemical bonds with the GIC, resulting in less pores inside the new material. This comparison can be seen in Figure 5. None of the groups differed from C in relation to the area occupied by the pores (Figure 4). However, a lower value was observed among the groups submitted to the vortex, indicating that, for this mixing technique, smaller pores were formed. This fact is important due to the longevity of the restorations [10,24]. The large number and area occupied by porosities can result in cracks and fractures of the material [10], and these failures can be minimized by the incorporation of 5% HANP with the help of vortex. In addition to the physical and mechanical properties of materials, extreme importance represents cytotoxicity for the viability of a restorative material. Regardless of the incorporation technique, there was an improvement in cell viability directly proportional to the increase in the concentration of HANP (Figure 6).\nNanomaterials 2020, 10, 1412 10 of 12\nSeveral in vitro studies have evaluated the cytotoxicity of conventional and resin-modified GICs and found that the leachable components present in the GIC were responsible for adverse effects on cell culture [8,27,28]. The isolated Vitremer showed higher cytotoxic effects compared to the groups containing HANP (Figure 6). Costa et al. (2003) [28], when evaluating five different GICs, also observed higher Vitremer cytotoxicity in MDPC-23 cells, suggesting that HEMA is the main component that contributes significantly to the cytotoxicity of this material. Thus, the addition of HANP has shown promising results [7,10,11,15]. Pagano et al. (2019) [29] evaluated the addition of 4% HANP to a GIC and observed a significant reduction in the cytotoxicity of the material. The authors reported that this occurrence most likely occurred because HA has excellent biological behavior due to its chemical composition and crystalline structure, similar to apatite in the human skeletal system [15]. GICs are said to have low toxicity of dental pulp in clinical use. These cements exhibit cytotoxicity in the recently established state, but decrease substantially and depend on time [13], as observed in Figures 6 and 7. Additionally, the addition of HANP to RMGIC may have decreased cytotoxicity due to chemical interaction, since HANP has a large amount of calcium and phosphorus (Figure 2). Noorani et al. [30], when analyzing the cytotoxicity of nanohydroxyapatite-silica, found that GIC interacted with HANP through the carboxylate groups in the polyacid [30], which can decrease the cytotoxicity of the material."

    "abstractText" : "Resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) has important properties. However, like other restorative materials, it has limitations such as decreased biocompatibility. The incorporation of nanoparticles (NP) in the RMGIC resulted in improvements in some of its properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical-biological properties of RMGIC with the addition of nanohydroxyapatite (HANP). Material and Methods: Vitremer RMGIC was used, incorporating HANP by amalgamator, vortex and manual techniques, totaling ten experimental groups. The distribution and dispersion of the HANP were evaluated qualitatively by field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM-FEG). The evaluation of image porosity (SEM-FEG) with the help of imageJ. Cell viability 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoline bromide (MTT) and cell morphology analyses were performed on MDPC-23 odontoblastoid cells at 24 and 72 h. Results: It was possible to observe good dispersion and distribution of HANP in the samples in all experimental groups. The incorporation of 5% HANP into the vortex stirred RMGIC resulted in fewer pores. The increase in the concentration of HANP was directly proportional to the decrease in cytotoxicity. Conclusions: It is concluded that the use of a vortex with the incorporation of 5% HANP is the most appropriate mixing technique when considering the smallest number of pores inside the material. A higher concentration of HANP resulted in better cell viability, suggesting that this association is promising for future studies of new restorative materials.",
