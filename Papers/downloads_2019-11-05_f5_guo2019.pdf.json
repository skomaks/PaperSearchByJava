In this paper, Prussian blue (PB) was utilized as precursor for preparation of Fe2O3. The morphology of PB was well tuned by different surfactants and synthesis temperatures, and following with calcination at 550 °C transformed them into Fe2O3 without changing the primary morphologies. The gas sensing properties of these as-prepared Fe2O3 materials were systematically tested. At the optimum operation temperature (200 °C), the sensors based on Fe2O3 nanocubes, nanospheres, and nanoflowers can detect H2S at ppb-level with low cross-sensitivity and excellent long-term stability. Experimental results reveal that the nanospheres based sensor have the best sensing performance, which follows the order nanospheres> nanocubes> nanoflowers. The results demonstrate that it is effective to improve the properties of metal oxide based gas sensor through morphology control by metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-templated route."

      "text" : "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), originated from combustion of coal mines, sewage plants, fossil energy and decomposition of organic compounds, is a colorless and toxic gas, and could lead to death [1–3]. Human nose can smell out H2S odor at a relatively low concentration (˜130 ppb), but the olfactory sensation could be damaged and lost the sense of smell after a long-time exposure at low concentration or short time exposure at high concentration. Medical research indicates that H2S could be quickly absorbed by lung and further induced respiratory system disease, following lose conscious and other serious disease. Hence, the Scientific Advisory Board on Toxic Air Pollutants recommended that the acceptable atmospheric level of H2S for humans should be in the range of 100 ppb [4]. In the meantime, H2S is also a biological mediator gas and plays an important role in disease diagnosis [5]. For example, exhale breath with high concentration of H2S (˜250 ppb) may indicate the presence of periodontal disease [6]. Therefore, developing ppb-level detectable, high selectivity H2S sensors at ambient atmosphere is vital to life security, disease diagnosis and indoor air quality monitoring.\nMetal oxide semiconductors (MOSs), such as ZnO [7], BaTiO3 [8], Fe2O3 [9], WO3 [10], NiO [11] and so on, have been widely studied and applied for H2S detection due to the abundant resources, low cost, relative facile fabrication and high performance. Among them, Fe2O3 has\nbecome a rising star for H2S detection owning to its chemical characteristics and environment-friendly. However, the drawbacks of Fe2O3 are also obvious, such as poor selectivity, insufficient detection limit and high working temperature. Therefore, lots of efforts have been formulated to overcome these drawbacks in order to incorporate highperformance gas sensors, for example heterojunction [12], noble metal doping [13,14]. And morphology-controlling was reported with significantly enhanced gas-sensing properties [15,16]. So it is highly desirable to design and fabricate Fe2O3 nanomaterials with different morphologies via various routes, such as nanoparticles [17], nanospheres [18] and nanochains [19]. Unfortunately, prime Fe2O3 nanomaterials shown unsatisfied H2S detection limit and sensitivity due to its catalytic sites lost caused by the complex and cost synthesis process.\nMetal organic frameworks (MOFs) are composed of nodes (metal ions or cluster) and struts (organic ligands) [20,21]. During the annealing process, the organic part can be easily thermally decomposed into small gas molecules such H2O, CO, CO2 and others, and the metal ion will react with the oxygen leading to the formation of porous nanostructure but basically maintain the original structure [22]. For the past few years, MOFs have been proved to be ideal template for fabricating MOSs with fascinating properties. Owning to the innumerable reaction site, porosity and easy accessibility, MOFs derived MOSs are widely investigated for potential applications in various fields, such as\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2019.04.027 Received 16 July 2018; Received in revised form 21 March 2019; Accepted 7 April 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author.

For gas sensing applications, MOFs derived MOSs based gas sensors have been reported. For instance, Lu and coworkers successfully synthesized porous Co3O4 concave nanocubes as ethanol gas sensor simply by calcining Co-MOF (ZIF-67) [30]. The asprepared Co3O4 shows high sensitivity to ethanol and the detection limit is 10 ppm. Wang et al. transformed Fe(Ⅲ) MOF-5 into ZnO/ ZnFe2O4 hollow nanocubes by annealing in air with acetone detection limit of 1 ppm [31]. So far, a number of MOSs have been synthesized though MOFs route with specific morphology, such as Cu2O/CuO [28], ZnO/ZnCo2O4 [32], and etc.\nIn this work, Prussian blue (PB) was utilized to fabricate high performance H2S sensor. The PB precursors with different morphologies were transformed to Fe2O3 nanomaterials via a simple calcination route. Gas sensor based on the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanomaterials exhibit excellent H2S selectivity and sensitivity. Gas sensing measurements also indicate that morphology of the PB precursors has significant influence on the H2S sensing performance of the Fe2O3 nanomaterials."

      "text" : "The crystal structures of the three as-prepared PB precursors were characterized by XRD. The XRD pattern shows in Fig. 1d displays that all the diffraction peaks of these as-prepared samples match well with standard structure of Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3 (JCPDS NO. 73-0687). No other additional peaks were detected, which verifies the high crystalline\npurity of the as-prepared precursor. The XRD diffraction patterns of the three calcined samples are shown in Fig. 2d. The sharp diffraction peaks of each sample are well-matched to the Fe2O3 (JCPDS NO. 33-0664) and no sign for other phase were observed, indicating that the precursors were successfully transformed into Fe2O3.\nThe SEM images of PB (Fig. 1a–c) confirm that we successfully synthesized three different morphologies, including nanocubes, nanospheres, and nanoflowers precursor. The sizes of these materials were measured to be about 150 nm, 200 nm, 500 nm, respectively. It also reveals that the PB nanocubes and nanospheres were highly uniform. As shown in Fig. 1c, the SEM images reveal that the obtained PB samples have flower-like nanostructures. These nanoflowers consist of interconnected nanosheets.\nThe morphology of calcined samples was checked by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2a–c after calcining the samples can maintain the previous morphology and the size was slightly changed. The SEM (Fig. 2a) and TEM (Fig. 3a and b) images of calcined PB nanocubes confirmed that the morphology was well maintained and the average size was about 100 nm. Fig. 2b shows the SEM image of calcined nanospheres, the morphology can basically maintain in spheres. As shown in Fig. 3c and d those nanospheres has highly uniform size about 100 nm. The morphology and hierarchical structure of nanoflowers are presented in Figs. 2c and 3 e, f. SEM images show that the obtain samples are hierarchical Fe2O3 and their size are range from 500 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 2c). It clearly shows that the nanoflowers still constructed samples numerous interconnected nanosheets."

      "text" : "It is essential to find out an optimal operating temperature for the as-prepared nanomaterials. In this experiment, the temperature resolution is 25 °C and the optimum means highest sensitivity. Fig. 4 shows the responses of the Fe2O3 nanocubes, nanospheres and nanoflowers sensors to 5 ppm H2S at various working temperatures (150–250 °C). The results indicate that the sensor response of the gas sensors vary with the working temperature and present a “volcano” tendency. All sensor materials have the highest responses for 200 °C\nwith this precision. Interestingly, the sensor exhibits significant morphology dependence where the sensor response of the Fe2O3 nanospheres and nanocubes are 2.4 and 1.4 times higher than that of the Fe2O3 nanoflowers. Compared to the sensors based on nanocubes and nanoflowers, the sensor based on nanospheres shows enhanced response to H2S, which can be attributed to the unique hierarchical morphology. Even so, the test result shows that all the as-prepared materials have good response to H2S, showing that the MOFs' route is appropriate.\nGood selectivity to a specific gas is one of the vital properties for\nsensor practical application. SO2 and NO2, which are commonly coexisted with H2S in the operating environment, probable have cross sensitivity. In order to evaluate the selectivity of the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanomaterials, potential interfering gases such as SO2, NO2, acetone, ammonia, humidity and etc. were investigated. As shown in Fig. 5a, the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanomaterials showed distinct high response to H2S than other exposure gases. It is worthy noticing that the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanomaterials exhibited little responses to CH4, H2 and CO. Among those examined interfering gases, although NO2 seems has potential interference to the H2S sensing. Fig. 5b shows the responses to 5 ppm H2S under different relative humidity (RH) as interference. The responses of nanocubes, nanospheres and nanoflowers only slightly\nchanged when changing RH from 10% to 90%, which means the effects of the changes in humidity on the gas sensor responses are small. It is worth noticing that in medical applications, where analyte concentrations are small and the humidity is saturated, and the cross sensitivity to humidity can be critical. However, 90% RH gives a signal change of 1.1 in the range of 20–100 ppb, meaning (for nanospheres) a concentration change of 3 ppb. Fig. 5c shows the responses to different relative humidity (RH) as interference with no exposure to H2S. It can be seen that with the increasing of humidity, resistance did not change too much. Compare with the responses to 5 ppm H2S, the responses to the humidity is significantly lower. Hence, the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanomaterials present good selectivity to H2S. The effect of the humidity on the material stability can be seen in Fig. 5d (and Fig. S1), which demonstrated that the humidity has limited effect on the materials stability.\nFig. 6a depicts the sensing performance of the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanomaterials under low concentration H2S (20 ppb–200 ppb). The responses of nanocubes, nanospheres, nanoflowers to 200 ppb were 2.04, 4.59, and 1.92, respectively. The results indicate that the nanospheres show enhanced response to H2S at ppb-level, compared to the other two. Noteworthy, all of the three materials have distinguishable responses at 20 ppb (1.10, 1.20, and 1.13, respectively). The fitting data of the response of nanocubes, nanospheres, nanoflowers toward low H2S concentration were shown in Fig. 6c. Moreover, to evaluate the sensor ability to continuously monitor the H2S concentration at ppblevel, we also conducted a test with successive increase of the H2S concentration (20–200 ppb) without recovering periods (Fig. 6a). The dynamic performance of the sensors based on nanocubes, nanospheres and nanoflowers for H2S concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 ppm at 200 °C is shown in Fig. 6b. The calibration curves of the H2S sensors in the high concentration range is shown in Fig. 6d.\nFor practical application to a qualified sensor, excellent sensitivity and selectivity is necessary, but good repeatability is important too. As\nshown in Fig. 7, the repeatability of three as-prepared materials was investigated by exposing to H2S gas at 5 ppm H2S for five times. The responses are almost changeless without obvious increase or decrease. The results indicates that these materials performance well in repeatability. Furthermore, the sensor possessing nanospheres morphology has the best repeatability.\nGood long-term stability makes a gas sensor more reliable in practical application. Fig. 8 represents the responses of the three as-prepared materials to 5 ppm H2S at optimum temperature for 90 days. For nanocubes, nanospheres, nanoflowers, the decrease of response were 3.9%, 3.3%, 4.9%, respectively. The results indicating pretty good functional stability and further confirm that the present sensors might have practical application.\nA comparison between the recent reported Fe2O3 based H2S sensors performance and our work is summarized in Table1. It can be found that the proposed three different morphologies Fe2O3 sensor exhibited improved response, high selectivity, and lowest detection limit. Above all, the excellent sensing properties in ppb-level makes nanospheres based sensor a valuable materials for ppb-level H2S gas detection."

The sensors based on nanospheres exhibited highest response to H2S, about 1.5 and 2.5 times to nanocubes and nanospheres, respectively. Compared with previous works on Fe2O3 based H2S gas sensor, the three kinds of sensors show good selectivity, repeatability and long term-stability, and their ability to detect H2S gas at ppb-level. In addition, the presented strategy here could be exploited as a general method to improve MOF-derived MOSs gas sensor performance."

In this paper, Prussian blue (PB) was utilized as precursor for preparation of Fe2O3. The morphology of PB was well tuned by different surfactants and synthesis temperatures, and following with calcination at 550 °C transformed them into Fe2O3 without changing the primary morphologies. The gas sensing properties of these as-prepared Fe2O3 materials were systematically tested. At the optimum operation temperature (200 °C), the sensors based on Fe2O3 nanocubes, nanospheres, and nanoflowers can detect H2S at ppb-level with low cross-sensitivity and excellent long-term stability. Experimental results reveal that the nanospheres based sensor have the best sensing performance, which follows the order nanospheres> nanocubes> nanoflowers. The results demonstrate that it is effective to improve the properties of metal oxide based gas sensor through morphology control by metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-templated route.",
