Ju et al. / Nano T\nntroduction\nCancer is one of leading causes of death in the world and many fforts from different research fields have been made to explore he strategies to cure the cancer with high efficiency and low toxcity [1]. Nanomaterials (including liposomes, metallic particles, olymers, micelles etc.) have drawn a great deal of interest in caner treatment due to their various exciting possibilities in cancer iagnose and therapy.\nBecause of the large surface area or interior empty volume, anomaterials can serve as carriers to delivery large amount of rugs through chemical conjugation or loading, which could solve he problems of free drugs, including poor stability and solubilty, rapid metabolism and clearance, and uptake unselectively by ealthy cells. Progress has been made when using several nanoparicles (NPs) as drug carriers currently approved in preclinical and linical trial [2,3]. Besides, nanomaterials relying on their intrinsic roperties can be triggered by external stimuli and utilized in therpy. External stimuli, such as light [4], magnetic field [5,6], radiation 7], ultrasound [8], and temperature [9], have also been exploited to rigger nanomaterials, which has the advantages of spatial and temoral control for applications such as photodynamic therapy [10], yperthermal therapy [11], radiotherapy [12], or drug delivery and elease [13]. Such as radio-induced tumor cell killing of hafnium xide NPs have been demonstrated in mouse models during Phase\nclinical trial [14]. Except the external stimuli, the properties of tumor microen-\nironment are unique from normal tissues, which also can be onsidered to engineer nanomaterials. Tumor blood vessels have eaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage compared with ormal parts, which is known as the enhanced permeability and etention (EPR) effect [15]. Nanomaterials with small sizes between 0–200 nm can show increasing accumulation in tumor sites, hich is called as passive targeting [16]. However, passive targetng doesn’t work in all types of tumors. Therefore, active targeting, y conjugating biological markers (e.g. folate [17], RGD [18], transerrin [19]) to the surface of NPs, can make sure NPs enter into pecific tumor cells that overexpress specific receptors more effiiently. Besides, the pH value of tumor environment is lower and he reduction potential is different. Enzymes like matrix metalloroteinase are overexpressed in the environment of tumors [20]. hese internal properties can trigger functional nanomaterials to elease drugs or improve the tumor cell internalization of nanomaerials specifically.\nWhen nano-system enter into the changeable and complicated umor microenvironment, imaging techniques could be helpful for isualization of the treatment process. During the development of iological imaging techniques, imaging probe or contrast agent is ntroduced to improve its sensitivity and detectability in the image isibility. Without the contrast agent, images would be limited and nable to provide such rich information [21]. Fortunately, there are ome nanomaterials can act as both therapeutic agents and imagng contrast agents, which means they can achieve imaging-guided ancer therapy, which enables to visualize the size and location f tumors before therapy and evaluate the treatment efficiency uring and after therapy. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resnance imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (CT), positron mission tomography (PET) and ultrasound are utilized for clinical iagnosis nowadays. Compared to small molecule imaging agents r drugs, nanomaterials can integrate two or more kinds of imagng and therapy agents together, which can overcome the limitation f each imaging technique and get more integral information and ynergetic therapeutic effect in clinic.\nThere are two different approaches to achieving nanoplatforms ith multifunctional abilities for imaging-guided therapy. One is ombining functional moieties (drugs, imaging agents, etc.) into the\n6 (2019) 108–122 109\none single nanoparticle together through encapsulating or conjugating or absorbing the agent to others, while the other is utilizing components with inherent functionalities as imaging and therapy agents, which mostly are derived from inorganic materials, to build inherent multifunctional nanomaterials. In this review, we will focus on the latter approach and propose the concept of inherent inorganic nanomaterial engineering for imaging-guided cancer therapy. We will summary intrinsic functional inorganic components which can be applied for cancer imaging and therapy. Besides, we will focus on the recent reports on the inherent multifunctional inorganic nanoplatforms and their applications in imaging-guided therapy, including magnetic hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, chemodynamic therapy and surgery. The development of intrinsically multifunctional inorganic nanomaterials may open the era of cancer diagnosis and therapy in clinic in the future.\nThe concept of inherent inorganic nanomaterial engineering\nMultifunctional nanoplatform for biomedical imaging and therapy should have various functional properties including imaging agents, therapeutic agents (drugs, proteins and genes), targeting molecule or external/internal triggered agents [22,23]. These functionalities should be incorporated into the one single nanoparticle during the engineering of nanomaterials relying on the careful design plan, which could ensure nanoplatform for imaging and therapy theoretically.\nThere are two approaches for accomplishing the above target. One is combining functional moieties (drug, imaging agents, etc.) into the one single nanoparticle together through encapsulating or conjugating or absorbing the agent to others. Since the available moieties and multiple combination methods (encapsulating, conjugating, adsorbing and so on), it could be convenient and efficient to achieve new nanomaterials. So various multifunctional nanoparticle have been reported following this approach. However, with the increasing complexity of the design of nanomaterials, it could be more and more difficult to accomplish the target since the steps of synthesis and purification should be increased, which means hard for reproducibility and scaling-up. Besides, it is complicated for toxicity studies as multiple moieties and the difficult to guarantee uniformity of each nanoparticle.\nThe other approach is using components with inherent functionalities as imaging and therapy agents to build inherent multifunctional nanomaterials. The advantages of this approach include: (1) decrease the difficulty of the design and simplify the composition of the multifunctional nanomaterials while maintaining the desired properties and following the principles of green chemistry, (2) monitor the location of the nanomaterials and the therapy process rely on imaging techniques since different functional components are merged together in each nanoparticle and have no separation problem, (3) have high-usage of the chemicals and possess lower clinical translation hurdles because NPs are uniform and have all functional components from the reaction system, which means much easier toxicity studies.\nTherefore, the materials that possess intrinsically multifunctional capabilities are urgently needed to be exploited as the building blocks for the design. The intrinsic materials are categorized into organic and inorganic. Organic NPs including dendrimers, polymeric micelles and liposomes are conventionally used as carriers and delivery systems [24–31]. In this manuscript, we will focus on inorganic nanomaterials with intrinsic imaging and/or therapeutic properties, such as iron oxide NPs for MRI and thermal therapy [32,33], gold nanomaterials for CT, radiation therapy and photothermal therapy [34–36], carbon-based NPs [37,38],\n110 Y.

Table 1 summarizes inorganic components with intrinsic maging and therapeutic properties, which could be the guide for ynthesizing multifunctional inorganic nanomaterials.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, according to the morphology and compoent of the inherent nanomaterials, they could be divided into\nission tomography; SPECT: single photon emission computed tomography; PAI: emodynamic therapy.\nmonocomponent single block, core@shell heterostructure, dimer heterostructure, and multicomponent heterostructure. The multicomponent hybrid nanoparticle often possess different surface properties, crystal lattices, redox potentials or surface charge, so successful combination of intrinsic multifunctional components into a hybrid nanoparticle still need to achieve suitable synthetic methods [81,82].\nSeed-mediated growth is the most common method to obtain multicomponent hybrid nanoparticle through sequential nucleation and growth of a second or more components on the performed seeds. To achieve the hybrid nanoparticle nucleation, the lattice spacing between two components should be well-matched. The charge transfer between the seeds and newly nucleated components should also be considered since they will change the energy for heterogeneous nucleation. Meanwhile, seed-to-precursor ratio, reactant concentration and heating profile should be regulated to ensure the formation of multicomponent heterostructures [83]. These inorganic nanomaterials should be able to disperse in water and keep stability, which is the first step for their further biomedical application. They could be modificated by polymer (polyvinyl acetate (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan), inorganic materials (silicon dioxide, gold), and small molecule which could have strong coordination capability of group with NPs [84].\nFor example, Sun’s group achieved Fe3O4@Au NPs by reducing HAuCl4 to form Au and further coating on the surface of Fe3O4 NPs in oleylamine. And Fe3O4@Au NPs in an organic environment could be transferred into water with cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) [85]. Our group synthesized Janus-like Au-Fe2C heterostructures by reducing Fe(CO)5 on the seed of Au to form Au-Fe heterostructures, which were further carbonized in octadecene to get Au-Fe2C heterostructures. The heterostructures were modificated by 1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG-NH2) and showed excellent biomedical stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, cell culture medium, and cell culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [86].\nFollowing the design plan, suitable components could be the candidate to synthesize heterostructures. For example, we synthe-\nY.

Reprinted with perm\nized iron carbide NPs and found they had the potential as agents or MRI/PA-guided photothermal therapy with no systematic side ffects [87]. Based on this exciting results, we tried to further optiize their performance as triple-modal imaging agents with high\nhotothermal transduction efficiency. We chose optical classical aterial Au as the seed and got monodispersed Au-Fe2C janus NPs, hich can both provide more accurate information for diagnosis nd ablate tumors for therapy. And we studied the toxicity of Aue2C easily owing to their homogenous structures (Fig. 2) [86]. owever, we cannot choose and combine functional components andomly to obtain multicomponent inherent NPs since many facors influence the synthesis process as we mentioned above.\nonventional imaging techniques\nNowadays, there are broadly two categories of imaging modalties in clinic: primarily anatomical imaging techniques with high patial resolution, MRI, CT and ultrasound (US) imaging, the thers are primarily molecular imaging techniques, which can etect molecular and cellular changes of tissues, including nuclear maging (positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon mission computed tomography (SPECT)), optical imaging [88]. n clinical detection and treatment, all these imaging modalities re irreplaceable accessories for doctors because they have differnt characteristics and suitable for different tissues considering arameters like sensitivity and depth/spatial resolution [89]. The haracteristics of different imaging techniques and corresponding ontrast agents made form nanomaterials will be introduced in this arts. And characteristics of different imaging techniques are also isted in Table 2.\nuided phototherapy agents. (D) Tumor growth curves of mice from the five different from ref. [86]. Copyright © 2017, American Chemical Society.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nMRI, a non-invasive imaging technique, is time-consuming and expensive in clinic. But it can offer high resolution and deep tissue penetration to visualize anatomical details of soft tissue [21,90,91,100]. The basic principle of MRI is based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology and relaxation of the nuclei of proton spins in a strong magnetic field. When exposed to a strong magnetic field, nuclei of proton spins align parallel or antiparallel to the field and precess under a frequency named as Larmor frequency (Fig. 3A). The protons absorb energy and are excited to higher-energy state when the radio-frequency (RF) is introduced to the system. With the disappearance of the RF pulse, the active nuclei relax immediately back to their initial state. There are two kinds of relaxation processes, which can both be utilized in generating MR images to distinguish different types of tissue. One is longitudinal or T1 relaxation that involves the decreased net magnetization (Mz) recovering to the initial state, which is bright in images. The other called transverse or T2 relaxation that refers to the induced magnetization on the perpendicular plane (Mxy) disappearing, which is dark in images (Fig. 3B).\nRelying on the above relaxation pathways, the contrast agents are also classified into T1 and T2 contrast agents to differentiate signal and parameter from MR images in different tissues. The former type is mainly paramagnetic transition and lanthanide metal ions complexes with many unpaired electrons, such as Gd3+, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Fe3+. So NPs with compounds of transition and lanthanide metals could be excellent candidates for T1 MRI contrast agents because of the metal ions with high magnetic moments on their surface [42]. Such as Gd2O3 [43], GdF3 [44] and GdPO4 [45] and MnO NPs [46]. The latter type is based on paramagnetic or superparamagnetic iron\n112 Y.

Ultrasmall\nuperparamagnetic iron oxide NPs with sizes (< 6 nm) were found o be good candidates for T1-weighted MRI [102]. There are several ommercial MRI contrast agents based on iron oxide NPs, such as uch as Feridex, Resovist, and Combidex [103]. And alloy materials, ike CoFe2O4, MnFe2O4, and NiFe2O4, also can be candidates as T2 ontrast agents [21].\nomputed tomography\nCT, one of the leading radiology technologies, is the most onvenient imaging tools used in clinic today considering cost, vailability and efficiency. CT can visualize bone structures clearly ecause of the innate contrast between the more permeable soft\nthe field and precess under Larmor frequency ( 0). (B) After induction of radioef. [21].

However, CT is limited in distinguishing different soft tissues with similar densities because the mechanism of CT to distinguish different tissues is based on different degrees of X-ray attenuation of various tissues [92].\nIn order to provide better contrast in CT images and better depiction of soft tissue structures with similar contrast properties, CT contrast agents are urgently needed in CT techniques. The key factor in selecting CT contrast agents is high atomic number materials. Conventional and present clinical CT contrast agents are based on the high atomic number iodine-based molecules, which are effective in absorbing X-rays but rapid cleared by the kidneys. Larger size of iodine-based contrast agents can address this limitation [47]. Except that, metal NPs such as gold [48], bismuth [49] and tantalum [50], can produce contrast higher than iodine-based agents, which means they have a great potential in CT imaging.\noday 2\nO\ni i n e fl i a fl 1 l l w T i s i [ r s m t r c s\nP\nn i r e t t a i b r S\na 9\nr t w i [ R i\nP\ni t t c l s q p a (\nY. Ju et al. / Nano T\nptical imaging\nOptical imaging is an imaging technique relying on the behavor and properties of ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. Optical maging techniques include bioluminescence imaging, chemilumiescence imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), surface nhanced Raman scattering-based imaging, afterglow imaging and uorescence imaging [104–109]. Among them, fluorescence imagng is the most widely used in clinic, which is based on the bsorption and emission of energy from external light through uorophores. Near-infrared (NIR) light, ranging from 700 nm to 100 nm, is minimally absorbed and penetrate deeper than visible ight in biological tissues. To overcome the photon attenuation and ow penetration caused by the visible region, fluorescent probes\nith long emission at the NIR region have been developed rapidly. he number of NIR probes continues to grow owing to the progress n nanomaterials, such as QDs made from semiconductor NPs posessing optical property [51], various optically active lanthanide ons [52], carbon nanotube with tunable near-infrared emission 53] and gold-based nanostructures with localized surface plasmon esonance (LSPR) [54]. Remarkably, fluorescence imaging in the econd near-infrared window (NIR-II, wavelength 900–1400 nm) is ore desirable than NIR-I imaging (700–900 nm) because of deeper issue penetration, reduced photon scattering and lower autofluoescence. The potential NIR-II fluorescence imaging agents includes arbon nanotubes [93,94], certain types of QDs [95] and several mall-molecule dyes [110].\nET and SPECT imaging\nPET and SPECT are imaging methods based on nuclear magetic resonance (NMR) technology. Despite that both of them can\nmage and quantify the in vivo distribution of positron-emitting adioisotopes injected into the body, they still have some differnces. Firstly, PET has better image resolution and higher precision han SPECT and already is widely used in clinical assessment of umor. PET offers a resolution of 5–7 mm in cardiac tissues while\nSPECT resolution can only achieve 12–15 mm [111]. So PET can dentify biological and anatomical structure which might be hidden y SPECT. Secondly, SPECT can use compounds with two or more adioisotopes to label the biological structure [96,97]. Meanwhile, PECT is much lower-cost than PET in clinical applications.\nCommon PET radionuclides include 18F, 11C, 89Zr, 64Cu, 68Ga, nd 86Y, [55] and common radionuclides used in SPECT include 9mTc, 111In, 67Ga, 123I, 125I, and 131I [56]. The difference between adionuclides of PET and SPECT is half-life of the isotope that each echnique uses. SPECT radionuclides have a relatively long half-life hile short half-life is a limitation of the current PET ones. These sotopes all need to chelate with compounds, such as 11C-raclopride 112], 18F-FDDNP [113], 64Cu-DOPA [114], 99mTc-sestamibi [115]. ecently, researchers use nanocarriers to handle nuclear isotopes n the biological environment [116].\nhotoacoustic imaging\nPhotoacoustic imaging is a hybrid biomedical imaging modalty, which combines the high contrast of optical imaging and he high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging together. Phooacoustic imaging is based on the photoacoustic effect, which an induce tissue heating due to the absorption of non-ionizing aser pulses by biological tissues or exogenous contrast agents and ubsequently produce wideband acoustic waves at megahertz freuencies because of transient thermoelastic expansion [98]. These hotoacoustic waves can be detected by ultrasound transducers t the tissue surface and reconstructed to form ultrasound images\nFig. 3C). Photoacoustic imaging has already been proved as a pow-\n6 (2019) 108–122 113\nerful technique for visualizing biological structures with contrast, penetration depth and spatial resolution, overcoming the limitations of optical imaging or ultrasound imaging only [99].\nExogenous contrast agents can used to enhance photoacoustic imaging except the improvement of instrument. One of the most important factors to design the contrast agents is to assess the ability of converting absorbed light to ultrasound waves. Metal and semiconductor materials possess this function, such as silver, gold, carbon, and QD [57,58]. These structures have great potential in photoacoustic imaging for distinguishing diseased tissue from healthy tissue by reconstructing the composition, shape, and size.\nImaging-guided cancer therapy\nSome nanosystems for delivering therapeutic agents rely on their own special functions including external stimuli and internal tumor characteristics, which could not ensure nanosystem target to tumor sites with high efficiency owing to cancers are heterogeneous and all cancer treatments are only effective for limited cancer types or even at selective cancer stages. Imaging-guided therapy could provide precise disease information as they can visualize the size and location of tumors before therapy and evaluate the treatment efficiency during and after therapy, which means more likely to provide improved prognoses. Here, we will mainly focus on intrinsically multifunctional inorganic nanoplatform with capabilities as therapeutic methods with imaging guidance, including magnetic hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, chemodynamic therapy, surgery and synergistic therapy.\nImaging-guided magnetic hyperthermia\nHyperthermia is a kind of cancer treatment which change the physiology of tumor cells directly and lead to apoptosis finally by exposing tumor sites to high temperatures. Hyperthermia treatment could be divided into three types according to the increased temperature, including diathermia (<41 ◦C), moderate hyperthermia (41 ◦C < T <46 ◦C), thermo ablation (> 46 ◦C). Traditional hyperthermia treatment actually is moderate hyperthermia, which can cure cancer by prompting the immune system or inducing cell death directly by either necrosis or apoptosis, while the normal cells could survive [117]. Hyperthermia treatment heated the whole body is only suitable for treating metastatic cancer that spread over the whole body. Otherwise, the healthy tissues would also be harmed for the long time heating. External devices such as ultrasound, and microwaves that can transfer other energy into thermal energy was applied in the treatment, but they still had a serious threat to the normal tissues. Until Gilchrist et al. first found the heating phenomenon by using -Fe2O3 NPs converting magnetic energy into thermal energy when exposed to an external magnetic field [59]. After that, magnetic NPs have been widely used for hyperthermia, which has been a hotspot to cure cancer because of advantages of localized heating controlled by external magnetic field. Magnetic iron oxide-based hyperthermia passed the preclinical stage and were studied in humans after direct injection of nanoparticles into solid tumors treatment [60,61].\nHysteresis and relaxation behavior are considered as two major factors that explain the reason of heat generated by magnetic NPs under an alternating magnetic field. Hysteresis causes from the internal energy of magnetic NPs and is the main mechanism for ferromagnetic NP-based hyperthermia. Relaxation behavior, including Brown and Néel relaxation way, is suitable for the explanation of superparamagnetic NPs. Brownian relaxation means the rotation of the particles while Néel relaxation refers to the rotation of the moment within each particles. The relaxation process is controlled by the faster one. However, when NPs enter into intra-\n114 Y.

It has been proved that the magnetic hyperthermia efficiency ould be increased with improvement of field amplitude and freuency. The impacts of nanoparticles are much more complicated ecause properties like diameter, magnetization, anisotropy, and omogeneity, can all affect the efficiency of heat generation [20]. herefore, only when taking the structure, morphology, and size f magnetic NPs into consideration could high heat efficiency be chieved. Specific power adsorption rate (SAR) can represent the eating potential of different particles under different conditions. hen comparing SAR values, field strength and frequency should e taken into consideration because SAR value is proportional to he field strength and frequency [118]. Begin-Colin et al. compared AR values of different morphology of ferrite NPs (monodomain, ubes, chains and clusters) and showed a wide range from 81\ng−1 to 2452 Wg-1, which means the importance of regulating the anoparticle morphology for magnetic hyperthermia application 119]. Interestingly, iron oxide nanocubes with different sizes range etween 13 and 40 nm have different SAR values, and nanocubes ith diameter of 19 nm have the highest values SAR values in linical conditions and show efficient hyperthermia performance\nFig. 4) [120].\nHyperthermia accompanied by imaging techniques can improve he therapy efficiency and avoid harm to normal tissues because maging guidance can display the targeted tumor sites and distinuish from normal tissues. Iron oxide NPs are the most common aterials for hyperthermia. Many reports have demonstrated that ron oxide NPs can be the agents for MR imaging and hyperthermia 121]. Therefore, various efforts have been made to optimize the eating efficiency of iron oxide NPs. Iron oxide-based nanomateials, such as core-shell nanostructures [122], multicore NPs [123] nd nanocubes [120], were reported to generate efficient magnetic eating. Some other elements are also merged into iron oxide NP as omponents of heterostrctures to improve their performance. For xample, Gd0.02Fe2.98O4 NPs showed the improved hyperthermia ffects with higher SAR value and ability as MRI contrast agents 124]. -MnxFe2-xO3 NPs seemed to be promising candidates for\nwith edge lengths of (A) 12 ± 1 nm, (B) 19 ± 3 nm, (C) 25 ± 4 nm, and (D) 38 ± 9 nm. es for four kinds of IONCs.

Wilhelm et al. reported that iron oxide nanocubes with an average diameter of 20 nm can achieve heating efficiency at clinical doses (0.25 M) and acceptable irradiation (0.3 W/cm2) under both an alternating magnetic field and NIR laser irradiation, which can then overcome the main disadvantages iron oxide nanoparticlebased magnetic hyperthermia or photothermia only (Fig. 5) [5]. Small-size iron oxide NPs can be used as gate in mesoporous materials to control drug release when applying an external stimuli, which can provide on-command feature with precise control [126]. Hu et al. constructed drug delivery system on mesoporous iron oxide NPs with payload of gas-generated perfluorohexane, which can simultaneously perform on-demand gas generation and drug release under high-frequency magnetic field [126]. Thermoresponsive copolymer coated with mesoporous silica NPs and iron oxide can trigger drug release for chemotherapy, along with hyperthermia and MRI [127].\nBased on these examples, imaging-guided hyperthermia have great promise in cancer theranostics.\nImaging-guided photothermal therapy\nExcept magnetic-induced hyperthermia, light can also be used to product heat in cancer treatment, which is called photothermal therapy (PTT). This method is a promising cancer treatment that might eventually utilized in clinic since it can be controlled spatiotemporally to reduce their side effects. However, it also has obvious shortcomings. Firstly, it is only suitable for superficial tumors because of the limited capability of penetration in biological body. Secondly, the healthy tissue adjacent to tumor cells can be damaged because of light absorption and then lead to reduction of therapeutic effects. Luckily, nanomaterials with capability of light-activated heating can achieve high temperature in tumor sites with lower intensity of laser irradiation and no damage to surrounding healthy tissue owing to their tumor targeting properties. Moreover, the penetration depth of photothermal effect could be improved when using NIR or even longer laser wavelengths, which have lower absorption by healthy tissues, could improve the\nY.

Therefore, nanomaterials applied in PTT hould have properties including large absorption cross-section of ptical wavelengths, biocompatibility and low toxicity. There have een various materials employed for PTT, including noble metalased nanomaterials [62,63], carbon-based nanomaterials [4,64], rganic materials [128,129] and others [65,130].\nNoble metal -based nanomaterials, using localized surface plason resonance (LSPR) to absorb and covert light to vibrational\neat energy, have emerged as the leading PTT platform because hey have facile surface functionalization for conjugating ligands o achieve targeting ability or passivating agents to improve bioompatibility. Meanwhile, their optical properties can be regulated y controlling their structural morphology and integrating other lements to form heterostrcutures so that they can absorb light aximally and penetrate deeply in tumor sites. For example, gold anostructures with absorption peaks located in the NIR regions, uch as gold nanorods, nanostars and nanocages, have shown xcellent efficiency for tumor ablation with NIR light irradiation, hich highlights their promise in clinic and promote the further evelopment of PTT [131–134]. Zhang et al. synthesized thermoreponsive polymer encapsulated gold nanorods which can transfer nergy from NIR laser to heat, which can almost completely inhibted tumor growth and lung metastasis [131].

They exhibited excellent photothermal performance with photothermal conversion efficiency value achieving 39.45% under 808 nm and 75.27% under 1064 nm laser irradiation. What’s more, they could achieve photoacoustic imaging-guided PTT in the NIR-II region with capability of degradation and metabolizability (Fig. 6) [135].\nExcept noble metal-based nanomaterials, other kinds of nanomaterials can also show the ability of photothermal effect with imaging functions. Carbon NPs with sp2 domain rich such as carbon nanotubes and graphene are well known as photothermal converting NPs. For example, Robinson et al. reported reduced graphene oxide sheets with average 20 nm lateral dimension and high NIR light absorbance potential exhibited high photothermal efficiency. [136] In addition, copper-based chalcogenides, Pd nanosheets and even organic particles are good candidate for imaging-guided PTT. Such as ultrasmall CuCo2S4 nanocrystals with size of 10 nm were synthesized and showed high photothermal performance with photothermal conversion efficiency up to 73.4% and capability for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and infrared thermal imaging.

However, the penetration depth of light largely ampered the clinical applications for visualized cancer therapy. eanwhile, unpredictable physiological damages in the microenironment also limit their further translation in clinic.\nmaging-guided photodynamic therapy\nApart from killing tumor cells by heating, light has been reported o produce oxygen in the process of light induced therapy. Phoodynamic therapy (PDT), combining light, photosensitizer and xygen together, can cause direct damage on cancer cells which re exposed to light. Because photosensitizers could transfer the ptical energy to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), ncluding hydroxyl radicals (•OH), singlet oxygen (1O2) and superxide (•O2−), then tumor cells could be killed through cellular poptosis or necrosis by breaking the threshold of cell [142]. The verproduction of ROS will only happen in particular cells with nternalization of the photosensitizer and laser irradiation. Thereore, PDT has great promising potential in clinical cancer treatment ith reduced side effects.\nDuring the PDT procedures, imaging is necessary as guidance to ake sure the localization of the photosensitizer (PS). PSs such as\norphyrin, phthalocyanines and bacteriochlorin derivatives have een demonstrated the capabilities in cancer theranostics. Some\n(G) Fluorescence images of tumor-bearing mouse at 48 h after intravenous injection al infrared images after 5 min laser irradiation of 1064 nm of tumor-bearing mouse pyright © 2018, The Royal Society of Chemistry.\nof them even have been approved for clinical use [143]. However, they are limited by their photobleaching, poor biocompatibility and inability to be absorbed in NIR region, which has been hampered by penetration depth [144]. So, NIR light induced nanophotosensitizers are urgently needed and highlight the promise for cancer imaging-guided PDT treatment. Ideal photodyanmic agents should only show efficacy under light exposure with minimal dark toxicity.\nIn order to integrate photodynamic therapy and imaging, it is needed to synthesize NIR-light absorbed photosensitive nanomaterials. Semiconductor QDs could show better photostability and biocompatibility than organic PSs. Ge et al. reported that graphene QDs exhibit good 1O2 generation capability and could be applied in simultaneous imaging and cancer treatment [66]. However, QDs have disadvantages in terms of cytotoxicity and ROS generation efficiency compared with organic PSs. Therefore, modifying semiconductor QDs with traditional PDT agents have been developed in imaging-guided PDT and to reduce the cytotoxicity of QDs [67]. Meanwhile, gold-based nanomaterials with photosensitive agents could show multiple abilities in imaging and therapy. Vesicular assemblies of gold NPs encapsulating PS Chlorine6 (Ce6) could enable NIR fluorescence/thermal/photoacoustic imaging-guided synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy (Fig. 7) [36].\nInterestingly, Chen et al. developed gadoliniumencapsulated graphene carbon NPs (Gd@GCNs) which could work as both imaging probes and PSs. The nanoparticle-based PS showed high 1O2 quantum yield, strong fluorescence and high T1 relaxiv-\nY.

In vivo experiments demonstrated the otential of the Gd@GCNs to work in the image-guided PDT for ancer treatment [68]. This work paves the way for develop of ntrinsic PSs and shows that Gd@GCNs possess unique physical, harmaceutical, and toxicological properties and are an all-in-one anotheranostic tool with substantial clinical translation potential.\nPDT has been applied in oncology for more than 30 years, howver, it is only being used in the superficial treatment and cannot eplace the traditional therapy. The fundamental problem lies in heir chemical and physical properties lacking of biological abilities nd the inability of PDT to treat solid and deep tumors. Conjugation f the photosensitizers to moieties might solve the present diffiulties. And imaging–guided PDT can provide PDT direct guidance, hich will ensure a promising future role in cancer treatment.\nmaging-guided chemodynamic therapy\nChemodynamic therapy (CDT), a new kind of therapeutic stratgy, is defined as the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide H2O2) into ·OH, the most harmful ROS, in tumor sites through enton reaction or Fenton-like reaction, which can be catalyzed y ferrous ions (Fe2+), iron-based nanomaterials, other metalased nanomaterials (Mn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+) and graphene oxide 145–148]. The TME has many distant characteristics than normal issues, including lower pH values, overexpressed enzymes, H2O2 verproduction and hypoxia. These properties have already been tilized by many research to design smart nanoplatform, which can e triggered or controlled by TME, such as pH-stimuli drug delivery anocarriers. Compared with the above cancer treatments which eed to be triggered by external stimuli, CDT can be achieved by onverting endogenous chemical energy into ROS and then induce ell death. Thus, CDT can break through the limitations of the pentration of light in therapy relying on laser irradiation, and avoid arm to normal tissue since the free radical can only be produced n TME. However, the amount of H2O2 in tumor sites is limited and overxpressed glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells could scavenge highly eactive ·OH, thereby intrinsic catalytic efficiency is unsatisfactory nd the CDT efficacy is diminished [149]. Hence, it is necessary o utilize suitable nanomaterials to improve the CDT efficiency by\nection of GV-Ce6. (C) Thermal images of tumor-bearing mice exposed to laser for e6, in which yellow circles indicate the injected location of tumor. Reprinted with\nutilizing catalytic effect of exogenous ferrous ions. Various ironbased nanomaterials have been reported as CDT agents because they can dissolve Fe2+ under the mildly acidic conditions in TME and then trigger the Fenton reaction to generate ·OH inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor cells. Zhang et al. reported the facile synthesized amorphous iron NPs can achieve highly specific CDT with MRI guiding [69]. Wang et al. developed iron engineered mesoporous silica NPs (rFeOx-MSNs) which can also be used for in situ Fenton-like reaction to produce ·OH and cause oxidative damages to tumor cells because they can degrade into Fe2+. Meanwhile, rFeOx-MSNs could be collapsed under protein-rich tissue environments because of the strong coordination between ion and proteins and then accelerate the degradation speed of iron to enhance the CDT efficacy. In addition, rFeOx-MSNs showed T2-MRI performance for imaging because of the coexistence of Fe2+ and Fe3+, which means they can achieve for imaging-guided CDT [70]. In addition, M(Mn, Sn, Zn)Fe2O4, reduced iron metal-organic framework NPs and FeO(OH)n have also been demonstrated as CDT agents [71–73,150].\nBeside, other nanomaterials containing transition metal ions such as Mn2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ could also act as catalytic ions [73–76]. Lin et al. reported MnO2 coated mesoporous silica (MS@MnO2) NPs could release Mn2+ in acidic environment and trigger Fentonlike activity to generate ·OH to kill tumor cells. More interestingly, Mn2+ yield also accompany the consuming intracellular antioxidant GSH to glutathione disulfide (GSSG), which could improve the CDT efficiency because GSH depletion made antioxidant defense system (ADS) of broken and the tumor cells more susceptible to highly toxic ·OH. Meanwhile, MS@MnO2 NPs can be used as GSHresponsive MRI contrast agents and drug delivery systems, owing to the dissociation of MnO2 shell to Mn2+ with higher T1 relaxivity and controlling drug release under GSH stimuli. Therefore, MS@MnO2 NPs had great potential to achieve imaging-guided chemodynamic therapeutic process (Fig. 8) [76].\nExcept using catalytic effect of nanomaterials, some strategies modulating of the reaction environment can also be used to optimizing the effect of CDT, like reduced pH levels, increased amounts of reactants and reduced amounts of glutathione [151–153]. Besides, exogenous energy like light, heat or magnetic fields, are also are desirable to promote the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions [146,154]. For example, since upconversion NPs showed the ability\n118 Y.

More importantly, CDT can combine with ther therapeutic treatments synthetically to destroy tumor more fficiently, having potential for clinical translation.\nmaging-guided surgery\nOncologic surgery is one of the traditional cancer treatments nd is the most common part of treatment procedure for over 80% ancer patients. Surgery is the only curative choice for patients ith solid tumors. It is necessary for surgeon to discriminate caner with healthy tissue accurately during operation so that they an remove tumor cells precisely with minimal damage to normal issues like nerves to maintain quality of life of patients. Imaginguided surgery is one of the main methods for distinction in clinic. efore surgery, surgeon always make the specific operation plan ely on overall diagnosis results of the patient, especially imaging esults which could provide the information about location, size nd shape of tumor. However, as we have mentioned above, each maging technique we use currently has their limitations, which\nay bring danger during the operation, and the most parts of these linical imaging techniques cannot be utilized intraoperatively. esides, it is very hard for surgeon to resect all tumor tissues of the atient by naked eyes because of indistinct margin between tumor nd normal tissues, increasing the possibility of cancer recrudesence. Therefore, it has becoming urgent requirement to develop ontrast agent for imaging-guided surgery to achieve extremely recise discrimination and resection of tumor tissues.\nOptical imaging is the most direct and promising strategies o highlight cancerous cells intraoperatively and detect tumor\nargin with high sensitivity and specificity.

At present, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) applied in hepatic micrometastases detection and sentinel lymph node mapping [77,78]. However, ICG is limited by the lack of precise targeting. In order to enable imaging agents with selectivity, fluorescent dyes can be conjugated with targeting moieties such as antibodies, peptides and sugars, which are overexpressed and accumulated in tumor sites [79].\nBesides, self-illuminating NPs in the NIR region, such as QDs and carbon nanotubes, could represent another promising source for imaging-guided surgery therapy. Compared to conventional fluorescent dyes, QDs could show stronger signal and have longer fluorescence lifetime [155]. Gao et al. designed CdSe@ZnS QDs with 650 nm emission wavelength modificated by PEG and active targeting antibody. Owing to the specific optical property of QDs, illumination signal was obtained in the tumor sites after 2 h intravenous injection [156]. Carbon nanotubes have intrinsic fluorescent emission in the NIR-II window and show deeper penetration with lower influence from autofluorescene [157].\nSurgeon can also rely on other optical imaging techniques to distinct margin between tumor and normal tissues and resect tumor tissues of patient. Kircher et al. reported a unique triple-modal MRIPAI-Raman imaging NPs with 60-nm gold core covered with the Raman molecular tag trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene and further protected by a 30-nm silica coating, which can be used to guide surgeon to resect the brain tumors accurately in living mice, in which MRI can provide information for surgery planning preoperatively and Raman signal can visualize the tumor margin intraoperatively [80]. This probe could make neurosurgeons to ’see’ tumor margin accurately before and during surgery, thus allowing for completely brain tumor resection according to Raman signals and subsequent histological analysis of sections (Fig. 9)\nAlthough imaging-guided surgery have promising applications in clinic, there are still many existing problems that need to be solved, such as the long blood circulation of nanoagents are needed for clinical preoperation plans, and imaging techniques should improve spatial resolution to provide more distinct information during surgery. With those problems solved, imaging-guided surgery will have great potential in cancer imaging and therapy.\nY.

Therefore, the development of maging-guided synergistic therapy is highly desirable for cancer reatment.\nThe combination of photothermal and chemotherapy could lead o enhanced destruction of cancer cells synergistically. Besides, he heat of photothermal effect could also trigger the system o release drug and achieve imaging-guided combination therpy [132,158,159]. Cheng et al. demonstrated a new nanosystem uilt on the integration of Au nanocages as carrier and phototheral agents, and lauric acid, which was a phase-change material ith melting point around 43 ◦C. Then selenous acid, an attractive hemotherapeutic agent, could be loaded into the cavities of Au anocages. When applying NIR laser irradiation to the nanosystem, hotothermal agents melted the lauric acid and triggered the rapid elease of selenous acid [160]. This study inspires us to actively ontrol the nanoplatform as the therapeutic agents according to heir intrinsic properties, which will pave the way for personalized\nedicine. Radiation therapy (RT) utilizes ionizing radiation to generate\nxygen radicals and attack cancer cells. However, high-energy adiation including X-ray and -ray may cause severe damages to ormal tissues when killing cancer cells. And the hypoxic TME make umor cells more resistant to ionizing radiation and finally the failre of RT [161,162]. MnSe@Bi2Se3 nanostructures were fabricated or MR and CT imaging-guided synergistic photothermal therapy nd radiotherapy. In this system, the MnSe core offers T1- and T2eighted MRI contrast agents, whereas Bi2Se3 shell endows the bility for CT imaging, enhanced RT and PTT. The NPs showed strong ynergistic effect in vivo resulting from the remarkably increased xygenation during PTT and enhancement of RT efficacy for effecive cancer killing [163]. This work also demonstrates a promise trategy to enhance RT efficiency and the great advantages of synrgistic therapy.\nIn addition, synergistic therapeutic effect of PDT and PTT ave also been demonstrated compared to PTT or PDT alone\n164,165].

There are two different approaches to get these multifunctional NPs. One approach is combining multiple functional moieties together through encapsulating or conjugating or absorbing the agent to others, which increasing the complexity of nanomaterials. So this approach is hard for reproducibility, toxicity biodegradation and studies. The other one is what we focus on that engineering nanomaterials possessing intrinsically multifunctional capabilities, most of which are inorganic components with specific imaging and therapeutic abilities. This approach has great advantages in reproducibility and scale-up owing to the much simplified synthesis. These inherent functional components could be used to form core@shell heterostructure, dimer heterostructure, and multicomponent heterostructure, which could break the limitation of single component and then have wider application in imaging-guided therapy.\nOwing to the imaging visualization and diagnosis, the therapeutic plan could be designed more accurately before surgery. And the treatment efficiency could also be evaluated during and re-examined after therapy. Finally, the cooperative imaging and therapeutic agents have the capability of killing cancer with minimal side effects. Therefore, with these nanomaterials, the normal cancer treatments in clinic, including diagnosis, therapy and re-examination, could be integrated into a simplified personal treatment and decrease the side effect and the cost for patients.\nHowever, considerable efforts should be devoted continually to new methods synthesizing uniform heterostruture with intrinsically different functional components and new materials that are intrinsically multifunctional. And we cannot choose and combine functional components randomly to obtain multicomponent inherent NPs since many factors influence the synthesis process, including lattice spacing between two components, charge transfer between the seeds and newly nucleated components, seed-toprecursor ratio, reactant concentration and heating profile as we mentioned above.\n1 oday 2\nt a F f s i h p a s s s r b r 1 c a b t t a c F I c m p a n l t o u f\nt o W a r e f\nA\nF r 5 ( s o\nR\n20 Y.

So nanomaterials should be uitably modificated to ensure they can disperse and keep stable n water. It is worth mentioning that natural materials from the uman body are safer than synthetic materials for clinical puroses [167–169]. Secondly, in vivo targeting efficacy of imaging gents is very important. Sufficient amounts of imaging agents hould be accumulated in the target tumor sites in order to obtain uccessful results in imaging and therapy. According to previous tudies, the metabolism processes in vivo of nanomaterial is quite elated with their sizes. NPs with sizes larger than 100 nm would e accumulated in liver and spleen owing to the capture of the eticuloendothelial system (RES), while NPs with sizes smaller than 0 nm will be easily cleared by the kidney during the systemic cirulation. Therefore, those with sizes around 10–100 nm would have dvantages in nanomedicine because they may have favourable ehavior of biodistribution, accumulation and clearance. Thirdly, oxicity studies of the nanomaterials need to be addressed before hey can be used in clinic. The physicochemical properties of NPs re essential to be optimized during the design, and therefore they an show favorable biodistribution with minimal RES elimination. inally, metabolism of nanomaterials should be studied furtherly. t would not be better that nanomaterials could be degraded into learable components and elimination from body. However, nanoaterials which cannot be degraded or removed by the body, have otential to harm the human bodies as they would be captured nd accumulated by the RES. Moreover, the metabolic pathway of anomaterials is still not completely understood at the molecuar level, so many studies should be performed before we could otally control the behavior of nanomaterials. It would be a good pportunity to accelerate product entry into clinical practice when sing FDA approved components to engineering inherent multiunctional nanomaterials.\nThe continued development of such intrinsically multifuncional inorganic nanomaterials is increasingly important and will pen the era of cancer diagnosis and therapy in clinic in the future. e believe that these nanomaterials will help us to achieve personlized medicine since they could be synthesized according to our equest and plan. Cancer patients may have opportunity for recovry from fatal disease and finally come into optimistic outlook in uture.\ncknowledgements\nThis work was financially supported by the Natural Science oundation Beijing of Municipality (L172008), the National Natual Science Foundation of China (51672010, 81421004, 51631001, 1590882, 51602285), the National Key R&D Program of China 2017YFA0206301, 2016YFA0200102).
