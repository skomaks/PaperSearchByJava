The micro-cone structure is formed via laser ablation, and then the nano-pyramid structure is electrodeposited on the micro-cone structure, resulting in a hierarchical structure that is important for achieving super-hydrophobicity on an intrinsically hydrophilic material surface. In this study, the surface morphology and material removal mechanism are discussed with respect to the laser-ablated surface and the subsequent electropolished/ electrodeposited surfaces. The condensation experiments results show that both types of surfaces are associated with relatively high contact angles (CAs) at normal temperatures, and the CAs are 147° and 160°, respectively. However, the CA on the laser-ablated surfaces at low temperatures decreases to as less as 107°, which may be owing to the easy transition from Cassie state to a metastable state or even the Wenzel state, leading to a degraded hydrophobic surface. By contrast, the CA on the sequentially processed surfaces still maintains at 150°, which should be attributed to the densely distributed nano-scale structures. The sequentially processed surfaces also show excellent long-term durability. Furthermore, this technique has been employed for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces with CAs > 151° and the sliding angles (SAs) < 8° on the inclined surfaces with the inclination angle α < 30°. Overall, the technique presented in this study supply a practical and reliable method for realizing the stable Cassie state and hence super-hydrophobicity on metallic surfaces."

      "text" : "In the nature, super-hydrophobic surfaces can be found in various animals and plants, including leeches, lotus and the aquatic fern Salvinia molesta [1–4]. Water droplets roll easily on these surfaces as the contact angles (CAs) exceed 150° and the corresponding sliding angles (SAs) are< 10°, which yields unique properties such as being waterrepellent [5], self-cleaning [6–8] and anti-icing [9]. Therefore, bionic methods for processing super-hydrophobic surfaces have attracted much attention, among which picosecond laser texturing of metal surfaces has drawn an enormous amount of research interest due to its advantages of high precision, limited thermal damage, controllability and low pollution [10,11]. However, roughening a metal surface with a laser makes it more hydrophilic because metals are intrinsically hydrophilic materials and have high-surface-energy. To reduce the surface energy after laser irradiation, a layer of low-surface-energy material is usually introduced via chemical modification [12–14]. However, chemically modified layers are usually associated with poor thermal and\nmechanical stability and are easily damaged in harsh environments. In addition, they affect the inherent properties of metals, such as the surface conductivity and reflectivity [15]. Therefore, techniques are desired to introduce hydrophobic surfaces without the need of chemical modification.\nIn the past few years, many studies were conducted on processing metals without chemical modification. Bhattacharya et al. [16] were the first to report roughness-induced hydrophobicity of a metallic surface with hydrophobic clustered Cu nano-wires, in which low-surfaceenergy materials were not involved. Specifically, a ‘two-scale’ roughness surface was made by depositing Cu-nano-wire arrays through porous anodic Al and the following vacuum-dried step. In addition, Kwon et al. [17] used nano-second laser ablation (LA) combined with insulation and electrodeposition to fabricate a micro-pillar array with a re-entrant structure of Cu on stainless steel, for which the water CA was up to 153°. Recently, Yang et al. [18] prepared the superhydrophobic surface with the CA of 153° and the SA of 5.5° on the Al surface without chemical modification via nanosecond laser ablation.

Although some papers regarding different methods used for fabricating metallic superhydrophobic surfaces without chemical modification, a practical and efficient processing method for mechanical stable superhydrophobic surface with Cassie-state stability at low temperature and suitable for most metals is relatively limited.\nHerein, we fabricated biomimetic super-hydrophobic metal surfaces using different methods, i.e. LA and a sequential processing (LA, electropolishing and electrodeposition). The mechanism for micro-nano hierarchical structure formation was analysed and the condensation experiments were conducted to compare the hydrophobicity and Cassie-state stability of the LA and sequentially processed surfaces. After the analysis of the condensation mechanism, the durability of the sequentially processed surface was analysed by aging experiments. In addition, the sequential processing technique was applied on the inclined surfaces on which we successfully fabricated a super-hydrophobic layer containing micro-nano hierarchical structures."

      "text" : "The experimental device to prepare the hierarchical micro-nano structures comprised an ultra-fast picosecond laser system for the micro-structures and an electropolishing and electrodeposition system for the nano-structures, as shown in Fig. 1(a). A schematic of the overall sequential processing is shown in Fig. 1(b), including arranging the scanning path, LA, electropolishing and electrodeposition. The sample was a 99.9 wt% Cu plate (15×15×1mm3). Before the picosecond LA,\nthe sample was roughly polished using abrasive SiC papers with grit size of 1500, followed by fine polishing using alumina powder of 2.5 μm in diameter. In this experiment, micro-scale Cu structures were produced by means of picosecond LA using an EdgeWave (PX100-1-GM) system with a wavelength of 1064 nm and a pulse length of 13 ps. The laser repetition rate was 1MHz and the output power was 19.8W, resulting in a single laser pulse energy of 19.8 μJ and fluence of 6.3 J/ cm2. The scanning speed was 200mm/s, and the scanning interval was 20 μm or 30 μm, corresponding to the laser scanning repetition times of 10 for the horizontal surface and 15 for the inclined surface, respectively. Via an x-y scanning galvanometer and an F-θ lens, the focused laser beam scanned on the Cu surface in a pattern of cross lines in atmospheric environment. When micro-structures were ablated on an inclined surface, an angle-adjustable pad was used to control the sample gradient as shown in Fig. 1(a). After LA, the sample was cleaned ultrasonically in acetone for 20min and then electropolished for 60 s at 25mA/cm2 in a solution containing 70 g/L Na2CO3, 10 g/L KOH and 10 g/L C12H25NaO4S, in which the sample was used as the anode with a lead block as the cathode. After that the sample was activated in 10 wt % HCl at room temperature for 40 s and then washed immediately in distilled water. Finally, the Cu sample was placed in the electrodeposition bath as the cathode and a Ni block was added as the anode. The bath compositions included 238 g/L NiCl2·6H2O as an ion source, 30 g/L H3BO3 as a pH buffer and 200 g/L C2H10Cl2N2 as a crystal modifier. Furthermore, the Ni block dissolved continuously to maintain the Ni2+ ion concentration. The electrodeposition solution was kept at 60 °C and pH=3.8. During electropolishing and electrodeposition, a UNI-T (UTG4082A) galvanostat was used to provide DC power and an\noscilloscope was used to detect the current in the loop. The optimised operating conditions for the laser processing, electropolishing and electrodeposition parameters are given in Table 1.\nThe micro-nano hierarchical structures, surface morphologies and surface profiles were analysed via a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL, JSM-7800F, Japan) and a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning microscope (VK-X250, Keyence, Japan). The water CA of each sample surface was measured with 5 μL water droplets and a video-based optical contact-angle measuring device (Data Physics, DCAT 11, Germany) in a closed room with relative humidity of 50% and constant temperature at 25 °C. The SAs of water droplets on the samples were evaluated using the tilting plate method. Cooling the sample temperature to 5 °C within 5min, then the CAs and the SAs were recorded. Each CA and SA value reported herein was the mean of five measurements made at different locations on the sample surface."

      "text" : "To compare the surface morphologies of the micro-nano hierarchical structures progressively formed by the techniques used in this study, three types of structures were prepared according to the processing sequence, namely Structure-1 (LA), Structure-2 (LA and electropolishing) and Structure-3 (LA, electropolishing and electrodeposition).\nThe sample with the periodic micro-nano structures shown in the top row of Fig. 2 (i.e. Structure-1) was fabricated by LA only. The period of these micro-cones is 20 μm and their average height is 26.6 μm [Fig. 3(c)]. Fig. 2(a1) shows the micro-cone array and a single cone. Surrounding the Cu micro-cones are ripples that are roughly 3 μm wide, and the whole cone has a structure that is similar to a ladder. These ripples are covered with only a few nano-foam particles, as shown in Fig. 2(a2).\nThe third type of micro-nano structure (i.e. Structure-3), as shown in the bottom row of Fig. 2, is a hierarchical micro-nano structure processed by LA, electropolishing and electrodeposition. The microstructures on those samples are the same as those on Structures 1 and 2 [with a period of 20 μm and an average height of 26.3 μm, Fig. 3(d)]. The ripples are retained on the micro-cones as shown in Fig. 2(c1) and (c2); however, the ripple surfaces are now covered fully by dense nanoscale structures, namely, the nano-pyramids [Fig. 2(c2)], which have an average size of 800 nm in height and 400 nm in full width at half maximum. The growth direction of the pyramids is approximately perpendicular to the micro-cone surface. In addition, irregular small pyramids (with heights ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometres) are dispersed on the surface of the large pyramids and ripples as shown in Fig. 2(c2). The sequential processing methods produce surfaces that contain micro-, submicro-, and nano-structures. Although their microcones are similar, the nano-structures of the sequentially processed surfaces are much denser than those of the laser-textured surfaces. Comparing their 3D height maps and profiles on a nano-scale, Structure-3 is clearly rougher than Structure-1 (Fig. 3)."

      "text" : "The three types of structures represent the basic forms due to the methods of (i) picosecond LA, (ii) LA followed by electropolishing and (iii) sequential processing. The structural morphologies and topographies are related to the LA, electropolishing and electrodeposition parameters and can be modulated accurately over a wide range. Since our focus herein is the super-hydrophobicity and Cassie-state stability of laser-treated and sequentially processed surfaces at low temperatures (T=5 °C), we only briefly discuss the mechanisms behind these structures formation.\nAlthough it is difficult to prepare well-defined nano-scale structures with picosecond LA, it remains a useful method for processing microstructures, which can be obtained efficiently by adjusting the laser parameters rationally [19]. When a laser is ablating, its temperature exceeds the melting temperature of the material, but it is below the boiling point. The material particles then evaporate and dissipate, which can be used for laser surface texturing [20]. In our experiments, the amount of material removed was related to the laser fluence, scanning speed and number of scans. The amount of material removed could be increased by either increasing the laser fluence and number of scans or decreasing the laser scanning speed. The energy intensity profile of the picosecond laser beam used in the experiment was a Gaussian energy distribution, and the diameter of the laser spot (1/e2 of maximum intensity) [21] was roughly 20 μm. When the interval between adjacent laser scanning lines approaches the laser spot diameter, the material surface tends to form periodic micron-scale structures whose period is similar to the interval between adjacent laser scanning lines [22]. Therefore, the scanning intervals that we used for the samples were 20 μm for a horizontal plane and 30 μm for an inclined plane (Table 1).\nThe ripples surrounding the micro-cones are due to multiple reflections of the laser beam [20]. When the laser is focused on the material, a V-shaped groove forms because the laser intensity profile is Gaussian. While a small such groove is fabricated, the incident beam angle on the V-shape is large. Therefore, the incident laser beam is reflected from the V-shaped surface, whereupon a large amount of laser power is reflected and irradiated into the V-shaped groove. The laser energy that enters the groove ablates the material therein, thereby forming surrounding ripples as shown in Fig. 2(a2).\nDuring ultra-fast laser texturing, different laser-material interaction mechanisms (e.g. material ablation, plasma plume formation, particle dissipation and re-deposition) play different roles in preparing micronano structures [23–25]. Irradiating a material surface with high laser fluence may cause material ablation and the trigger plasma formation containing laser-induced highly energetic species including atoms, clusters and particles, some of which can dissipate into free space having been driven by the high initial kinetic energy obtained when they were ejected from the material surface. However, some lose their initial kinetic energy before they can dissipate, being re-deposited back on the material surface by the action of gravity and atmospheric pressure. The nano-particles re-deposited on the micro-structures are the nano-foams distributed on the surfaces of micro-cones as shown in Fig. 2(a2). In these experiments, to improve the micro-protrusion\nprocessing precision and efficiency, a laser fluence of 6.3 J/cm2 and a scanning speed of 200mm/s were chosen. According to Long's research [22], when dense nano-foams are deposited on a material surface, the processing efficiency is reduced to<10%. Therefore, sequential processing is a more effective method.\nBefore electrodeposition, the electropolishing and activation treatments were required to remove the nano-foams and clusters that have deposited on the micro-cone surfaces of the substrate, making them smooth as shown in Fig. 2(b2). The activation treatment can also enhance the bonding strength between the subsequent Ni pyramids and substrates.\nThe electrodeposition was conducted in two stages as described in Table 1. The electrodeposition time and current density significantly affect the size of the Ni pyramids [26], indicating that their morphology can be controlled easily. According to Khorsand's [27] research, an increase in the deposition time increases the volume and number of pyramids, but increasing the current density decreases their size. This behaviour is attributed to the evolution of more hydrogen at the cathode surface at higher current density [28,29]. The hydrogen changes the growth interface of Ni atoms on the cathode by affecting the surface energy and growth mechanisms, thereby helping ultimately to deposit smaller grains on the substrate surface. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2(c2), the submicro-pyramids (> 100 nm) are covered with smaller nano-pyramids (< 100 nm). In addition, the surface morphology of the Ni pyramids is greatly affected by crystal modifier\n(C2H10Cl2N2), which is considered to dynamically control the growth rate of different Ni crystal planes by adsorption and desorption interaction with these planes [30]."

      "heading" : "3.3. Condensation experiment",
      "text" : "Before the condensation experiments, the samples fabricated by LA and sequential processing had to be stored in air for two weeks for them to transform from super-hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic. That change in wettability is due to the change of the chemical composition of substrate surface. Geng et al. [31] found that when Ni was exposed to air for 15 days, its surface oxidised to form NiO, which is naturally hydrophobic, and the formation of NiO film reduces the surface energy of the sample. Moreover, the Cu sample was transformed to super-hydrophilic CuO during laser ablating, which converted into hydrophobic Cu2O after being exposed to air for two weeks at room temperature [32–34]. In addition, the change in wettability was also related to the adsorption of carbon-containing organic compounds from the air [35–38].\nFig. 4 shows the CAs and SAs of Structures 1 and 3 change with respect to temperature. Structures 1 and 3 both show high hydrophobicity at room temperature (25 °C). The CAs of Structures 1 and 3 are 147° and 160°, and the SAs are 17.5° and 1.1°, respectively. Although the water droplet on the surface of Structure-3 is more rounded than on the surface of structure-1, they all exhibit spherical shapes. This\nshows that both have good hydrophobicity at room temperature. Although the hydrophobicity of Structure-3 is better than that of Structure-1, both can be considered to be in the Cassie state [39,40]. However, these surfaces exhibit great differences in wettability at low temperatures (T=5 °C); the samples were cooled to 5 °C and the sealed space was maintained at 5 °C. The water droplet on Structure-1 does not exhibit a completely spherical shape and it invades the surface structure, meaning that it transits from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state. By contrast, the water droplet on the Structure-3 surface remains approximately a spherical shape. In this case, even the CA of Structures-3 decreases to 150° and the SA increases to 8.9°, while the CA of Structures-1 decreases to as less as 107° and the water droplet firmly sticks onto the Structures-1 surface (SA is 90°). In addition, when removing samples out of the constant temperature and humidity chamber, the\nsurfaces of Structures 1 and 3 bore films of condensed water. The film on the Structure-3 surface disappeared rapidly, whereas that on the Structure-1 surface dissipated slowly.\nThese results indicate that surfaces mainly comprising microstructures prepared by LA can be approximately super-hydrophobic at room temperature, whereas they are unstable during condensation. In this case, the water droplets in contact with the surface are in either the Wenzel state or the metastable Cassie state. When the surfaces of the Cu micro-cones are covered with Ni submicro- and nano-pyramids, superhydrophobicity can be achieved at room temperature (with a CA of 160°). Although the CA reduces slightly at 5 °C (to 150°), the surface remains super-hydrophobic. This can be related to the Ni submicro- and nano-pyramids as the dense submicro- and nano-structures cause the Structure-3 surface to retain its super-hydrophobicity even at low\ntemperature (T=5 °C). After measurement, the CA of a smooth Ni surface is similar to that of a smooth Cu surface, namely 79° and 76°, respectively; both are inherently hydrophilic materials. Therefore, we reason that the super-hydrophobicity is controlled by the surface micronano structures and is independent of the chemical nature of Ni. Long et al. [22] also found densely distributed nano-structures to be important for maintaining the stable Cassie state at low temperature. Water droplets on micro-structures surfaces contact the substrates with high solid-liquid area fractions. Because the condensed droplets grow to a certain extent on the micro-structures, they combine with neighboring droplets to form the liquid film that fills the micro-structures, thereby initiating the formation of Wenzel droplets. It results in a high adhesion of the microstructure surface to the water droplets [41,42]. When the external water droplets contact the surface, they partially contact the surface-condensed water film, resulting in the adhesion of the droplets as well as an unstable hydrophobic surface. The super-hydrophobicity stability of the micro-nano hierarchical structures (Structure-3) improves somewhat under condensation, but it cannot prevent the transition from a Cassie state to a metastable state or a Wenzel state. The samples with micro-nano hierarchical structures maintain high CAs and low SAs even under low temperatures. The water droplets condense into a large number of tiny water droplets because of the so-called coalescence-induced droplet jumping phenomenon caused by dense Ni nano-structures [22,43,44], which contribute to the Structure-3 surface to improve the stability of the Cassie-state under condensation. Most droplets grow slowly during condensation, while some condensed water droplets coalesce on the low-adhesion nanostructure surface [45], during which the droplets have been observed jump away from the surface. Cheng et al. [46] has proven that the nano-structures roughness is important for droplets jumping. With abundant nanostructures, condensed droplets tend to contact the substrate with low solid-liquid area fractions, which decreases the adhesive force between the droplets and the samples and hence help maintain the Cassie state. As a result, when external droplets contact and roll down along the surface, the previously condensed tiny droplets may be taken away effectively. Thereby, the dissipation rate of the condensed water film is also related to the hierarchical structures. For Structure-1, the large water droplets are filled with the sample mainly composed of micro-structures, which cause the water film to evaporate relatively slowly. However, for Structure-3, because there are only tiny water droplets forming on the densely distributed micro-nano structures surface, the water film evaporates quickly in air. In summary, the dense nano- pyramids help to restrain the growing of condensed water droplets, which helps the surface remain in the Cassie state even under low temperatures."

      "text" : "In order to be practically applied in daily life, super-hydrophobic surfaces must possess good durability. The long-term durability of structure-3 is measured by placing the samples in the air for different time. The results are shown in Fig. 5. After 8months, Structure-3 still maintains excellent super-hydrophobicity, with the water CA maintaining larger than 158° and SA smaller than 4°. In fact, according to the research of Rajab et al. [47], such super-hydrophobicity can be maintained as long as two years after fabrication. When the sample surface is slightly abraded or impacted, the nano-pyramids at the top of the micro-cone are almost worn off, while the Ni-pyramids on the sidewall are not affected due to the protection of the microstructures, thus leading to good durability [48]. From the analysis above, it could be concluded that on the micro-nano hierarchical structures of Structure-3, the deep and ordered micro-cones provide protection for submicro- and nano-pyramids and thus guarantee the durability."

      "heading" : "3.5. Application to inclined plane",
      "text" : "Based on the excellent super-hydrophobicity and stability of the\nsequential processing method on a horizontal plane, we now study the morphology and hydrophobic properties of that process on inclined substrates, that is, the incident laser is not normal to the substrate. To show the difference in surface nano-structures clearly, the scanning interval is set as 30 μm.\nWith a substrate inclination angle of 5°, we refer to the surface fabricated by LA as structure-4 and that fabricated by sequential processing as structure-5. The processing parameters are given in Table 1. The top row of Fig. 6 shows the morphology and topography of structure-4. The Cu micro-cone array is in order and uniform [Fig. 6(a1)]. Fig. 6(a2) shows the morphology of a single cone, where square B contains a large number of aggregated nano-foam particles whereas square A contains only a few such particles. Moreover, there are almost no nano-particles in the selected white region in Fig. 6(a2).\nAs shown in the schematic of the ablation process in Fig. 7, when the laser ablates the Cu substrate, the ablated Cu atoms form a plasma plume that sprays into the air anisotropically because of the inclination angle α [49]. Nano-particles then form and aggregate and finally deposit on the Cu surface. Because of the angle α, abundant nano-particles are deposited on the B side and can reach farther regions, whereas fewer nano-particles are deposited on the A side (Fig. 7). Therefore, the micro-cone structure presents a side (red square B) with dense nanofoams and a side (red square A) with relatively sparse nano-foams [Fig. 6(a2)]. From our previous research, given that there are relatively few nano-structures, the hydrophobicity is poor in this situation and the CA of structure-4 is 141°. Because the nano-foam is not distributed uniformly, the Cassie state is unstable. However, Structures 4 and 5 have similar micro-structures, with a micro-cone diameter of roughly 30 μm and overall heights of 48.4 μm and 48.9 μm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(a3) and (b3). Because of the subsequent electropolishing and electrodeposition, a large number of nano-pyramids are deposited on the surface of the micro-cone array; these are densely and uniformly distributed, as shown in Fig. 6(b2). In this situation, the CA of structure-5 is 157°. In addition, comparing Structure-5 to Structure-4, according to the condensation experiments, the Cassie state is stable. The results also prove the significant role of the abundant nano-pyramids in achieving the super-hydrophobicity.\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the CAs and the SAs of surfaces prepared with the two methods have been measured when the inclination angle α is changed from 0° to 30°. It is clearly illustrated that the CAs decrease and the SAs increase with an increase in α. The CA of sequential processed surface is slowly reduced to 151° and SA increases slightly from 1° to 8°, while CA of laser ablated surface decreases to 136° and SA increases from 19° to larger than 44°.For a fixed scanning interval L (30 μm here), the actual interval L1 (L1= L/cosα) of the sample surface increases\nwith α, thereby reducing the hydrophobicity [50]. However, for α < 30°, the surface of micro-nano hierarchical structures prepared by sequential processing exhibits super-hydrophobicity; in contrast, the LA samples do not exhibit super-hydrophobicity. Applying this sequential preparation to an inclined plane, comparing to laser-only ablation, expands its application."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusion",
      "text" : "A sequential fabrication technology has been proposed for bionic super-hydrophobic metallic surfaces via picosecond LA, electropolishing and electrodeposition. Using this technology, super-hydrophobic surfaces with micro-nano hierarchical structures were prepared successfully. The most significant advantages and conclusions of sequential processing technique can be summarized as following:\n(1) Compared with a surface prepared by LA, a sequentially processed surface is covered with densely distributed nano-pyramids. (2) The condensation experiments showed that the sequentially processed surface is associated with better hydrophobicity and Cassie-\nstate stability compared with the LA surface at low temperatures (T=5 °C), as CA larger than 150° and SA<9° have been achieved. The densely distributed nano-pyramids are beneficial to the condensed water droplets refinement and jumping, as well as reduce the adhesion with the surface, enabling to maintain the stable Cassie state. (3) The sequentially processed surface shows outstanding long-term durability, maintaining super-hydrophobic after being placed in the air for 8months. The extended durability is attributed to the protection effect of deep and ordered micro-Cu-cones on the nano-Nipyramids. (4) Studying sequential fabrication on an inclined surface indicated that stable-Cassie-state hydrophobic surfaces can be achieved when the inclination angle is< 30°. Such surfaces still exhibit superior hydrophobicity compared with LA surfaces, although the CAs decrease as the inclination angles α increase.\nBeing maskless, controllable and flexible, this promising sequential processing technique can be used to fabricate various types of micronano structures on almost any metal. Furthermore, because of their excellent thermal and electrical properties, super-hydrophobic surfaces processed by this technology without modification using low-surfaceenergy materials are expected to gain wider industrial application."

    "abstractText" : "The fabrication of a bionic super-hydrophobic metallic surface without any low-surface-energy modification is investigated, in which picosecond laser ablation, electropolishing and electrodeposition are used sequentially. The micro-cone structure is formed via laser ablation, and then the nano-pyramid structure is electrodeposited on the micro-cone structure, resulting in a hierarchical structure that is important for achieving super-hydrophobicity on an intrinsically hydrophilic material surface. In this study, the surface morphology and material removal mechanism are discussed with respect to the laser-ablated surface and the subsequent electropolished/ electrodeposited surfaces. The condensation experiments results show that both types of surfaces are associated with relatively high contact angles (CAs) at normal temperatures, and the CAs are 147° and 160°, respectively. However, the CA on the laser-ablated surfaces at low temperatures decreases to as less as 107°, which may be owing to the easy transition from Cassie state to a metastable state or even the Wenzel state, leading to a degraded hydrophobic surface. By contrast, the CA on the sequentially processed surfaces still maintains at 150°, which should be attributed to the densely distributed nano-scale structures. The sequentially processed surfaces also show excellent long-term durability. Furthermore, this technique has been employed for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces with CAs > 151° and the sliding angles (SAs) < 8° on the inclined surfaces with the inclination angle α < 30°. Overall, the technique presented in this study supply a practical and reliable method for realizing the stable Cassie state and hence super-hydrophobicity on metallic surfaces.",
