      "text" : "Physcion (PHY), chemically knows as, 1,8-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-6methyl-9,10-anthracenedione [1], is an anthraquinone derivative, yellow crystalline compound [2] and widely available in the nature and can be extracted from earth and marine resources [3,4]. The major sources of Physcion are (not only limited to) Polygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) [2], Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PMT) [5], lichen [6], Rhamnus [7] etc. Several biological activities of PHY, including hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial activities, and anticancer have been reported previously [8–11]. Miscellaneous antibiotics inhibit various pathogens [12], but the reduction in their efficacies are challenging. Owing to the decrement in the effectiveness of first-line antibiotics, the Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming the increasing health management issue of the world. Likewise, the increasing resistance to various drugs developed by numerous pathogens [13] towards current antibiotics demands further research in advancement and creation of new antimicrobials [14]. The pathogens in humans have developed manifold resistance to drugs because of commonly using undifferentiating commercial antibiotics for treating\ncontagious diseases [15]. This scenario had attracted the researchers to study and discover the further advanced novel chemotherapeutic antibacterial agents from several resources. Compared to plant derivative drugs, the production cost of synthetic medicines and their severe side effects are alarming [16]. Although, significant efforts have been invested for pharmacological and chemical analysis on marine, plant and fungal resources but there is still great prospective in nature for discovery of drugs, particularly anti-pathogenic compounds [17]. More specifically, due to hydrophobic and poor biocompatibility of PHY, its systematic study is necessary to be formulated and an effective method for absorption of drug into nano-carriers should be developed. In this study, we used MOFs as drug carrier with simple technique because of their crystalline porous structure, adjustable pore sizes and functionalities along with large surface area [18,19]. Moreover, their facile synthesis and non-toxic nature make them attractive candidates as drug carrying vehicles. Recently, MOFs are also being utilized in biomedical sciences [20], especially as drug delivery agents [21]. In the same way, one of the most attractive feature of MOFs is its involvement in making of drug delivery system, which has potential to improve the drug effectiveness by controlling its release precisely at the target location\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.110364 Received 8 April 2019; Received in revised form 6 July 2019; Accepted 13 July 2019\n⁎ Corresponding author at: State Key Laboratory of Chemical Resource Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beisanhuan Donglu 15 Hao, Beijing, PR China.\nE-mail address: lianghao@mail.buct.edu.cn (H. Liang).\nColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces 182 (2019) 110364\nAvailable online 15 July 2019 0927-7765/ © 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.\nT\n[22,23]. ZIFs are one of the most promising type of MOFs [24] and have potential to sustain at high thermal and hydrothermal conditions [25]. Likewise, at nano-scale level ZIFs are considered as perfect carriers for loading various drugs [26] that regulate the releasing of small molecules [27] as therapeutic agents [28,29]. Among the ZIFs family, ZIF-8 is very dominant MOF with very high absorbency, increased surface area, moisture consistency, non-toxicity, bioavailability [30] and excellent chemical as well as thermal stability [31]. Owing to the smaller sizes of ZIF-8 frames, these compounds cramped inside the frameworks of ZIF-8, which suppress the premature release. ZIF-8 is highly pH responsive [32] because in physiological conditions it remains stable but decomposes in acidic environment [33]. Owing to such properties, significant usage of ZIF-8 is found in several applications such as catalysis [34,35], gas storage [36], separation [37], chemical sensors etc [38]. For ZIF-8 synthesis, studies have reported various procedures which include microwave [26], solvothermal [39], accelerated aging [40], ultrasound [41], thermochemical [42] etc. The constituents of ZIF-8, 2-methyl imidazolate and zinc ions, are physiological system components [43] in which the imidazole group is essential to histidine (the amino acid) whereas zinc metal is second widely used transition element in biology [44]. The nano-spheres of ZIF-8 can further be functionalized by encapsulating nanoparticles in the spheres [45], modifying the linkers [46] and attaching to surface for marking the drug to different cell inhabitants [47].\nIn this study, encapsulation of natural antimicrobial drug PHY in to ZIF-8 framework was successfully carried out through single step method as shown in (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the natural drug physcion encapsulated in to ZIF-8 using drug delivery system for antimicrobial actions."

Initially, 1 mg of PHY@ZIF8 for each pH was dissolved in 1ml of phosphate buffer saline having tween 80 and then the sealed vial was kept under continuous vibration with 200 rpm at 37 °C. After every, carefully, chosen time intervals, 0.5 ml of solution was taken out through centrifuge and replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh PBS solution.

      "text" : "Physion@ZIF-8 was synthesized according to procedure [50]. 5.0 mg of PHY and 0.46 gm of Zinc nitrate solution was mixed continuously with 1.0 gm of 2-methylimidazole solution. The color of mixture was changed from yellow to milky within 50 s, which clearly indicates the formation of PHY@ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Further, nanoparticles were collected by using magnetic stirrer for 30min and centrifugation. The product was washed with water three times as a control experiment and dried. The sample was dried to determine PHY drug loading encapsulation (DLE) and drug loading capacity (DLC).\nSEM and TEM were used to evaluate the morphologies and sizes of PHY@ZIF-8 and ZIF-8. SEM & TEM studies clearly show that the shape of PHY@ZIF-8 nanoparticles is uniform hexagonal (Fig. 2A and B) which is similar to ZIF-8, as depicted in (Fig. S1A and B). The SEM studies of PHY@ZIF-8 reveals that the average diameter size of particles is about 160.8 ± 10 nm. The UV–vis absorption spectra of free PHY and PHY@ZIF-8 are shown in (Fig. S2). The visible absorption band of free PHY was observed at wavelength of 434 nm [51], but no characteristic absorption band for PHY@ZIF-8 were observed at the same wavelength. However, the absorption band for PHY loaded into ZIF-8 is revealed at wavelength of 215 nm (hypochromic shift) which could be due to encapsulation of PHY within the center of the nanoparticles ZIF8. This is assumed to be the effect of some kind of forces while loading of drug (here PHY into ZIF-8); such forces can be electrostatic interaction, pi-pi interaction and strong hydrogen bonding within the guest and host molecules [52]. Moreover, it was confirmed from the zeta potential value of PHY@ZIF-8 which is around +6.5mV that is very close to the value of ZIF-8 i.e. + 5.5mV. It indicates that PHY was not adsorbed onto the surface of ZIF-8 but absorbed into its framework [53]. The dynamic light scattering was used to study the size distribution of ZIF-8 and PHY@ZIF-8. The results show that the average hydrodynamic diameter size distribution of ZIF-8 is 157 nm (Fig. 3A) which is shorter than PHY@ZIF-8 nanoparticles having size 165 nm\n(Fig. 3B). These small-scale sizes of PHY@ZIF-8 can be helpful in biological activity.\nThe XRD patterns were also obtained for pure Physcion, ZIF-8 and PHY@ZIF-8. The result obtained from XRD pattern for ZIF-8 in which the characteristics peak values 7.46, 10.42, 12.76, 16.44, and 18 can be corresponded to 110, 200, 211, 013, and 222 planes respectively as shown in (Fig. 4A). The position of peak is well matched with already reported literature [54,55]. The results indicate that PHY@ZIF-8 has pure phase ZIF-8 framework [43].\nTGA studies of PHY and PHY@ZIF-8 (NPs) were also carried out. The TGA curve of PHY reflects that a gradual weight loss starts at ˜ 207 °C and gets decomposed about 99% at around 300 °C (Fig. S5). The achieved result of PHY thermal stability is well matched with reported literature [56]. On the other hand, the TGA curve of PHY@ZIF-8 shows the initial weight-loss is at about 135 °C which may be linked to the removal of certain solvent molecules. The occurrence of second weight loss between 260–300 °C can be attributed to the decomposition of Physcion encapsulated in ZIF-8 frame work. The final weight loss starts from about 500 °C which relates to the decomposition of ZIF-8 frameworks. Aforementioned temperature for breakdown of physcion from cavity of ZIF-8 framework shows that the encapsulated PHY into ZIF-8 is thermally stable up to 260 °C. While ZIF-8 is stable round 500 °C [57].\nThe FTIR spectra of PHY shows the band at 3432 cm−1 corresponds to vibration of phenolic group while other bands at 2939-2844, 1675- 1630, 1569-1453, and 1367-1228 cm−1 represents CH3 asymmetric and symmetric, C]O conjugated free and conjugated H-bonded,\naromatic C]C stretching of benzene ring and C–O stretching phenyl in plan respectively (Fig. 4B) [58], [59]. In ZIF-8 spectra, the peaks are observed for Aromatic C–H stretching, aliphatic CeH stretching, CeC stretching and CeN stretching of imidazole at 3174, 2924, 1594 and 1564 cm−1 respectively [60]. Same peaks are observed in PHY@ZIF-8 spectrum with one additional peak at 3419 cm−1 which indicates the blue shifted peak of phenolic group of physcion as depicted in (Fig. 4B). The shortening in band from 3432 to 3419 cm−1 confirms the encapsulation of PHY in ZIF-8 [61]."

      "text" : "The release behavior of PHY from PHY@ZIF-8 was observed in different solutions such as PBS (pH 5.0, 5.4 and 7.4) and tween 80 (0.5%). The in-vitro drug release process was carried out for 72 h on UV–vis spectrometer at wavelength of 434 nm. It was observed that, after 72 h the cumulative release of PHY from ZIF-8 under acidic condition (pH 5 & 5.4) was 88.72% and 81.31% respectively. This can be attributed to the imidazolate protonation in acidic condition during which the coordination linkage breaks between Zinc and imidazolate, resulting in enhanced release of Physcion from ZIF-8. On the other hand, release of PHY from ZIF-8 under physiological environment (pH 7.4) during same time of 72 h was observed to be very slow i.e. 27.61%. It revealed that release behavior of PHY loaded into ZIF-8 under acidic condition is three times more as compared to physiological environment as presented in (Fig. 5) The release of PHY from ZIF-8 under acidic\nconditions was significantly higher which is because of the decomposition of ZIF-8 into the acidic environment. Based on the findings acquired from our results, it is assumed that at physiological pH environment (pH 7.4) PHY release can be controlled and can remain stable in ZIF-8 frameworks; on the contrary more rapid drug release occurs at acidic conditions.\nThe stability of PHY and nanoparticles (NPs) is very important for the evaluation of its biological study. We therefore investigated the stability of PHY@ZIF-8 NPs. In nanoparticles kept for 25 days, neither precipitate was formed nor were size changes observed. It indicates the high stability of PHY@ZIF-8 NPs which was confirmed by DLS in (Fig. 6).\nThe stability of PHY (as a free drug) in different pH solutions at room temperature was studied through UV-spectrometer at wavelength 434 nm. PHY decomposed about 81% in 20mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS 7.4) in 90min while in PBS (pH 5.5), 57% of PHY remained stable even after 90min which depicts that physcion is more stable in acidic condition (Fig. S3A and B). Similar occurrence is also reported by some studies that the Aloin-Emodin (similar to PHY family) is stable at low pH [62]. Furthermore, the stability of PHY was also investigated by adding tween 80 (0.5 wt %) in the phosphate buffer saline solutions. It was observed that after 90 min of incubation at room temperature only\n11% and 3% of PHY was degraded in PBS pH (7.4) tween 80 (0.5 wt %) and in BPS (pH 5.5) tween 80 (0.5 wt %), respectively as shown in (Fig. S4A and B). Henceforth it is established that tween 80 acts important role in stability of PHY in PBS pH 7.4 as well as in pH 5.5, Literature also supports that tween eighty is good solvent as well as good stabilizer [63]."

      "text" : "The antimicrobial activity of PHY, ZIF-8 and PHY@ZIF-8 was assessed through agar well diffusion method in which comparison was made with the standard streptomycin. Accordingly, the samples were categorized as standard, pure (Physcion), ZIF-8 and synthesized (PHYZIF-8), whereas the strains used were Pseudomonas Putida, Escherichia coli, Engineered Escherichia coli (QH4) (Gram negative strains) and staphylococcus aureus (Gam positive+ strain) bacteria. Interestingly, the PHY@ZIF-8 blended material revealed a significant antibacterial activity against all aforementioned strains. The highest inhibition zone against P.Putida was observed to be 13mm in 7.5 μg/60 μl of PHY@ZIF8 whereas it was 9mm in 15 μg/60 μl of pure (PHY). On the other hand, the inhibition zone of ZIF-8 against P. Putida was 10mm at 30 μg/60 μl and for standard (50 μg/50 μl) the maximum inhibition zone was 19mm. For remaining strains, the 30 μg/60 μl concentration was used for PHY, ZIF-8 and PHY@ZIF-8 whereas the concentration of standard remained 50 μg/50 μl. The inhibition zone observed against E. coli, Eng E.coli (QH4) and S. aureus for PHY@ZIF-8 was 23mm, 18mm and 20mm, whereas for Physcion it was in order of 13mm, 10mm & 10mm. Moreover, the inhibition zone of ZIF-8 against these three strains was found to be 14mm, 12mm and 11mm respectively as given in Table 1. Nevertheless, in standard (streptomycin) highest degree of inhibition was noted against E.coli, Eng E.coli (QH4) and S. aureus which was 29mm, 24mm and 20mm respectively.\nThe antibacterial effect of PHY@ ZIF-8 can be due to release of Zn2+ ions with PHY and its binding with stringent attraction to the –SH groups of proteins. The organized and very close cell membranes become disorganized and dispersed, resultantly destroying their intrinsic function and leads to bacterial death [64,65]. The hydrodynamic diameter of PHY@ZIF-8 is 165 nm. The nanoparticles size can perform a significant role in biological activity, smaller the NPs higher the antimicrobial activity. It is because the smaller nanoparticles have larger particular surface areas which may have high probability of being in contact with and can easily pass through the cell wall and membrane as comparison to larger nanoparticles [66,67].\nThe free drug showed less antibacterial activity against all strains as illustrated in Table 1. Although the Physcion possess hydroxyl groups at C1 and C8 which are active against the micro-organisms and may enhance the antibacterial activity but the presence of other groups such as methyl and weakly polar methoxyl which results the weak antibacterial activity of Physcion [68].\nOn the other hand, ZIF-8 possess slightly high antimicrobial activity as compared to free physcion as shown in Table 1. The reason lies in the fact that ZIF-8 comprises of central Zn2+ ions with a positive charge and organic 2-methylimidazole ligand, which supports to interact with the bacterial cell walls [69]. The electrostatic interaction amongst the positively charged ZIF-8 NPs and the negatively charged bacterial cells is observed to be vital for bactericidal efficacy [70]. The microbial activities of Zn2+ composites having derivatives of imidazole ligand, which have been well recognized for above mentioned application [71]. However, according to the findings of our study high inhibition zones against Gram negative (- strains) and Gram positive (+ strain) were found, when the PHY was loaded in to ZIF-8.\nSince PHY@ZIF-8 showed maximum antibacterial activity against microorganisms, so this drug may have potential to treat the diseases pertaining to infections caused by microbes and can be useful in nanomaterial based biomedical applications."

The encapsulation of PHY into ZIF-8 was confirmed by SEM, TEM, PXRD, DLS and FTIR. The high encapsulation efficiency about 88% and drug loading capacity of 11.49% was achieved. After successful encapsulation of PHY, the in vitro drug release experiments were performed. The influence of pH on drug release was studied. The drug release behavior of PHY@ZIF-8 was found to be 3 times higher in acidic (pH 5.0) media than the physiological media of pH 7.4. Likewise, the antibacterial activity of PHY-ZIF 8, was explored by agar well diffusion method and was observed to be much higher against gram negative and gram positive bacteria than free PHY. These results indicate that the PHY encapsulation into ZIF-8 (MOF) is necessary and could be favorable for drug delivery system against various infectious diseases. Considering its potential capabilities, PHY@ZIF-8 can be a new model drug agent in the development of pharmaceuticals and biomedical applications."

The synthesized PHY@ZIF-8 indicated high drug loading encapsulation efficiency i.e. 88%, whereas, drug loading capacity was found to be 11.49%. The characterization of PHY loaded-ZIF 8 (PHY@ZIF-8) was carried out by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and FT-IR methods. The release of PHY loaded in ZIF-8 was 88.72% at pH 5.0 which is approximately three time higher than its release in physiological system with pH 7.4 (27.61%). The remarkable stability of PHY@ZIF-8 NPs even after 25 days stem it as an effective and stable candidate. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of pure PHY, ZIF-8 and PHY@ZIF-8 were investigated against gram negative strains and gram positive strain. The PHY@ZIF-8 showed maximum growth inhibition zones against all microorganism as compare to pure PHY. We hope that this model drug could have the potential ability for treatment of various infectious diseases.",
