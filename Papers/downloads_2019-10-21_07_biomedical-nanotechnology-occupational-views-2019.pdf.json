Peculiar physico-chemical roperties of nano-sized materials have been exploited in several roduction and industrial sectors and are expected to transform iotechnology, medicine and pharmaceutical fields as well. Nanoechnology, in fact, may provide solutions to many of modern\nedicine’s unsolved issues regarding the prevention, diagnois, and treatment of diseases, offering beneficial advantages for ealthcare workers, individual patients, and society in general 2]. However, concerns emerged on the possible adverse impact hat nano-enabled solutions may have on human health, and paricularly on workers exposed throughout the product life-cycle. herefore, this paper focuses on opportunities as well as occuational health and safety risks possibly derived from nanoscale iomedical applications that should be carefully considered to chieve a responsible nanotechnological development.\nano-enabled imaging diagnostics\nNanotechnology may increase the sensitivity and specificity f anatomical and functional imaging, engineering nanomaterials\n∗ Corresponding author at: Department of Public Health, Section of Occupational edicine, University of Naples Federico II, Via S.

In this regard, super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as contrast agents for magnetic resonance. This may support healthcare workers in an early diagnosis, better staging and pathological lesion followup, all of which are important determinants of patients’ healing and/or survival rate. Nanomaterials may also function as attractive theranostic platforms, activated by tumoral physico-chemical stimuli, to provide diagnosis and therapeutic delivery in a single procedure. The current practice of surgical oncology may be radically changed by the intraoperative use of nano-enabled imaging techniques, i.e. near-infrared optically active NMs are under investigation as imaging agents for the precise mapping of surgical margins, cancer-bearing lymph nodes, and remnant disease [3,4].\nNano-sensing\nNano-sensor platforms for biochemical and molecular sensing, as well as for surface discrimination of cancerous cells and infective agents, are investigated for their potential impact on diagnosis, disease monitoring and genetic screening. Nano-robots may characterize a promising area of future nanotechnological development, combining robotic technology and biological knowledge for a theranostic approach in dental, neurosurgical, cardiovascular, and hematological practice. Enhancing traditional analytical based strategies, these devices may ameliorate primary prevention and\nN\nm s t D f i h w f a e a a g t s c p t o s l a j f a p b m\nano-therapeutics and drug delivery systems\nNano-therapeutics and nano-enabled drug delivery systems ay offer easier access to biological barriers, increased solubility, tability and targeted specificity, providing more effective, conrolled, and personalized treatments with fewer side effects [7]. rugs with a crystal size in the submicron range, i.e. sirolimus, enofibrate, aprepitant, and olanzapine are commercially available n US and Europe to treat organ rejection following transplantation, ypercholesterolemia, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, as ell as schizophrenia, respectively (Table 1) [3,6,8]. Nanocrystal ormulations of hydroxyapatite and calcium-phosphate have been pproved by FDA as engineered materials for bone structure regenration. Certain drug-free inorganic NPs, i.e. iron oxide-NPs, are vailable as iron replacement therapies to treat anemia in Europe nd US. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that i.e. silver, old, cerium oxide, zinc oxide-NPs possess anti-microbial properies, although their function as pharmaceutically active compounds till needs clinical confirmation. According to the innovative conept of “caging” vs “killing” cancer, NPs can be formulated to deliver ro-inflammatory/pro-immune molecules against tumor antigens o make the cancer microenvironment inhospitable for growth. Iron xide nanocrystals received FDA and EMA approval, while modified ilica, gold, or lipoprotein NPs, are under investigation as primary ight absorbers for photo-thermal cancer therapy [3,6,9]. Liposomes nd polymeric therapeutics, i.e. polyethylene-glycol-protein conugates, find application in Europe and US as drug nano-carriers or the treatment of cancers, infections, wet macular degeneration, nd pain after major surgery. Other nano-formulations, including olymeric micelles, oil in water emulsions, and inorganic NPs have een investigated for the release of different biologically active olecules [10].\nProviding targeting drug performance, nano-medicines may support simplified treatment regimens, in terms of timing, administration frequency, and dosage, therefore enhancing patient compliance to the treatment plans. This may improve response rate, durable therapy effectiveness, while reducing possible development of drug resistance. Nanotechnology may support advances in the “precision medicine” concept, which relies on “patientcentered” healthcare models, and medical management autonomy [6]. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may achieve unprecedented performance if NM properties are able to accelerate the healing process and prevent the risk of infection in injured tissues, be biocompatible with and support the growth of several tissues, as well as to interface with electrically active ones [11].\nOccupational health and safety concerns\nThe path of nanotechnology in biomedical application should take into account not only the provided public health advantages (Fig. 1), but also occupational health and safety implications for workers who may become exposed to such innovative materials for extended periods of their working life (Table 2) [12,13].\nLaboratory workers involved in the research and synthesis of biomedical nano-products, as well as those employed in preparing, dispensing, and administrating such products in clinical pharmacies, and healthcare delivery settings may all face innovative NM related occupational health risks. Physicians, pharmacy, nursing, as well as shipping, receiving, and maintenance personnel may come into contact with NMs while handling contaminated items, including the disposal of excreta from patients receiving nano-drugs, as well as from cleaning equipment and areas where nano-products or nano-enabled contrast agents have been used and spilled. Dental and/or surgical procedures involving operations on medical products containing NMs may also cause exposure [2,14].\ntechn\ne h e f d a\nHowever, despite the increasing likelihood of occupational xposure, our knowledge of which NMs may be harmful for the ealth of workers, particularly concerning the influencing role xerted by their physico-chemical properties, i.e. size, shape, surace chemistry, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, aggregation status, egradability and dissolution, is still preliminary. Nanomaterials re not a unified class of compounds, with intrinsically hetero-\nology in biomedical fields.\ngeneous health and safety profiles. Additionally, NMs may have different bio-molecular interactions once introduced into the body that may affect their bio-persistance, bio-accumulation, and toxicodynamic behavior [15].\nCurrently, human biosafety information from clinical trials is limited and some information concerning toxicity of NMs applied in biomedical fields derives from research carried out in in vitro\na m c o t t l e i o m w f t u v s\nO\ns c i h A p a w b\nv h a u a l a t\nnd in vivo experiments. Titanium dioxide ultrafine particles and ulti-walled carbon nanotubes-7 have been classified as possibly arcinogenic to humans [16,17]. However, a correct extrapolation f animal data to human beings remains a challenging issue due o the species-related differences and methodological design of he studies, which frequently does not adequately resemble the ow-dose, long-term conditions of exposure, as those potentially xperienced in the workplace. Additionally, the difficulty in definng those exposure metrics better correlating with toxicological utcomes and affordable environmental monitoring technologies ay prevent correct exposure assessments for healthcare NM orkers. Moreover, some uncertainties remain concerning workorce awareness of the presence of NMs in handled products, and he proper identification of such NMs in safety data sheets or prodct labeling. To date, no biological monitoring strategies have been alidated to assess exposures and early effects of NMs in healthcare ectors [13,18].\nccupational risk assessment and management\nOverall, to evaluate the risks associated with occupational expoure to NMs in biomedical fields is a quite challenging issue, onsidering also the “co-exposure scenarios”, in terms of biologcal, physical, and organizational safety and health hazards that ealthcare workers routinely experience during their job tasks [19]. dditionally, advances in nanotechnology may require a forced rofessional updating for employees to be continuously qualified nd skilled to face such changing occupational realities and to deal ith multidisciplinary expertise involved in nano-technological\niomedical applications [20]. In such developing field, regulatory guidance is needed to proide clarity and legal certainty to manufacturers, policymakers, ealthcare providers, and public, as well as to define possible health nd safety implications for exposed workers. However, the still ncertain scenario warrants efforts for a precautionary risk mangement approach for healthcare workers. This means ensuring a ess toxic profile for NMs according to a “safety by design approach”, s well as adopting reasonable preventive and protective measures hat will change, be continuously evaluated, improved, and verified\nas risk information becomes more substantial. In this context, good practices on work should include transparency and traceability to increase workplace awareness of where nano-enabled products are used and exposure may occur, the adoption/implementation of collective and personal protective equipment to prevent/minimize exposure, and the development of education and training of the staff about measures necessary to face emerging risks. To these aims, the application of pharmaceutical industry good manufacturing procedures, guidance for working with NMs in research laboratories, and guidelines for healthcare workers handling hazardous medicines may be adapted to a nano-enabled healthcare scenario. Occupational health surveillance may serve as a secondary preventive measure to identify biomarkers of exposure and early effect.\nIn this context, it may be important to effectively engage with stakeholders involved from academia to industry, nongovernmental organizations and regulators, workers’ representatives, and occupational health and safety professionals into a whole risk assessment and management process [18]. In conclusion, for biomedical nano-technological applications to be considered for a “responsible benchtop to the bedside” translation, implications for the health and safety of workers should be carefully addressed.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nDisclaimer\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of organizations to which they are affiliated.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank dr.
