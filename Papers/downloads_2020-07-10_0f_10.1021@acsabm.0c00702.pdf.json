      "text" : "Bacteria’s antibiotic resistance is one of the major challenges in the treatment of infectious diseases.\nWith increasing difficulty in discovering antibiotics, there is urgent need to develop antibiotic-free\ntherapeutic strategies to address this grand challenge. In this report, we developed a polypyrrole (PPy)-\nbased photothermal nanoantibiotic (PTNA) for effective treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial\ninfection. PTNA was fabricated by polymerizing pyrrole onto anionic vesicle to integrate the cationic and\nphotothermal properties of PPy for combinatory killing against bacteria. PTNA exhibits strong\nphotothermal effect in the NIR-II (1064 nm) biowindow, thus is feasible for in vivo therapy due to deeper\ntissue penetration. Our in vitro experiments revealed that PTNA can significantly inhibit the growth of\nMDR bacteria (S. Typhimurium), alleviate inflammatory response of infected cells, and prevent biofilm\nformation. More importantly, PTNA showed significant therapeutic effect in S. Typhimurium-infected\nanimal disease model of acute systemic infection by inhibiting bacterial growth, lowering inflammatory\nresponses and pathological changes, and eventually improving the survival rate of mice. Finally, PTNA\nhad safe profiles in vitro and in vivo with no visible toxicity detected. Therefore, we believe PTNA may\nserve as a promising antibiotic-free antimicrobial material for the effective treatment of MDR bacterial\ninfection.\nKeywords: Photothermal therapy, NIR-II window, polypyrrole, antibiotic-free antimicrobial material,\nmultidrug-resistant bacterial infection\nPage 2 of 24\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\nACS Applied Bio Materials\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59"

      "text" : "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), bacterial infection has become a major threat to global public health, which caused the highest death rate in developing countries in the past decade.1 Antibiotics have been the most effective treatment against bacterial diseases.2 However, the long-term\nabuse use of antibiotics has promoted bacterial evolution with resistance against a wide variety of antibiotics, threatening public health via numerous paths including food, water, and livestock.3 A global\nreport by WHO suggested that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are responsible for nearly 700,000 death annually, which is predicted to be 10 million by 2050.4 Therefore, there is a urgent need to address the\nantibiotic resistance crisis worldwide. Discovery of new antibiotics may represent a conventional and yet temporarily effective strategy against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria.5, 6 Nevertheless, there is a\ntrend of decrease in appearance of new antibiotics in the market given the increasing challenge of\nantibiotic discovery.\nDeveloping antibiotic-free strategies against bacterial infection is a promising approach to circumvent\nthis dilemma. Notably, antibacterial nanomaterials have gained remarkable success in killing bacteria, showing great potential to revolutionize antibiotic-free strategies.7 Among which, nanomaterials of\nphotothermal effect under irradiation of near infrared light (NIR, 650-1350 nm) have drawn great attention for fighting bacterial infection due to its effectiveness against MDR bacteria and its safe profile.8, 9 The majority of reported photothermal nanomaterials including carbon-based nanocomposites,10 noble metallic nanomaterials,11 and polymeric nanomaterials12-15 are generally responsive to laser irradiation\nwithin the NIR-I window (650-950 nm), exhibiting relatively short tissue-penetration depth for in vivo use.16 Thus, it is highly desired to develop effective antibacterial photothermal nanomaterials in the NIRII window (1000-1350 nm), especially for treating deep-tissue bacterial infection.17, 18 To date,\nphotothermal nanomaterials that work in the NIR-II window are generally inorganic nanosystems (e.g. gold nanostructures,19-21 MXene,22 carbon-based nanomaterials23), which hold limited clinical translation potential comparing to organic nanomaterials.24, 25 Some studies demonstrated the antibacterial activity\nPage 3 of 24\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\nACS Applied Bio Materials\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nAOT PPy\nPPy-induced therapy Photothermal induced therapyNIR-II\nMDR bacteria PTNA\nPTNA\nFigure 1.

Furthermore, reports have revealed the antimicrobial ability of PPy due to its cationic nature.29, 39, 40 Herein, we combined the photothermal and\nantimicrobial capabilities of PPy into one nanosystem to form a photothermal nanoantibiotic (PTNA). We selected MDR bacterial (S. Typhimurium) to establish a model of acute systemic infection in mice.41\nOur studies revealed that PTNA can serve as a promising NIR-II photothermal antibiotic material for\neffective treatment of MDR bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1), thus hold great\napplication potentials."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed\nthat AOT remained intact after the polymerization of PPy on its membrane (Figure 2a). Dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) revealed a slight increase in size and a significant increase in zeta-potential, suggesting\nthe formation of PTNA (Figure 2b). PTNA exhibited potent stability in various physiological buffers such\nas phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7) and cell culture medium (Figure S1).\n2.2 Photothermal properties of PTNA in the NIR-II window. PTNA exhibited a broad and intense light\nabsorption ranging from the visible to the NIR region covering both NIR-I and NIR-II windows with\nmaximum absorption at ~450 nm and ~1000 nm (Figure 2c, Figure S2). In contrast, adsorption of pyrrole\non AOT without polymerization yielded minimal absorbance in the NIR range, suggesting the intense\nlight absorption capability of PTNA was derived from PPy. We next examined the photothermal\nconversion properties of PTNA in various PPy concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL), which were exposed to continuous-wave laser irradiation at 1064 nm with power of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 W/cm2, at pH\n3.5 or pH 7. PTNA showed a strong laser-power-dependent photothermal conversion effect (Figure 2d,\nFigure S3), with ambient temperature elevated by >40 °C after continuous irradiation for 600 s at power of 1 W/cm2 or above. As reported previously, the in vivo maximum permissible exposure (MPE) for NIR-II light is 1 W/cm2, therefore a laser power of 1 W/cm2 was used for subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments.18 Similar heating curve was observed with PTNA dispersed in the original reaction buffer\n(pH 3.5) or in PBS buffer (pH 7). PTNA exhibited potent photothermal robustness after multicycles of\non-off laser irradiation (Figure 2e). Photothermal conversion of PTNA with laser penetrated through a\npiece of mouse tissue to mimic in vivo conditions was investigated (Figure 2f), with temperature elevated\nby ~20 °C after 600 s of irradiation, suggesting PTNA may serve as an effective photothermal agent in\nvivo. Photothermal properties of PTNA at pH3.5 were measured by the photothermal conversion efficiency\n(η), which was calculated using ; η = [hS(Tmax- Tsurr)-Q0] / [ I (1 – 10-A)] , 51.59%.

Human normal colonic epithelial cells (NCM460) were incubated with\nvarious concentrations of PTNA for 24 hours to examine its cytotoxicity via MTT assay (Figure 3a).\nPTNA was added at 9 hours post seeding cells, which is the measured doubling time of NCM460 cells\n(Figure S4). The cell viability study indicated that PTNA had no visible toxicity at the concentration of 40\nμg / mLor lower.

The hemolysis rate of PTNA-treated cells was 2.3%, which was considered within the safe range according to ISO 10993-4.42\nLastly, in vivo safety test was conducted in mice. PTNA was intragastrically administered at a dosage\nof 0.4 mg/kg, following laser irradiation at 1064 nm for 600 seconds. Histopathological staining of major\norgans and tissues suggested no observable toxicity after photothermal treatment of PTNA (Figure 3d).\nOverall, these results suggested that PTNA has safe in vitro and in vivo profiles and may be further\npursued for treating bacterial infection.\n2.4 In vitro antibacterial activities of PTNA against MDR bacteria. S. Typhimurium is a zoonotic\npathogen and one of the most highly isolated bacteria at present that causes severe gastroenteritis in\nhuman and systemic infection in mice, which is listed at the top of the bacterial food poisoning incidence in the world.43 WHO has expressed serious concern regarding the development of multidrug resistance\nof S. Typhimurium. Drug sensitivity test indicated that S. Typhimurium (strain DT104) is resistant to a\nwide variety of antibiotics including ampicillin, kanamycin, oxacillin, doxycycline, tobramycin, amikacin,\nflorfenicol, gentamycin, and tetracycline (Figure S5).\nThe antibacterial effect of PTNA against S. Typhimurium was examined (Figure 4). 1.0×109 CFU/mL of\nS. Typhimurium was cultured with PTNA (40 μg/mL) along with other control treatments for 1 hour. Comparing to the groups treated with PBS and Laser only (1064 nm, 1 W/cm2, 10 min), significant\nreduction of viable bacteria was observed for PTNA and PTNA/Laser (PTNA-L) treatments (Figure 4a). Bacteria treated with PTNA alone had a reduction of 2 log10(CFU/mL), indicating that PTNA has certain\nantimicrobial property. But with laser irradiation, PTNA can reduce the viability of bacteria by 6 log10(CFU/mL), suggesting the elevated temperature induced by its photothermal effect can significantly\nstrengthen the antibiotic performance of PTNA. The bacteria enter the logarithmic growth phase as the culture time increases, but PTNA-L treatment can still reduce its growth by ~4 log10(CFU/mL) (Figure\nS6). In contrast, PBS, AOT, or laser irradiation had no inhibitive effect on bacteria growth, suggesting\nthe antibacterial effect was derived from PTNA (Figure S7). The antibacterial property of PTNA was\nPage 9 of 24\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\nACS Applied Bio Materials\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nfurther examined on LB agar plates as shown in Figure 4b. A significant reduction in bacterial colonies\nwas achieved by treating bacteria with PTNA-L. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed\nno apparent morphological changes for bacteria treated with PBS, PTNA only, or laser irradiation only,\nwith them exhibiting a rod-like shape of smooth cell walls (Figure 4c). Nevertheless, bacteria treated\nwith PTNA-L suffered from pronounced membrane damage, a sign of dead or dying bacteria. The viability of S. typhimurium was further determined by staining bacteria with SYTOTM9 and propidium\niodide (PI) to distinguish live and dead cells (Figure 4d). In good agreement to above results, PTNA-L\ntreatment nearly killed all the bacteria, while PTNA or laser irradiation separately had very mild\nantibacterial effect. With the deformation and rupture of bacteria, mixtures of cellular components (e.g.\nproteins and nucleic acids) may be released to accumulate around bacteria forming biofilms to resist antimicrobial treatments.44\nTo study whether photothermal treatment of bacteria is capable of prohibiting biofilm formation, we\nquantified the biofilm mass using the crystal violet staining assay (Figure 4e). Except for PBS, treatments\nof PTNA, Laser, and PTNA-L all induced a reduction in the formation of biofilm, with PTNA-L having the\nhighest reduction effect. Taken together, these results unambiguously proved that photothermal effect\nof PTNA in the NIR-II window can significantly inhibit MDR bacteria growth in vitro.\n2.5 Alleviated inflammation in vitro. After bacterial infection, inflammatory response is the major cause for severe organ failure and death of the host.45 In S. Typhimurium-infection, signals transmitted\nthrough ERK kinases are known to induce the expression of proinflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.46 The previous study found that high levels of proinflammatory genes expression favored repeated infections in mice47-49 and was the causes of severe systemic inflammation.50, 51 Besides,\nseveral past studies have demonstrated that the host inflammatory response facilitated S. Typhimurium\ngrowth.52 Here we examined whether the photothermal treatment by PTNA can alleviate bacterial\ninfection-induced cellular inflammation in vitro. NCM460 cells were infected with S. typhimurium and\ncultured with various treatments. The expression of inflammatory factors IL6, IL-8, and TNF-α by the\ninfected cells were measured and calculated against normal cells without infection (Figure 5a).

Notably, Laser and PTNA alone both had certain effects on alleviating the\nproduction of cytokines, indicating they held some heating and antimicrobial properties, respectively,\nbut not as significant as treatment of PTNA-L. p-ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is widely involved in the\nregulation of inflammatory responses. Activation of p-ERK/MAPK signaling pathway induces production of inflammatory factors.53, 54 S. typhimurium-infected cells exhibited significant expression of\nphosphorylated ERK1/2 comparing to normal cells (Figure 5b,c). Treatments of PTNA and PTNA-L can\ndrastically attenuate the activation of p-ERK/MAPK, with PTNA-L having the strongest inhibitive effect.\nIn summary, it is proved that photothermal treatment of S. typhimurium-infected NCM460 cells by PTNA-\nL in the NIR-II window can significantly alleviate the inflammatory responses of infected cells in vitro.\n2.6 Antibacterial activities in vivo. Animal studies were conducted to reveal the therapeutic potential\nof PTNA against acute systemic infection of MDR bacterial.

The survival study lasted for fifteen days with mice given their treatments once a day up to day-7\nPage 12 of 24\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\nACS Applied Bio Materials\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nif there were mice alive within the group. Body weight and temperature were measured on a daily basis.\nOur study revealed that treatment of PTNA-L can drastically increase the survival rate of infected mice,\nwith 50% of mice remained alive on day-15. In contrast, mice treated with PBS or laser did not survive\nbeyond day-5 or day-6, respectively. PTNA alone exhibited some antibacterial activities as well since\nimproved survival rate was observed comparing to treatments of PBS or laser, but with no mice survived\nbeyond day-15. Body weight and temperature exhibited similar trend of the survival curve (Figure S8,\nFigure S9). The survival study suggested that NIR-II photothermal therapy by using PTNA can effectively\ntreat S. typhimurium infection in vivo and eventually improve the survival rate of mice. Another\nindependent animal study was conducted to examine anti-inflammatory properties of PTNA, which\nlasted for five days with mice given their treatments once a day.

A number of 2 mice from each\ngroup were randomly chosen and sacrificed on day-3 and day-5 to collect major organs and tissues for\nmeasuring cytokine levels and for histopathological examinations. Feces were collected on a daily basis\nto measure the level of fecal calprotectin, which is a known acute inflammatory marker. Previous\nresearch had shown that calprotectin was highly induced in the fecal samples of mice infected with S. Typhimurium58, 59 and calprotectin enhances the competitive advantage of S. Typhimurium.60\nMeasurements of cytokines in serum and major organ/tissues collected on day-3 and day-5 revealed\nthat mice treated with PTNA and PTNA-L had significantly alleviated expression of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α,\nwith PTNA-L having the highest inhibitive effect on cytokine production (Figure 6b,c, Figure S10-13).\nFecal calprotectin measurements showed similar results (Figure 6d). Same to in vitro cellular studies,\nwe examined the activities of pERK/MAPK signaling pathway in major organs/tissues by western blotting\n(Figure 6e, Figure S14). S. Typhimurium-infection led to apparent systemic activation of pERK/MAPK\nsignaling pathway in various tissues examined, which was significantly attenuated by treatments of\nPTNA and PTNA-L. In conclusion, PTNA-based photothermal treatment can significantly alleviate the\nactivation of p-ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in S. typhimurium-infected mice and attenuate the\nproduction of inflammatory factors thus lower the risk of systemic acute inflammatory response\nsyndrome post infection and eventually improve the survival rate of mice.\n2.7 Histopathological examinations. The lesions in major organs/tissues on third- and fifth-day post-\ninfection was illustrated (Figure 7, Figure S15 and S16). In the normal group of no bacterial infection,\nthere is no apparent pathological change in tissue sections. In contrast, severe pathological changes\nwere observed in major tissues of bacteria-infected mice if no effective antibacterial treatments were\ngiven, such as mice treated with PBS or laser irradiation. Observed pathological changes include\nmucosal erosion in cecum and duodenum; multifocal hepatocellular necrosis, hepatic sinusal\ninflammatory cell infiltration and bacteria infiltration in liver; multifocal marked necrosis, moderate\nhemorrhage, marked perivascular and alveolar septum inflammatory cell infiltration in lung; necrosis,\nPage 14 of 24\nACS Paragon Plus Environment\nACS Applied Bio Materials\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nmixed cell inflammation, white pulp decreased lymphocyte in spleen. Tissues of mice treated with PTNA\nand PTNA-L underwent significantly alleviated pathological changes, both qualitatively (Figure 7a,\nFigure S15a) and quantitively (Figure 7b, Figure S15b), with mice treated with PTNA-L having the\nminimal pathological changes, suggesting the photothermal therapy by PTNA can significantly lower\ninflammatory response and alleviate pathological changes."

PTNA exhibited strong absorbance in\nthe NIR-II biowindow thus hold great in vivo application potentials. We conducted comprehensive in vitro\nand in vivo experiments to demonstrate that photothermal therapy by PTNA can significantly inhibit the\ngrowth of MDR S. typhimurium, reduce inflammatory responses, alleviate pathological changes, and\neventually increase the survival rate of bacteria-infected mice. We believe PTNA can serve as a\nuniversal photothermal antimicrobial platform to effectively kill a wide variety of MDR bacteria strains.\nTherefore, it holds great clinical translational potential towards various MDR bacterial infection diseases."

    "abstractText" : "Bacteria’s antibiotic resistance is one of the major challenges in the treatment of infectious diseases. With increasing difficulty in discovering antibiotics, there is urgent need to develop antibiotic-free therapeutic strategies to address this grand challenge. In this report, we developed a polypyrrole (PPy)based photothermal nanoantibiotic (PTNA) for effective treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infection. PTNA was fabricated by polymerizing pyrrole onto anionic vesicle to integrate the cationic and photothermal properties of PPy for combinatory killing against bacteria. PTNA exhibits strong photothermal effect in the NIR-II (1064 nm) biowindow, thus is feasible for in vivo therapy due to deeper tissue penetration. Our in vitro experiments revealed that PTNA can significantly inhibit the growth of MDR bacteria (S. Typhimurium), alleviate inflammatory response of infected cells, and prevent biofilm formation. More importantly, PTNA showed significant therapeutic effect in S. Typhimurium-infected animal disease model of acute systemic infection by inhibiting bacterial growth, lowering inflammatory responses and pathological changes, and eventually improving the survival rate of mice. Finally, PTNA had safe profiles in vitro and in vivo with no visible toxicity detected. Therefore, we believe PTNA may serve as a promising antibiotic-free antimicrobial material for the effective treatment of MDR bacterial",
