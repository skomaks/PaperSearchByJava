Over the last decades, attempts have been taken to use nanostructured carbon-based materials, like graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with the aim of improving the efficiency of the abovementioned energy storage systems.\nIn this book chapter, focus has been directed toward the recent progress and advancement on the efficiency of the electrode materials of these renewable energy storage systems via application of CNTs, graphene, or nanohybrid fillers. The ability of these materials to exhibit superior capacity toward photon absorption, capability toward generation of photocarriers, photovoltaic properties, and separation of charge carriers to form heterojunctions makes them ideal applicants in solar cells. The capacitance of a supercapacitor varied with the specific surface area, synthetic approach, pore size, pore size distribution, and posttreatment of these materials. Moreover, high electron conductivity and high surface area of these nanomaterials led to improvements in (a) electrode reaction rates in fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors and (b) charge storage capability of supercapacitors and lithiumion batteries."

      "text" : "2.1.1 Background and Significance\nThe enormous global consumption of energy and significant emission of carbon dioxide have led to a new frontier for research in the field of nanotechnology. Nowadays, the most important challenge that engages human civilization is to restore renewable energy and to achieve a sustainable society free of environmental pollution. Different forms of renewable energies like geothermal, solar, wind power, biofuel, and hydropower have been nurtured by human being. In this context, carbon nanomaterials, like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Banerjee et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2010; Kanninen et al. 2014) and graphene (Wang and Kumta 2010; Tung et al. 2009; Jafri et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2012), and in some cases polymer nanocomposites have been recognized as ideal candidates for utilization in advanced energy storage devices.\nCarbon nanomaterials have found application in energy storage systems owing to their ability to store charges with good electrical and mechanical properties. Carbon nanostructures have been used as electrodes for fuel cells, solar cells, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, and supercapacitors (Gong et al. 2009; Du et al. 2012; Landi et al. 2009). It has been reported that 2.5% of the total power delivered in the USA has been used for storage purposes, whereas the level of energy storage in Europe and Japan are 10% and 15%, respectively (EPRI-DOE 2003).\nThe first solar cell was introduced by Bell executives in 1954. The first fuel cell was invented in 1838, and it was commercialized after a century by NASA for use in power supply for satellites in space. Up until now, batteries have been used as efficient electrical energy storage devices with good portability, excellent energy\npower supply over a prolong time scale, and high energy density. The advent of Li-ion batteries has resulted in overcoming certain limitations, such as resistance toward sudden power surge (Goodenough and Mizuchima 1981; Yazami and Reynier 2002; Nagaura and Tozawa 1990). In 1991, the first Li-ion battery was discovered through the work of Goodenough, Yazami, and others (EPRI-DOE 2003; Goodenough and Mizuchima 1981). In subsequent years, several studies were carried out to develop Li-ion batteries with high capacity. However, there still exist certain limitations for these batteries. In order to improve the capability of the electrical energy storage, supercapacitors or ultracapacitors have been developed with exceptionally high charge/discharge rates. General Electric Co., in 1957, was the first to file a patent on the concept of supercapacitors using carbon, with a high specific surface area, for the electrode and using sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. The first low resistance supercapacitor was commercialized by Pinnacle Research Institute (PRI) in 1982 for military applications. Supercapacitors usually store energy by polarizing an electrolyte solution, whereas dielectric capacitors perform energy storage in the form of separated electrical charges (Conway 1999; Aricò et al. 2005). Supercapacitors produce two orders of magnitude higher power than that of fuel cells and higher efficiency and ability to withstand larger numbers of charge/ discharge cycles, adverse temperature, and environmental conditions."

      "text" : "Figure 2.1 presents the progressive increase over the years in the application of CNTs in solar cells, supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, and fuel cells. It can be observed from the figure that the use of CNTs in the field of energy has increased over the years, and their application is much more prominent in the field of fuel cells as compared to other devices. The extraordinary properties of CNTs, such as excellent electrical conductivity, high entanglements, good thermal conductivity,\nand high resilience, have resulted in extensive application as catalyst-supporting materials in fuel cells (Dutta and Kundu 2014; Dutta et al. 2015a, b; Das et al. 2015a). These nanomaterials have been used for improving the energy efficiency or enhancing the power output of several new devices for energy storage applications (Baughman et al. 2002). Recent research activities include the generation of steam from solar energy, a highly engineered polymer matrix used for high-efficiency light bulbs, generating electricity from waste materials and storing hydrogen for fuel cellpowered cars.\nNanostructured materials have increasingly found application in electrochemical energy storage devices. It is to be mentioned here that it is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a comprehensive summary of the energy storage or energy conversion materials used in the present day or in the future. Instead, an attempt has been made to highlight the application of carbon nanomaterials in the field of Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and solar cells. Figure 2.2 elaborates the use of carbon nanomaterials in four essential energy storage systems, which are considered to be the most promising devices to store renewable energy."

      "text" : "In this new era, development of highly efficient supercapacitors has been one of the most promising fields of research in academia as well as in industry. At present, extensive research work is being focused on the use of carbon nanomaterials as electrodes in supercapacitors. Similar to other capacitors, supercapacitors also consist of two solid/porous electrodes, which remain in contact with a separator and an electrolyte. A schematic diagram of a supercapacitor is presented in Fig. 2.3. While an electrolytic capacitor accumulates charges on the two conductors, which are separated by a dielectric, a supercapacitor stores charges at the interfacial region between the electrolyte solution and the electrode. It can be observed from Fig. 2.3 that there exist porous dielectric materials which prevent the transport of charges\nbetween the electrodes. Usually, supercapacitors can be divided into two classes – (a) pseudocapacitors and (b) electrical double-layer capacitors (ELDC) (Pan et al. 2010). The basic difference between these two types of capacitors is in their charge transfer and storage aspects, i.e., a pseudocapacitor follows faradaic charge-transfer laws, whereas an ELDC obeys the non-faradaic charge-transfer mechanism. It was found that in case of ELDC, the storage of electrical energy remains electrostatic without any electron transfer, resulting in the formation of a Helmholtz layer (Emmenegger et al. 2003). However, there are some exceptions, including several carbon electrodes with high specific surface area, which showed pseudocapacitance due to the presence of redox-active moieties (Gong et al. 2009). ELDC comprises an electrochemical redox reaction between the electrodes and the electrolytes, which involves charge transfer. Hence, the capacitance of EDLC is much higher than that of the pseudocapacitors.\nFigure 2.4 depicts the comparison (from Ragone plot) of the power and the volumetric specific energy densities of a supercapacitor, an electrolytic capacitor, a microsupercapacitor based on activated carbon (AC), and a lithium thin-film battery. In general, it is observed that for a supercapacitor, the negatively charged ions present within the electrolyte migrate toward the positively charged electrode and the positively charged ions move toward the negatively charged electrode, forming two layers of capacitive storage. This gives an added advantage for the two capacitors present in series over the single capacitor, and hence, the capacitance of the cell is given by:\nCCellð Þ 1 ¼ C1 1 þ C2 1 ð2:1Þ\nwhere Ccell represents the overall capacitance value of the two terminal devices and C1 and C2 are the individual capacitance values of the two electrodes (Pandolfo and Hollenkamp 2006; Wang et al. 2012; Frackowiak and Béguin 2001).\nThe electrical energy stored within the supercapacitor is given by Pech et al. (2010):\nE ¼ CV 2 2 ¼ QV 2 ð2:2Þ\nwhere E stands for the accumulated electrical energy, Q is the stored charge, V represents the voltage, and C stands for the capacitance of the cell.\nIt has been suggested that the charge stored by the cell and the cell capacitance are dependent upon the electrode material, whereas the operating voltage depends simply on the stability window of the electrolyte (Nagaura and Tozawa 1990). Although supercapacitors possess high power owing to the presence of the doublelayer system, their output power density remains low due to the series resistance. The energy density (E, Whkg 1) of a supercapacitor is given by:\nE ¼ CcellV 2\n2m ð2:3Þ\nThe power density (P) of a supercapacitor can be presented as:\nP ¼ E ΔT\nð2:4Þ\nThe maximum power density produced by a supercapacitor can be presented as:\nPmax ¼ V 2\n4mRs ð2:5Þ\nwhere Pmax is the maximum power output by the supercapacitor, m stands for the mass of the active material, Δt represents the discharge time, and Rs is the equivalent resistance in series (ESR).\nWhen the internal resistance of the cell becomes equal to its load resistance, then the device (any energy storage device) achieves the maximum power output. The power and energy densities of the cell depend on the volumetric capacitance, the ESR, and the cell voltage of the device. The ESR consists of the electrolyte resistance, the mass transfer resistance toward the movement of ions through the pores present within the matrix, the internal resistance of the electrode matrix, and various other types of resistances existing within the cell (Aricò et al. 2005). The performance of a supercapacitor mainly depends on its self-discharge rate and leakage current, whereas its cyclic stability depends on the nature and chemistry of the electrode materials. Thermodynamically, a fully charged supercapacitor possesses higher free energy as compared to a discharged one. Therefore, it is the general tendency of a supercapacitor to self-discharge in order to equilibrate with the environment. There exist three types of materials that can be utilized for fabricating the electrodes. They are high surface area AC materials, oxides of transition metals, and electroactive polymers."

      "heading" : "2.2.2 Fuel Cells",
      "text" : "Fuel cells are environmentally friendly energy-storing devices, possessing low or no emission threat and high energy conversion and power density (Dutta et al. 2015b). The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is mainly used for low-temperature mobile applications (Dutta et al. 2014a, b; Kundu and Dutta 2016). Their slow electrode kinetics resulted in a significant amount of costly and scarce catalyst materials (especially Pt metal) being used (Kumar et al. 2014a). Similar to batteries, fuel cells also convert chemical energy to electrical energy producing heat and water as a by-product (Dutta et al. 2016a, b). In the case of fuel cells, the fuel is fed to the anode side of the cell, while the oxidant is fed at the cathode side of the cell (Kumar et al. 2014b); electrochemical reactions take place at the two electrodes (Das et al. 2015b). Electrons are generated at the anode and are then transferred to the cathode through the external circuit to produce electricity. The electrolyte also plays a crucial role in the operation of the fuel cell (Dutta et al.\n2014c, 2015c). It helps in the transportation of the generated protons from the anode to the cathode side and prevents mixing of the contents of the anode and the cathode chambers (Dutta et al. 2014d, 2016c). In the last few decades, several attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of fuel cells by using innovative and other catalysts in place of the state-of-the-art Pt metal. This is owing to the fact that Pt is extremely costly and scarce, thus hindering commercialization of the fuel cell devices (Das et al. 2015c, 2016). Several new catalyst supports have also been developed in place of traditionally used carbon black. These include carbon nanomaterials, like CNTs and graphene, as well as other nanomaterials that help in improving the capability of the catalyst (Landi et al. 2009; EPRI-DOE 2003; Goodenough and Mizuchima 1981; Yazami and Reynier 2002; Das et al. 2015a). Other worth-mentioning materials used as a support matrix are mesoporous carbon materials (Chang et al. 2007; Chai et al. 2004), carbon nanocoils (Sevilla et al. 2007), and mesocarbon microbeads (Bai et al. 2007). It is important to mention here that the performance of a catalyst improves with the increase in its surface area. However, there is evidence which shows that a decrease in the efficiency of metal nanoparticles with a decrease in the particle size occurs due to particle-size effect (Kinoshita 1990; Yahikozawa et al. 1991; Kabbabi et al. 1994). Therefore, in order to improve the performance of the catalyst, it is supported on materials possessing high surface area. Porous materials possessing high mesoporous characteristics and good electrical conductivity for easy flow of electrons are ideal for being used as supports. Proper and uniform dispersion of the catalyst on the supporting material is the primary concern in improving the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Several studies have revealed that the mere decoration of the external and the internal walls of CNTs with active materials, like Ru, Pt, and Ru-Pt alloy, leads to an increase in the catalytic activity of the catalyst (Debe 2012; Liu et al. 2002; Lordi et al. 2001; Che et al. 1998, 1999; Planeix et al. 1994).\nCNTs-based fuel cells have been found to possess high catalytic activity and high quality of transmission and production of large current densities (Yoshitake et al. 2002; Li et al. 2005; Mink and Hussain 2013). CNTs have been applied as supporting materials for both the anode and the cathode of the fuel cells (Liu et al. 2002; He et al. 2004a, b; Guo and Li 2004). There are several aspects that make CNTs a more preferred candidate over other materials, which include higher crystalline nature, higher chemical stability, better electrical and thermal properties, and a 3D structure favoring sufficient space for reaction. Moreover, the absence of impurities in purified CNTs helps in inhibiting the formation of any toxic intermediate(s) (Hamon et al. 1999). Figure 2.5 displays a schematic diagram of a typical fuel cell."

      "text" : "Solar cell devices are those which use solar energy as the only fuel and produce electrical charges by photovoltaic effect, so that these can move freely in semiconductors and finally through an electric load (motor or bulb) (McEvoy et al. 2012).\nA solar cell involves direct harvesting of sunlight into solar energy using small photovoltaic cells (Fahrenbruch and Bube 1983). From the advent of the first solar cell, which was a silicon (Si)-based cell (Yadav and Kumar 2015), this has gained enormous attention from research communities (Castellano 2010). The first generation of solar cells was produced on silicon wafers either using monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon crystals (Srinivas et al. 2015; Würfel and Würfel 2009; Dmitrijev 2006; Saga 2010; Jayakumar 2009). Usually, silicon wafers have a thickness of 350 μm, whereas the second-generation thin-film solar cells possess a thickness of 1 μm. The second-generation solar cells are amorphous silicon, CdTe, and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) (Naghavi et al. 2003; Li et al. 2014b; Goswami and Kreith 2007; Luque and Hegedus 2003; Elsabawy et al. 2012; Razykov et al. 2011). The most recent and promising generation of solar cells consists of concentrated solar cells, polymer-based solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, nanocrystal-based solar cells, and perovskite-based solar cells. Over the last decades, organic materials like conducting polymers have been used as ideal candidates for the photovoltaics in solar cells. It has been found that organic\nsemiconductors have the potential to absorb solar energy within a few thin layers. However, there exist some limitations in using organic photovoltaics. In order to improve the efficiency of polymer photovoltaics, CNTs have been used. CNTs help in improving the charge conduction, the optoelectronic properties, and the thermal and chemical properties of the cells (Candelaria et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2004). In this chapter, the application of various carbon nanomaterials in photovoltaic solar cells, organic solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSC), and silicon-based solar cells has been highlighted. DSSCs are defined as photoelectrochemical solar cell devices which involve absorption of solar energy by dyes and transferring it to the semiconductor oxide present within the cell. Figure 2.6a shows a schematic of the currently used p-n junction photovoltaic cells. This PEC DSSC consists of a semiconductor, assembled with a working electrode and a conducting transparent substrate. Figure 2.6b presents porous TiO2 nanostructures, with a coating of dye on it, assembled with CNTs. The dye molecule assembled with TiO2 absorbs photonic energy which is then transmitted onto the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 with a porous structure. This results in excitation of an electron from the ground to an excited state, presumably to the conduction band of TiO2. This electron, excited from the absorbed photon energy, after passage through the TiO2 layer, forms the first layer of transparent conducting layer as the anode and the second layer as the cathode. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 2.6c (Yan et al. 2013).\nSilicon has long been considered as an ideal candidate for electrode material in solar technology. However, high cost and low stability limit the application of\nsilicon in solar cells. In this context, carbon nanomaterials play an important role in increasing the commercialization potential of solar cells. CNTs find application as heterojunctions in solar cells and also as windows/back electrodes. Semiconducting CNTs possess a direct bandgap which facilitates optical transition without the intervention of photons. Stewart and Léonard (2004) have reported that the photoresponse generated at the p-n junction of CNTs have unusual behavior, i.e., appearance of multiple sharp peaks in visible, ultraviolet, and infrared regions. In addition, it has been found that there exists a size effect at this nanoscale region where photocurrent scales linearly and starts oscillating with the length of the devices. Moreover, it was suggested that even bundled CNTs and CNT films were also able to produce photocurrent (Wei et al. 2006; Lu and Panchapakesan 2006; Itkis et al. 2006; Lien et al. 2006). Another application of CNTs in solar cells is their use as windows/back electrodes. It has been demonstrated that a thin layer composed of metallic CNTs performs electrical conductivity along the lateral direction and collects current from the front surface of the thin-film solar cells. Studies have proved that CNTs circuits and coatings act as an efficient alternative to traditional conductive materials, like fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), indium tin oxide (ITO), cadmium sulfide, or zinc oxide. It has been found that the performance of solar cells depends on the type of CNTs employed. Attempts have been taken to synthesize single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) from cheap petroleum coke as the carbon source using an arc-discharge method (Xu et al. 2014). SWCNTs-based solar cells exhibit better performance under LED illumination in the range of 400–940 nm as compared to DWCNTsbased solar cells under 1310 nm infrared light LED illumination."

      "text" : "In order to keep pace with the advancement of computers, the battery technology has also improved a lot from nickel cadmium (NiCd) used for wireless communications and mobile computing to nickel metal hydride (NiMH) and finally to Li-ion batteries with high capacity (Banerjee and Dutta 2017). The challenge for developing new generation Li-ion batteries depends on the advancement of electrodes and electrolytes which can withstand hundreds of charge-discharge cycles with minimum capacity fading. The Li-ion battery cell (Fig. 2.7) involves intercalation and de-intercalation of Li-ions into the electrodes (anode and cathode) depending on charging or discharging. The process of charging or discharging depends on the mobility of the Li-ions exchanged between the electrodes through electrolytes followed by the flow of electrons in the external circuits. The increasing demand of Li-ion battery emerges from its high volumetric energy, high power density, minimal self-discharge, and long cycle life (Etacheri et al. 2011; Armand and Tarascon 2008; Scrosati and Garche 2010; Nazri and Pistoia 2003). Figure 2.8\nshows the power and energy densities of Li-ion, Li-S, and Li-O2 batteries. However, there remain some problems with each of these three types of batteries (Yuan et al. 2016b).\nIt has been found that conventional cathodes like LiCoO2, LiFePO4, Li3V2(PO4)3, and LiMn2O4 and anodes like graphite, silicon, and tin based and even oxides possess respective drawbacks. Metallic oxides have good cycle stability with high reversible capacity loss. Besides, carbon-based materials exhibit high\ncycle performance; however, they lack efficiency. Electrodes comprised of conventional materials undergo subsequent expansion and contraction, leading to damage of the electrodes. This can be overcome by using carbon nanomaterials like CNTs and graphene, which possess high conductivity, high electron mobility, and superconductivity, along with less resistive heating, and, therefore, can be operated at low temperatures. It has been further studied that Li-ions insert within the defects of CNTs present on the surface and even between the layers (Goriparti et al. 2014). This incorporation of Li+ within the defects of CNTs leads to production of further defects, which is followed by deepening and shortening of the diffusion path for Li-ions (Han et al. 2012; Wu et al. 1999).\nIt is now important to think about the reason behind the improvement in the performance of the energy storage devices using nanomaterials. The significant increase in the efficiency of the energy storage or conversion devices upon a change from bulk to nanoscale materials is due to the increase in electrode/electrolyte contact area, which improves the rate of electrode reactions (Aricò et al. 2005). Increase in interfacial area and grain boundaries leads to increase in the density of mobile defects at the space charge region, which eventually imparts excellent electrochemical properties to the nanomaterials."

      "text" : "The porous structures of graphene and CNTs were studied in order to improve the energy storage capability of supercapacitors. Freestanding mats of entangled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), with H2SO4 electrolyte, have shown significant improvement in the specific capacitance of the electrodes of supercapacitors (Niu et al. 1997). Attempts have been made to study the effect of vertically aligned and random CNTs on the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor electrodes (An et al. 2001; Futaba et al. 2006). It has been demonstrated that Au-MnO2/CNT coaxial electrodes, prepared by a complex process, exhibit an energy density value of 4.5 Whkg 1 and a specific capacitance of 68 Fg 1 in an aqueous electrolyte (Reddy et al. 2010). CNTs-implanted mesoporous carbon spheres as the electrode in an aqueous electrolyte have been fabricated in order to provide additional porosity and to improve the electrical conductivity of the carbon spheres (Yi et al. 2011). These mesoporous carbon spheres possessed a diameter of approximately 0.5–1.0 mm, an average pore size of 3.9 nm and a specific surface area of 284 m2 g 1. This electrode produced an ESR value of 0.83 Vcm2, a maximum specific capacitance value of 189 Fg 1 and a power density value of 8.7 kWkg 1 at an energy density value of 6.6 Whkg 1. Random SWCNTs networks have also shown significant value of specific capacitance in the presence of KOH electrolyte with a power density of 20 kWkg 1 and an energy density of 10 Whkg 1\n(Chen and Dai 2013). An MnO2-based nanocomposite, formed by electrophoretic\ndeposition of exfoliated CNTs on nickel foam followed by deposition of nanoparticles, like Pt, Pd, or Au, led to the generation of a hybrid supercapacitor exhibiting a specific capacitance value of 559.1 Fg 1 (Zhao et al. 2013). This electrode displayed extremely good conducting and 3D porous structure for easy electrolyte penetration and ion delivery in the presence of 1-butyl-3methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM-PF6)/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte. Xiao et al. have assembled a supercapacitor composed of functionalized freestanding CNTs as the positive electrode and freestanding CNT/MoO3-x as the negative electrode with a high volumetric capacitance value of 3.0 Fcm 3 and high power and energy densities of 4.2Wcm 3 and 1.5 mWhcm 3, respectively, with a stable operation window between 0 and 1.9 V (Xiao et al. 2014).\nPolypyrrole (PPy)/CNT composite was prepared by utilizing CVD-grown CNTs on ceramic foam, followed by PPy coating by chemical polymerization (Lee et al. 2011a). It was observed that PPy not only acted as a binder but also helped in interconnecting the CNTs agglomerates, thus helping in retaining the capacitance of the electrode after 5000 redox cycles. Polyaniline (PAni), with carbon porous material having a high surface area, exhibited a high specific capacitance and an improved cycle life. PAni composites, i.e., PAni/graphene, PAni/carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and PAni/CNT, produced higher specific capacitance values compared to PAni (Wang et al. 2013a; Luo et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013; Dong et al. 2007). PAni/ longitudinally unzipped CNTs composites, synthesized by an in situ chemical oxidation process, have shown 81% retention in capacitance even after 1000 cycles and improved cyclability (Fathi et al. 2014). The electrochemical analysis revealed that PAni/partially unzipped carbon nanotubes (UCNTs) composites produced a much higher specific capacitance value of 762 Fg 1, compared to that exhibited by pure PAni (i.e., 295 Fg 1), at a scan rate of 30 mVs 1. Cheng et al. (2014) have analyzed the properties of nickel oxide (NiOx)-based nanoparticles, which were formed by the process of self-assembly on poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)-CNTs composites as substrate with the aid of microwave radiation. These nanoparticles possessed a particle size of 2–3 nm. In addition, the synergistic effect arising between the homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles and PEI-CNTs composites resulted in improvement in the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode. It can be inferred from Fig. 2.9 that with an increase in the number of nanoparticles, the particle size increased along with an increase in the density. PEI-functionalized CNTs proved to be effective in facilitating the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles on CNTs.\nThe thermally decomposed NiO has, however, shown the presence of large-size particles due to heat treatment at high temperature. The electrochemical performance of the electrode has been studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV), which showed that the anodic and cathodic peaks were symmetric in nature, suggesting reversibility of the process. Moreover, it was also found that the specific capacitance value of NiOx/PEI-CNTs was much higher compared to that of unsupported NiO (i.e., 2584 Fg 1) and NiO/PEI-CNTs mixture (i.e., 276 Fg 1 based on active materials). It has also been reported that controlled KOH activation and nitrogen doping with melamine improved the specific capacitance, the specific surface area of CNTs, as well as the rate performance along with a stable performance even after 1000 cycles\n(Yun et al. 2014). Supercapacitors comprised of these modified CNTs exhibited a specific power of 1750 Wkg 1 and a high specific energy of 59 Whkg 1 over the voltage range of 0–3.5 V. SWCNTs-coated mesoporous cellulose fibers prepared by “dip-absorption-polymerization” method followed by infiltration and in situ polymerization of aniline have been used as an electrode in supercapacitors (Ge et al. 2015). This flexible, foldable, and lightweight electrode composed of wrapped SWCNTs around interpenetrating cellulose fibers and PAni, formed through in\nsitu polymerization within SWCNTs network, showed excellent mechanical properties even after 1000 cycles of folding/unfolding with 35% capacitance retention. This hybrid material displayed good volumetric and areal capacitance of 40.5 Fcm 3 and 0.33 Fcm 2, respectively. CNTs with high electrical conductivity and surface area were found to enhance the energy storage capacity of the electrode. Successful attempts have been made to develop a supercapacitor having volume power and energy densities in the order of 10 Wcm 3 and 10 3 Whcm 3, respectively (Liu et al. 2015a). This device comprised of a conductive DWCNTs film as a current collector and a 1:1 mixture of graphene and MWCNTs films as an electrode. These two carbon films were coated on a PET paper, with a gelled electrolyte to bind them. Recently, thin freestanding CNT sheets obtained from thick CNT sheets fabricated by an inverse order process exhibited stable electrochemical and improved capacitance properties (Koo et al. 2015). It was further observed that the specific capacitance of the CNT sheets depends on the number of layers of the thin CNT sheets. The smaller the number of layers of CNT sheets, the larger is the specific capacitance of the electrode. Other nanocomposites that find application in supercapacitors are Na0.35MnO2/CNT (Zhang et al. 2014a), MnO2/CNTs (Li et al. 2014a), NiCo2O4/ CNTs CNFs (Iqbal et al. 2016), and CNTs/NiCo2S4 (Li et al. 2016a). Porous structure of CNTs aerogel increases the specific surface area of CNTs modified carbon from 123 to 629 m2g 1 (Ciszewski et al. 2016). It was found to minimize the materials shrinkage and improve the specific capacity of the electrode as compared to carbon aerogel. Schopf and Es-Souni (2016) had studied the effect of porousstructured PVDF-MWCNT nanocomposite films on the specific capacitance of the electrode (increased of specific capacitance from 80 to 120 Fg 1). Nanoclay-based polyindole/CNT composites synthesized via facile in situ and ex situ processes have been used as self-assembled ternary electrodes for a supercapacitor with enhanced electrochemical properties (Oraon et al. 2016). It has been reported that CuS/CNT preparation by a solvothermal process involves multi-directional growth of hexagonal covellite CuS over the CNTs surface. Polyimidazole/CuS/CNT composites have been used as electrodes with areal capacitance of 1.51 Fcm 2 at a current density of 5 mAcm 2 (higher compared to CuS/CNT electrode) (Ravi et al. 2016).\nRecently, it has been found that high contact resistance existing between CNT electrodes and their low reactivity toward electrolyte lead to some limitations in their application in the field of supercapacitors. Moreover, restrictions in scaling up of the production of CNTs limit this commercialization. Recent investigations revealed that exfoliated GO processed through solution and even edge-functionalized graphene hold potential in replacing CNTs as carbon-based electrodes in supercapacitors (Van Noorden 2011; Park and Ruoff 2009; Jeon et al. 2012, 2013; Dai 2013; Liu et al. 2012a; Bag et al. 2016). A double-layer capacitor, composed of graphene electrode, has shown a higher specific capacitance of 550 Fg 1, and in some case, it also has showed compared to that of the CNT electrodes (Xia et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2010). Although graphene sheets have higher specific surface area, the presence of π-π forces often leads to restacking of the graphene sheets. The graphene electrode has showed good cyclic stability (97% of capacitance) even after 5000 cycles (Bag et al. 2016).\nIt has been reported that holey graphene nanosheets (GNS), prepared by ultrarapid heat treatment during thermal reduction/exfoliation of graphene oxide (GO), have shown 49% higher specific capacitance (i.e., 211 Fg 1 at 0.5 Ag 1) than non-holey GNS (Peng et al. 2015). A composite of GO/PPy/MWCNTs has been reported by Wang et al. (2015). It was found that the incorporation of GO and MWCNTs formed 3D networks within the composites, while the PPy formed a bridge between GO and MWCNTs particles, resulting in improved conductivity of the composites. The capacitance retention of the composites remained at 92% even after 1000 cycles. Independently, PAni/reduced GO composites, prepared by in situ polymerization, exhibited high specific capacitance values (Wang et al. 2010; Yuan et al. 2011). Porous-structured nanocomposites comprised of NiCo2O4 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), supported on nickel foam, have been employed as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors (Luo et al. 2014). These composites retained about 87.6% of their capacitance upon increasing the current density from 1 to 20 Ag 1. Figure 2.10 presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of NiCo2O4-rGO composite. An irregular porous network structure can be clearly observed from the Fig. 2.10a–d. The inset of Fig. 2.10c displays the SEM images for pure NiCo2O4 nanoparticles. TEM micrograph in Fig. 2.10e revealed uniform dispersion of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles on the surface of rGO. The high-resolution TEM micrograph in Fig. 2.10f showed that the interspace between adjacent stacks was 0.468 nm, which is close to the interspace present in pure NiCo2O4.\nHighly uniform thick rGO synthesized by reducing GO by metallic copper at ambient temperature has shown excellent electrochemical properties in a neutral\nLi2SO4 aqueous solution along with improved conductivity (Li and Yang 2014). Graphene-based electrodes synthesized by laser reduction of graphene oxide have shown specific capacitance 81 Fg 1 at 1000 mVs 1 and 130 Fg 1 at 5 mVs 1 (Yang and Bock 2017). It was observed that the value of specific capacitance of the electrode depends on irradiation time and laser energy. It was found that the growth of PAni on graphene depends on its functionality and the most negatively charged graphene is able to produce neat and vertical growth of PAni. The performance of the graphene-based supercapacitor depends on the size of graphene. It has been observed that reducing the graphene size from a micrometer to hundreds of nanometers leads to increase in energy density and power storage (Lu et al. 2016). However, further decrease in size of graphene into tens of nanometers minimizes both the energy density and power storage. It is postulated that the high resistance of defective edge regions and the increase in frequency of charge transfer lead to this effect. CNTs grown on copper substrate, using an alumina buffer layer between the components, have been reported to show excellent performance as electrodes in supercapacitors. CNTs have been grown on radio frequency (RF)-plasma treated copper substrate followed by hydrogen treatment on the copper substrate to restrict the copper oxide formation. LiClO4was used as an electrolyte. Al2O3 not only acted as a diffusive layer for the reactant gas to react with the catalyst but also inhibited catalyst agglomeration. Ni(OH)2-graphene sheet-CNTs composites, prepared by solvothermal procedure, have also been used as an effective electrode for supercapacitors. It was reported that the specific surface area of the graphene sheet increased due to the addition of CNTs, which inhibited the restacking of the graphene sheets (Liu et al. 2015c).\nNitrogen doping has been found to enhance the performance of the graphenebased electrodes for supercapacitors. It has been reported that the doping of nitrogen in graphene helps in enhancement of the electron transfer and, thus, helps in improving the performance of the graphene-based electrodes (Wei and Kivioja 2013; Sun et al. 2011b, 2012; Chen et al. 2012a; Wen et al. 2012). However, the unspecified distribution of nitrogen and agglomeration of N-doped graphene limit its application. Different materials used for fabricating supercapacitor electrodes and their associated properties have been presented in Table 2.1."

      "text" : "Researchers have studied the role of carbon nanomaterials, like CNTs and graphene, in enhancing the performance of fuel cells (Gharibi et al. 2013; Wu and Shaw 2005; Huang et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014). Microbial fuel cells (MFCs), i.e., electrochemical devices that convert energy stored within organic wastes into useful electrical energy, composed of an anode and a cathode separated by a cation-specific membrane (Nandy et al. 2015). At the anode, the microbes oxidize the organic fuel to generate protons which transfer to the cathode through a membrane, and the electrons passes through the anode to an external circuit to produce current (Das\net al. 2018a; Dutta and Kundu 2018). These MFCs are used for wastewater treatment, desalination, hydrogen production, and generation of electricity (Kundu and Dutta 2018; Liu et al. 2004; Cao et al. 2009). It has been reported that macroporous structure is formed in sponge/CNTs composites produced by coating sponge with CNTs. This sponge/CNTs composite electrode has low internal resistance and high chemical stability. A maximum volumetric power density value of 182 Wm 3 and a maximum areal power density value of 1.24 Wm 2 were obtained by using this electrode (Xie et al. 2012). A significant improvement in the performance of MFC has also been observed where CNTs-doped PAni has been used as the anode (Qiao et al. 2007), as compared to the MFC based on neat PAni. It has also been reported that an MFC has shown an improved power density as compared to graphite, using nanofluids and a CNT-based electrode (Sharma et al. 2008). The nanofluid was composed of dispersed nanocrystalline Pt anchored with CNTs in water.\nDirect methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are studied for their various applications in automobile industries and do not even require a separate hydrogen generation system. A DMFC is an electrochemical device that converts energy stored within the chemical bonds of the fuel (methanol) into useful electrical energy. The wide availability, low cost, and easy processability of methanol (which is used as a fuel) make DMFC an attractive fuel cell system (Liu et al. 2006; Lim et al. 2008). In general, Pt has been used as an electrode for methanol oxidation. However, the formation of the intermediate CO species leads to poisoning of the Pt catalyst (Kumar et al. 2014c). Therefore, binary, ternary, and quaternary catalyst systems have been developed to overcome this serious issue (Das et al. 2018b; EPRI-DOE 2003; Yazami and Reynier 2002). Another approach to minimize this poisoning effect is to select an appropriate catalyst-supporting material. The primary goals for a catalyst support are to (a) stabilize the catalyst particles, (b) assist in exposing a high active surface area of the deposited catalyst, (c) take part in the electrode reactions, (d) mitigate the catalyst surface from poisoning, and (e) improve the mass transfer. In this context, conductive polymers have found potential applications as catalystsupporting matrices (Kundu and Dutta 2016; Dutta and Kundu 2014; Wang et al. 2010, 2015; Kristian et al. 2009; Ishikawa et al. 2000). Studies have revealed that the employment of conducting polymers as host matrices for metal nanoparticles for the uniform distribution of nanoparticles is one of the foremost criteria for the better performance of fuel cells. This assists in electrooxidation of small organic molecules, like formic acid, methanol, and hydrogen, in the presence of metal nanoparticle catalysts (Qu et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2011). Prasad et al. (2012) have demonstrated that the electrolytic activity of the Pt-MWCNTs/PAni catalyst system is higher than the individual Pt-MWCNTs and Pt catalyst systems. Besides, PAni- and PPy-modified CNTs have also been the focus of research as catalyst supports for fuel cells (Selvaraj and Alagar 2007). Zhao et al. (2009) have studied the effect of co-deposited PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles on PPy-MWCNTs composites. This anode support was found to display stable methanol electrooxidation and improved catalytic activity. It was further revealed that overoxidation leads to alteration of the structure and arrangement of the PPy matrix, which helps in the exposure of more PtCo nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. This,\nin turn, increases the utilization of Pt. Studies revealed that Pt-CeO2/CNTs composites improved the catalytic activity of the Pt catalyst and also helped in the stripping of CO at lower potentials (Wang et al. 2007).\nNitrogen-containing CNTs, synthesized by reacting toluene with acrylonitrile produced by the CVD process on silicon wafer followed by impregnation with iron-tetramethoxyphenylporphyrin chloride (including a heat treatment step), led to a new cathode for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs) (Prehn et al. 2009). It has been reported that the fabrication of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) with modified cast-drop technique and the addition of irontetramethoxyphenylporphyrin chloride led to an improvement in the electroactivity of the catalyst and enhanced utilization in fuel cells. Chen et al. (2013) have observed an improvement in absorption kinetics of Mg along with faster hydriding kinetics up to 6.6 wt% only in 1 min at 150 C in the presence of ball-milled CNTs. Graphite/polypropylene composite bipolar plates have been prepared using 304 stainless steel as a support and CNTs as a conducting interlayer by Lee et al. (2011c). The addition of CNTs to the composite has not only enhanced its efficiency up to 91% compared to the graphite bipolar plate but also has improved the mechanical and the electrical properties of the composites. CNTs produced by a facile method, using Fe-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica as catalyst templates, have been used for the fabrication of Pt/CNT anodic electrocatalysts for DMFC applications and methanol oxidation reaction (Lo et al. 2011). It has been realized that the diameter of CNTs plays a significant role in dispersing Pt nanoparticles and even on the performance of the electrocatalyst. For example, Pt/MWCNTs electrocatalyst, with CNTs having a diameter greater than 8 nm, exhibited better electrocatalytic performance than that of the conventional Pt/Vulcan XC-72 carbon and Pt/SWCNT catalysts. Catalysts PtRu/CNTs and PtRuMo/CNTs, synthesized by microwave-assisted technique and used as anode for DMFC, have been studied by Chen et al. (2010b). The authors inferred that the incorporation of Mo helped in decreasing the energy of each of the Pt sites. The performance of DMFC was found to improve with increasing temperature. This observation was attributed to a corresponding increase in the ion conductivity within the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), leading to an enhancement of the catalyst efficiency. PtCo/PPy-MWCNTs cathode catalysts, synthesized by the one-pot synthetic route with two active sites Pt and CoNx, have been used for ORR in fuel cells (Zhao et al. 2012). The second transition metal helped in improving the performance of the catalyst through synergistic effect.\nPt/CNTs catalysts for PEMFCs, with stable electrochemical properties, have been the center of research for the last decade (Shao et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006; Li et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2005). Due to the highly inert nature of CNTs, it is difficult to deposit Pt on them, resulting in separation during ultrasonication. Therefore, He et al. (2011) have used PAni as a bridge between Pt and CNTs, which resulted in improved interfacial interaction between Pt and CNTs. It was observed that PAni forms a wrapping layer on CNTs through π-π interaction. In addition, the electron pair present on nitrogen atoms in PAni forms a coordination complex with the space orbital of Pt. PAni also helps in transferring electrons from Pt to CNTs, thus\ninhibiting the agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles. This results in improving the stability and the performance of Pt in acidic conditions, which is considered to be the most effective condition for PEMFC operations.\nPt is the most commonly used electrocatalyst, especially at low-temperature PEMFC operations, both for the anodic oxidation and the cathodic reduction reactions (Steele and Heinzel 2001; Aricò et al. 2001). PtRu/PAni/MWCNT catalysts, prepared by chemical reduction of H2PtCl6 and RuCl3 by NaBH4, possessing a particle size range of 2–4 nm, have shown an improved activity, enhanced Pt utilization, higher specific surface area, and lower methanol oxidation potential as compared to the catalyst based on bare MWCNTs (Lee et al. 2011b).\nFigure 2.11 presents a schematic diagram describing the preparation of the PtRu/ PAni/MWCNT catalyst. Microscopic studies have revealed that the bimetallic particles of PtRu form homogeneous dispersion on PAni/MWCNTs composite with a “fiber in a jacket” nanostructure. It has been observed that the addition of PAni was responsible for generating the hydrophilicity of the CNTs surface and, thus, facilitated the homogeneous dispersion of PtRu particles. Indium tin oxide (ITO) and CNTs hybrid catalysts have been used as a support for Pd catalyst deposition, using microwave-assisted polyol method with different concentrations of ITO (Qu et al. 2014). It has been found that the addition of ITO has improved the activity and the stability of formic acid oxidation on this supported catalyst due to the interaction between Pd and ITO (substantiated by XPS analysis). Experimental results have revealed that the peak current density obtained for the electrooxidation of formic acid on the ITO/Pd-CNTs catalyst system was 1.5 times and 2 times higher than Pd/CNTs and Pd/ITO catalyst systems, respectively. Liu et al. (2007) studied the mechanical and performance improvement of Pt/CNTs by introducing a novel sandwich structure comprising a Pt/CNTs layer sandwiched between two Nafion layers. This Pt/CNTs layer between two Nafion layers helped in catalytic recombination of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen permeating through the PEM from the\nanode to the cathode sides. Joo et al. (2008) observed that functionalization of CNTs by poly(arylenesulfone) (PAS) enhanced the performance of DMFCs. PtRu/CNTsulfonated PAS (sPAS) composite has low-ohmic resistance, high mechanical strength, high power densities, and high durability as compared to pristine sPAS membrane.\nIt has also been reported that CNTs are applicable even as a bioanode for a glucose/O2 biofuel cell (BFC). This novel anode consisted of CNTs-immobilized mediator and silk film (SF)-immobilized glucose oxidase (GOD) (Liu et al. 2012b). The resulting bioanode showed an excellent stability and improved catalytic activity, producing a current density of 0.51 mAcm 2 for 0.07 M glucose at 0.01 Vs 1. Successful attempts have been performed by Jin et al. (2014) to generate a metal-free cathode catalyst by using nitrogen-doped CNTs obtained by CVD process. This cathode catalyst exhibited improved catalytic activity with no cyclophosphamide (CYC) toxicity toward SPCA-1 cells. Different materials used for fabricating fuel cell electrodes and their observed characteristics are presented in Table 2.2."

      "text" : "In this modern era, DSSC and QDSC are the most promising technologies in the field of solar cells due to their flexibility, ease of fabrication, and effectiveness in absorbing diffused sunlight. CNTs have been used in photoanodes of DSSC and QDSC due to their high specific surface area and enhanced charge transport (Chan et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2011a; Dembele et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2010a; Lee et al. 2008; Dang et al. 2011). MWCNTS/Si heterojunctions exhibited linear characteristics for a light-doped p-Si and a rectifying I–V behavior for high-doped p-Si (Hu et al. 1999; Kawano et al. 2006). Other such examples are SWCNTs which form Schottky contact on Si (Behnam et al. 2008), DWCNT/Si (Wei et al. 2007; Jia et al. 2008), and vertically aligned CNTs/Si, which exhibits rectifying characteristics (Tzolov et al. 2004a, b). N-GaAs also forms heterojunction with CNTs (Liang and Roth 2008). Researchers have investigated the role of carbon nanomaterials, like CNTs and graphene, in enhancing the performance of solar cells (Fan et al. 2008; Hong et al. 2008; Li and Mitra 2007; Somani et al. 2008; Xiao et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2008a; Li et al. 2015b).\nTiO2 is the most well-known photoanode used in DSSC, owing to its high specific surface area. However, the grain boundaries present in the porous structure of TiO2 impart entrapment of electrons, limiting the performance of TiO2 as a photoanode (Law et al. 2005; Joshi et al. 2010; Grätzel 2001). There are other drawbacks as well regarding the usage of TiO2 as a photocatalyst, such as (a) the slow rate of electron-hole recombination and the photoscattering of the material itself which limits its photoefficiency and (b) the very high bandgap for electron transition of the material which requires UV light. These drawbacks have necessitated exploitation of other materials which can be used either individually or in combination with TiO2. Recently, it has been demonstrated that coupling of CNTs\nwith semiconductors leads to an improvement in the efficiency of the photoanodes due to synergistic effect. Zhang et al. (2013) have reported that the conversion efficiency of a photoanode composite, composed of CNTs and porous TiO2 prepared by gel chapping method, is 2.6 times higher than TiO2 nanocrystalline films.\nThe liquid electrolyte used in DSSC suffers from evaporation and leaking. Hence, in order to overcome this challenge, solid and quasi-solid electrolytes are being used. These types of electrolytes involve polymers, gel electrolytes, ionic liquids, and conductors (Kumara et al. 2002; Papageorgiou et al. 1996; Wang et al. 2003; Longo et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2004; Murai et al. 2002). Introduction of CNTs in poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix, in the case of PEO/CNTs composite electrolyte, resulted in improving the performance of a solid-state DSSC in terms of conductivity and various other aspects (Akhtar et al. 2010). Ionic liquid-based polymer electrolyte, composed of PEO and 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (prepared by casting technique), used in DSSC has shown an energy conversion efficiency of 0.81% at 100 mWcm 2 (Singh et al. 2009). The short-circuit current density (JSC) for both the DSSC and the QDSC increased with the increasing concentration of CNTs, and the improvement was found to be more prominent for the QDSC (Golobostanfard and Abdizadeh 2015). Composites of molybdenum disulfide/ CNTs (MoS2/CNTs), prepared by glucose aided in situ hydrothermal route, have also been used as a catalyst for solar cells (Yue et al. 2013). It has been reported that the electrocatalytic behavior of the catalyst was improved in the presence of CNTs. The DSSC assembled with this novel electrode exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 7.92% under an illumination of 100 mWcm 2. This result was comparable to that obtained for the DSSC fabricated with a Pt electrode (i.e., a conversion efficiency of 7.11%). A novel photoanode was prepared by depositing a layer of TiO2-MWCNT nanocomposite on a mesoporous P25-TiO2 film, using layer-by-\nlayer deposition by spin coating with a compact sol-gel deposited TiO2 layer underneath. This novel photoanode produced a solar energy conversion of 7.0 0.3%, i.e., a 27% increase was obtained upon the addition of MWCNTs (Yao and Hang 2014). This improvement in the efficiency of the solar cell was attributed to the presence of MWCNTs, which was supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It was observed that CNTs exhibit p-type FET characteristic due to the adsorption of O2 layer which was facilitated by the transference of electron from oxygen to CNTs. However, spin coating a layer of aminebased polymer, like PEI, on the SWCNTs led to the formation of n-type SWCNTs (Yao and Hang 2014; Shim et al. 2001). Other heterojunctions based on CNTs include SWCNTs/SiC, CNF/SiC, single C/CNx-MWCNT, and BCN/C nanotube (Hu et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 1999; Kang et al. 2007).\nOrganic solar cells, consisting of polymers, possess flexibility, low cost, and ease of fabrication and are disposable. Polymers, like poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), are the most investigated materials in solar cells. Moreover, the work function (φ) of CNTs (i.e., 4.5–5.1 eV) is close to the valence band of P3OT/P3HT. CNTs help in providing transportation of holes and electrons by improving exciton dissociation (Kanai and Grossman 2008). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/CNTs composites have been utilized by Jia et al. as a substrate to deposit ZnSe thin film by using electrochemical atomic deposition (EC-ALD) (Jia et al. 2013) along with varying the proportion of Zn and Se (x¼ 0.33, 0.5, and 0.67). ZnSe was considered as a p-type semiconductor which possessed good solar energy absorption properties. PVA/MWCNT/PAni hydrogel has been recently investigated as an efficient material in DSSCs. This hydrogel was prepared by sandwiching gel electrolyte I /I3\nbetween FTO glass and Pt electrodes (Nath et al. 2014). This fabrication includes the in situ polymerization of PAni on the surface of PVA/MWCNTs composites, leading to the formation of a gel electrolyte. It was found that the electrical conductivity and the thermal stability of the gel electrolyte increased with increasing MWCNTs content. The diffusion impedance value decreased in PVA/MWCNTs owing to the restriction imposed on the ion migration in the electrolyte and the electrode. However, optimized addition of MWCNTs was found to help in increasing the surface area, which consequently improved the migration of ions (I /I3\n) in the electrolyte and the charge-transfer processes at the TiO2 and the Pt counter electrodes. At a high concentration of CNTs (1 wt%), the formation of a solid network of CNTs with counter electrode decreased the surface area available, thus restricting the charge transfer. It was further suggested from CV results (Fig. 2.12) that the peak current increased with increase in CNTs content, which eventually suggested that the catalytic activity of the electrode had increased.\nFigure 2.13 shows the working principle of CNT-based solar cells. It involves the use of CNTs as p-type semiconductor and silicon as n-type semiconductor, such that electron and hole transition can occur due to the establishment of a bandgap (Kumar et al. 2016). The emergence of solar energy leads to excite the holes in silicon, and electron transfer takes place from silicon to CNTs, and the photoenergy is stored in the batteries. Bai et al. have reported that “web-cob”-structured CNT/ZnO/TiO2 nanocomposite, prepared by hydrothermal process followed by acid treatment and\nultrasonication, exhibited high mechanical strength and improved photocatalytic efficiency to produce clean water with low-fouling properties (Bai et al. 2015).\nIt has been found that the type of CNT also influences the efficiency of solar cells, which can be evidenced from the difference from the efficiency values obtained (Abdullah et al. 2014). MWCNTs-ZnO-based DSSC possessed the highest longest electron lifetime and slowest electron diffusion as compared to ZnO and SWNTsZnO-based DSSC. Hollow CoFe2O4/CNTs composites prepared by hydrothermal process coupled with in situ CVD along with PPy showed good higher electrocatalytic performance than s-CoFe2O4, h-CoFe2O4, s-CoFe2O4/CNTs, and pure CNTs (Yuan et al. 2016a). Addition of PPy nanoparticles improved the conductivity of the h-CoFe2O4/CNTs/PPy-3 composites. CNT/TiO2 nanocomposites produced by sol-gel method exhibited high solar energy conversion of 5.23% at 750 C, and the value of photo-conversion efficiency was found to be\ndependent on annealing temperature (Razali et al. 2015). From XRD and SEM analysis, it was evidenced that the film of CNT/TiO2 nanocomposite was non-crackable, compact, and of high porosity. The annealing temperature of 750 C produced composites with the highest solar energy conversion. A hybrid colloidal quantum dot was prepared under ambient temperature using layer-by-layer deposition method and involves insertion of graphene layers in between multilayer stacks of PbS (Kim et al. 2016). It was postulated that the introduction of a graphene layer leads to an increase in power conversion efficiency by 9.18% with enhancement of current efficiency from 19.58 0.40 to 24.09 0.46 mAcm 2. Researchers have also used CNTs as a hole conductor in methyl ammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite solar cells instead of expensive hole-transporting materials (Li et al. 2016b). The efficiency of this tandem solar cell is further improved by PMMA coating on CNTs to 5.28%.\nGraphene possesses high specific surface area, strength, and inertness toward water vapor and oxygen and has thus found promising applications in solar cells (Wang et al. 2008b). A thin film of graphene was utilized as a window electrode for organic solar cells. This solar cell showed a Jsc value of 0.36 mAcm\n2, a Voc value of 0.38, an FF value of 0.25, and a η value of 0.29, under the influence of solar energy. Graphene composites with P3OT and P3HT have also exhibited significant efficiency improvement in organic solar cells (Liu et al. 2008b). Functionalized graphene was successfully applied as a new acceptor for solar cells with a configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS)/P3HT/graphene/LiF/Al (Liu et al. 2008a). This cell produced a Jsc value of 4 mAcm 2, a Voc value of 0.72 V, and a Z value of 1.1% at AM1.5. Wu et al. (2008) have reported the fabrication, as well as the performance of a novel cell consisting of graphene/copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag layered structure. This cell exhibited lower FF and Isc values than that of ITO. GO sheets with oxygen functionalities have shown good catalytic activity toward I /I3\nbut have low conductivity due to the presence of many lattice defects. GO sheets, when reduced by hydrazine, form rGO sheets. It has been postulated that rGO sheets showed a lower oxidation capability than GO at the same oxygen concentration (Mattevi et al. 2009; Roy-Mayhew et al. 2010). However, the intensive π-π interactions between graphene sheets lead to restacking (Yen et al. 2011). Researchers have reported that doping graphene with nitrogen influences the spatial electronic distribution of the attached carbon (“activation zone”), which affects the electrical conductivity and consequently helps in improving the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst (Groves et al. 2009; Zhang and Xia 2011). It has been further found that N-doping of CNTs requires high temperatures, whereas N-doping of graphene sheets can be achieved at low temperatures (Ju et al. 2013; Xue et al. 2012). N-doped graphene/CNTs composite on fluorine-doped SnO2 substrate, with a 3D “brick-like structure,” has been used as a counter electrode in solar cells (Ma et al. 2015). This counter electrode has produced a high efficiency of 6.74% as compared to Pt electrode (i.e., 6.89%), as well as good catalytic activity. It was further found that an increase in the ratio of graphene to CNTs led to an increase in the particle size and a decrease in the electrical conductivity. Studies confirmed that spider web CNTs,\nproduced by CVD process and embodied with continuous graphene sheet, led to improvement of the electrical conductivity of graphene in the presence of CNTs (Shi et al. 2015). Apart from this, the coexistence of CNT-Si and graphene-Si junctions resulted in the improvement of power conversion efficiency by 15.2% as compared to that obtained by using only graphene. Kavan et al. (2016) have discovered the use of an FTO and Pt-free graphene cathode for co-mediated dye-sensitized solar cells, in the presence of an acetonitrile-free electrolyte solution. It has been found that the diffusion coefficient of Co(bpy)3\n3+ is smaller in propionitrile mixed with sulfolane or with EMI TCB ionic liquid than in acetonitrile. Agresti et al. (2016) had recently studied the effect of 2D nanomaterials like graphene on the performance of perovskite solar cells. By applying graphene-doped mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transporting photoelectrode, a conversion efficiency of 18.2% was achieved. The photoanode used graphene oxide as the interlayer between perovskite and 2,20,7,7- 0-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,90-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole-transport layer (HTL). PEDOT:PSS nanocomposites with hybrid filler GO used for a perovskite solar cells produced higher photoenergy conversion than PEDOT:PSS nanocomposites. Moreover, UV-reduced PEDOT:PSS/GO nanocomposites showed higher efficiency than the PEDOT:PSS/GO nanocomposites. The presence of GO was inferred to improve the charge transport of the solar cells (Giuri et al. 2016). Graphene/Si solar cells prepared at room temperature led to an increase in photoenergy conversion from 5.95% to 13.02% by introducing a spiro-OMeTAD as an interlayer (p-type organic hole-transporting layer) for the solar cells (Xu et al. 2016).\nFurther studies revealed that incorporation of CNTs and graphene within conventional silicon wafers may lead to solar cells with improved power conversion efficiency, antireflection, and self-cleansing properties. The anti-reflectance property stems from the suppression of reflection of substrate due to suitable optical path difference (Li et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2005). On the other hand, the presence of a high fraction of entrapped air between arrays leads to self-cleansing properties of ARCs arrays. A photovoltaic cell, composed of silicon-PEDOT:PSS-CNT-poly(styrene), with a conversion efficiency of 8.7%, has been identified as an efficient ARC (Yu et al. 2015). Shi et al. (2012) have observed a 15% increase in the efficiency using TiO2 antireflective coating and CNTs doped with chemical oxidant. Different materials used for fabricating solar cell electrodes, the obtained efficiency and their associated significance, have been presented in Table 2.3."

      "text" : "The basic requirements for an electrode for advanced LiBs are (Yuan et al. 2016b) (a) high electrical conductivity (low electrical conductivity will diminish the operating voltage, power density, and energy density; moreover, incorporation of conductive additives leads to increase in weight of the electrodes. The full charge and discharge of Li-ion will be difficult owing to hindrance in transportation), (b) high\nsurface area (the availability of more surface area would lead to more active sites, enhancing the rate of surface reaction), and (c) microstructure of the electrode (the porous structure of the electrode also influences the performance and the efficiency of the electrode). A macroporous structure leads to efficient Li-ion diffusion and mass transfer, whereas a mesoporous structure shortens the distance for lithium transport. It has been suggested that in spite of providing high specific surface area, a significant section of it remains inaccessible to the electrolyte.\nResearchers investigated the role of carbon nanomaterials, like CNTs and graphene, in enhancing the performance of Li-ion batteries (Tao et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2006; Bak et al. 2011; Cao andWei 2013; Sivakumar and Kim 2007; Lian et al. 2010). It is well-established that CNTs may exist in three forms in the electrodes – discontinuous CNTs, CNT arrays, and binder-free CNT network. However, in most of the cases, the discontinuous CNTs are preferred for enhancing the performance of electrodes. Wu and coworkers have synthesized electrodes out of LFP/C/CNTs composites (Wu et al. 2013), such that the CNTs network can be efficiently used to decrease the internal resistance and thus enhancing the performance of the electrode. ZnFe2O4-C/LFP-CNT electrode had shown excellent performance even after 10,000 cycles (Varzi et al. 2014). Hou et al. (2013) have reported that Sn-filled CNTs electrode showed a capacity of 1000 mAhg 1 at a current density of 100 mAg 1. For example, Si/C/CNTs composites have been used as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. PEI has been used as a binder for Si/CNTs anode material. The electron donating group, i.e., imine, of PEI undergoes charge-transfer physisorption with the sidewalls of the CNTs (Bae et al. 2013). Additionally, incorporation of CNTs uniformly within the interspaces of graphite and silicon in Si/graphite/CNTs composites led to alleviation of the SEI formation (Li et al. 2015a). Addition of CNTs to lithium titanium oxide (LTO) resulted in an LTO/TiO2/C/CNTs composite\nwith improved electrochemical performance within a voltage window of 1.0–2.5 V (Wang et al. 2014). Fe3O4/CNTs composites, prepared by in situ filling of MWCNTs with ultrafine Fe3O4 nanoparticles, have exhibited remarkable improvement in capacity, cyclic stability, and performance as compared to commercial Fe3O4 as anode materials in Li-ion batteries (Gao et al. 2015). ZnSO4/CNTs composites have also been investigated as anode materials in which CNTs form a 3D electrically percolating network spanning within the ZnSO4 matrix (Qin et al. 2016). Studies have also focused on the SnSb alloy-coated MWCNTs synthesized by reductive precipitation process as an anode material (Park et al. 2007).\nGraphene finds application both as active material and as catalyst in metal-air batteries. As an active material, it may act as hosting ions or to store electrostatic charges for electrochemical double-layer capacitors. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is considered to be the most common material for Li-ion storage, and it exhibits high capacity values as compared to single-layer graphene (Vargas et al. 2012). However, this charge is not fully released during de-lithiation due to the irreversibility of the process. The efficiency of the RGO electrode also depends on the extent of defects in layers which are responsible for the low Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle. Holey graphene synthesized by ultrasonication and nitric acid etching of GO and followed by thermal exfoliation/reduction have been reported to increase the high rate performance of Li-ion batteries (Zhao et al. 2011). Solid hybrid polymer electrolytes, based on triethylsulfonium-bis (trifluorosulfonyl) imide (S2TFSI), PEO, and lithium TFSI, have exhibited a reversible cathodic stability more than 4.5 V along with long-term cycle stability against metallic lithium for Li-ion batteries (Fisher et al. 2011). Nowadays, graphene-based materials find application in ultrathin flexible Li-ion batteries with high charge mobility and good mechanical properties (Pushparaj et al. 2007; Mao et al. 2015). Graphene papers have found application as a conducting agent and also as a current collector. Graphene composites with high specific surface area, high conductivity, and high mechanical properties, along with high lithium storage capacity (744 mAhg 1), have also found application as anode materials (Rao et al. 2012). LiFePO4/graphene nanocomposites prepared by sol-gel method (used as a cathode) have been observed to possess electrical conductivity six times higher than that of pure LiFePO4, along with improved rate capability and cyclic stability (Dhindsa et al. 2013). SEM micrographs have revealed that each particle of LiFePO4 is surrounded by graphene, forming a 3D network for efficient electrical conductivity. Graphene-coated SnO2 has exhibited improved cycling stability owing to the addition of graphene (Zhu et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2014). Zhang et al. (2014c) have also studied in situ Li+ storage capacity enhancement of MnO nanowire/GNS composites, along with improved electrochemical performance. This self-enhancement has been attributed to the strong interphase interaction between MnO and graphene flakes. GNS acts as a buffering agent for the Sn-based electrode and helps in relieving the stress during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, the functionalities present on the surface of GNS act as a 2D substrate, assisting the anisotropic growth of Sn-based material. Sn/graphene nanocomposites, synthesized by a combination of a microwave hydrothermal and one-step hydrogen gas reduction\nprocesses, have found application as anodes for Li-ion batteries (Chen et al. 2012b). Sn particles having a size range of 10–20 nm exhibited higher capacity and cycle stability as compared to an anode comprised of Sn particles having a size range of 60–120 nm. Recently, graphene-based magnesium-ion batteries have also been reported. Although the electrochemical properties of this battery were poor, still it is the first attempt to use graphene as cathode materials in magnesium-ion batteries (Wang et al. 2013b). Moreover, graphene also improved the efficiency of vanadium redox-flow batteries (VRFBs) (Weber et al. 2011). It has also been studied that the performance of rutile TiO2 nanoneedle/graphene composites with a combination of 1D and 2D properties possessed a unique microstructure which is responsible for its outstanding electrochemical properties. The 1D structure of rutile TiO2 shortens the Li-ion transportation pathway, improving the diffusion rate, while the 2D structure of graphene nanosheet imparts good electrical conductivity to the electrode (Gan et al. 2015). Different materials used for fabricating electrodes of Li-ion batteries and their performance details are presented in Table 2.4. Currently, scientists have focused on a new type of commercialized Na-S batteries, and with a mere change in their structural and mechanical design, low-cost devices for grid storage application and redox-flow batteries can be produced (Dunn et al. 2011). It is now recognized that this type of new battery technology is going to replace the existing Li-ion battery technology.\nRenewable sources of energy will be able to replenish nonrenewable sources of energy to satisfy the various needs of society. However, there are barriers to the commercialization of renewable energy storage devices. In order to overcome the barriers to commercialization of projects related to nonrenewable energy, financial strategies require flexibility and innovation. The factors that affect the commercialization of renewable energy technologies are as follows: high capital for operation and maintenance costs, high project development to investment cost ratio, small total investment requirement, inaccurate perception of risk, difficulty guaranteeing project cash flow, weak basis for nonrecourse financing, and weak project developers. In the present scenario, 80% of the world’s energy consumption is supplied by fossil fuels because of their low cost and high availability. However, in recent years, the cost advantage of renewable sources of energy is increasing over that of fossil fuels (Timmons et al. 2014). Moreover, it is expected that the prices of renewable sources are going to decrease with the passage of time, and hence, it can be inferred that financial strategies will lead to incline the research trends toward renewable energy sources. Researchers have studied the process-based cost model (PBCM) along with the design of experiments to analyze the economy of the batteries. It was revealed that the cost of MWCNTs and process yield have a profound effect on the unit cost for satellite batteries, whereas the unit cost of a computer depends on the process yield and cycle time (Hakimian et al. 2015). It was shown that the addition of CNTs increases the charge and discharge cycle for Li-ion batteries which essentially help decrease cycle time for CNT-based batteries. As the specific energy, battery life, and run-time increase, the overall cost of production also increases due to incorporation of MWCNTs in the batteries."

      "text" : "The upsurge in the requirement for clean and renewable energy for the next generation of sustainable society led to the development of new advanced energy storage devices, like supercapacitors, fuel cells, solar cells, and Li-ion batteries. Carbon nanomaterials, like CNTs and graphene, and even conducting polymers have been able to secure a significant position in order to meet diverse applications in the field of energy storage devices. However, there exist a great deal of difficulties in scaling up and commercializing these energy production and storage devices with the inclusion of nanomaterials. Therefore, recent research has been focused to improve the efficiency and performance of these devices using CNTs and graphene. CNTs- and graphene-based conducting polymer composites are considered to be a potential candidate for future generation solar cells. These polymer composites are flexible and low cost and can be easily produced; however, the acceptor-donor problem in the case of conducting polymers is currently restricting their application in solar cells. The efficient photon-absorbing capacity, capability to generate photocarriers, good photovoltaic properties, and their ability to separate charge carriers to form heterojunctions with conducting polymers make CNTs and graphene ideal candidates for application in solar cells. Supercapacitors have high power densities; however, their energy densities are lower compared to conventional batteries. The capacitance of a supercapacitor has been found to not only depend on the specific surface area of CNTs but also on several other factors, such as synthesis of CNTs, pore size, pore size distribution, and posttreatment of CNTs. This chapter also described the use of carbon nanostructured materials as supporting matrices for catalysts or even as catalysts for several types of fuel cells. It has also been found that carbon nanomaterials play a significant role in producing electrodes for Li-ion batteries. High electron conductivity and high surface area of these nanomaterials lead to improved rate capability and charge storage. It can be assumed that owing to all the abovementioned outstanding properties of CNTs and graphene, they represent ideal candidates for fabricating such challenging devices. However, the high cost of these materials is still limiting their commercial application. Therefore, reduction in materials and production costs should be achieved in order to attain fruitful market penetration for these prospective energy storage devices.\nAcknowledgments KD is thankful to the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) [Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India] and the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) for the Indo-US Postdoctoral Fellowship (Award No. 2017/8- Kingshuk Dutta)."

Over the last decades, attempts have been taken to use nanostructured carbon-based materials, like graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with the aim of improving the efficiency of the abovementioned energy storage systems. In this book chapter, focus has been directed toward the recent progress and advancement on the efficiency of the electrode materials of these renewable energy storage systems via application of CNTs, graphene, or nanohybrid fillers. The ability of these materials to exhibit superior capacity toward photon absorption, capability toward generation of photocarriers, photovoltaic properties, and separation of charge carriers to form heterojunctions makes them ideal applicants in solar cells. The capacitance of a supercapacitor varied with the specific surface area, synthetic approach, pore size, pore size distribution, and posttreatment of these materials. Moreover, high electron conductivity and high surface area of these nanomaterials led to improvements in (a) electrode reaction rates in fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors and (b) charge storage capability of supercapacitors and lithium-",
