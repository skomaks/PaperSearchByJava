The presentwork aimed to clarify the effects of 96h exposure to 4, 80 and1600 μg·L−1 of 7 nmgoldnanoparticles (AuNPs) – (citrate coated (cAuNPs) or polyvinylpyrrolidone coated (PVP-AuNPs)) – and ionic Au (iAu) ongilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Effects at different levels of biological organization (behaviour, neurotransmission, biotransformation, oxidative stress/damage and genotoxicity)were assessed. cAuNPs induced oxidative stress and damage (lipid peroxidation increase), even at 4 μg·L−1, and reduced the ability of S. aurata to swim against a water flow at 1600 μg·L−1. Exposure to cAuNPs induced more adverse effects than exposure to PVPAuNPs. All tested concentrations of Au (nano or ionic form) induced DNA breaks and cytogenetic damage in erythrocytes of S. aurata. Generally, iAu induced significantly more effects in fish than the nano form, probably associatedwith the significantly higher accumulation in thefish tissues. Nofishmortalitywas observed following exposure to AuNPs, but mortality was observed in the group exposed to 1600 μg·L−1 of iAu.\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Throughout its history, gold (Au) has been recognized as an inert, non-toxic and biocompatible noble metal with therapeutic properties (Daniel and Astruc, 2004; Fratoddi et al., 2015). However, when Au decreases to nanometer dimensions, the safety of the resulting nanomaterials has been questioned (Boverhof et al., 2015). Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely used in medicine and biological research (Fratoddi et al., 2015), including targeted delivery of drugs (Ghosh et al., 2008), imaging and diagnosis (Bhattacharya and Mukherjee, 2008). Its application in aquaculture as antimicrobial agent (Saleh et al., 2016) and to detect contaminants (Loganathan and John, 2017) has also been investigated. Despite the widespread use of AuNPs and consequent release to the environment, there is a limited understanding of their consequences for environmental health (Barreto et al., 2019a; Barreto et al., 2019b; Iswarya et al., 2016; Na-Phatthalung et al., 2018; Teles et al., 2016). In addition, the question of whether AuNPs are more toxic than ionic Au (iAu) remains unresolved (Barbasz and Oćwieja, 2016; Botha et al., 2015; Dedeh et al., 2015; Farkas et al., 2010; Luis et al., 2016). Table 1 presents the example of several in vitro and in vivo studies where different toxicity outputs were achieved.\nThus, the aim of the present study was to add value to the shortage of studies available comparing both Au forms and to investigate the effects of Au on the top predator Sparus aurata after 96 h exposure to 7 nm AuNPs (citrate coated (cAuNPs) or polyvinylpyrrolidone coated (PVP-AuNPs)) and iAu. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first one testing the effects of both forms of Au to a marine fish. AuNPs of small size were chosen due to the reported highest effects attributed to small sizes (Coradeghini et al., 2013; Iswarya et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2017). Two coatings of AuNPs were tested to clarify whether they determine the effects of AuNPs in the fish. Swimming performance, the activity of enzymes involved in neurotransmission (cholinesterases – ChE), in biotransformation (glutathione S-transferases – GST) and antioxidant defence (glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), non-enzymatic defence (non-protein thiols – NPT), oxidative damage (in DNA and cellular membranes), DNA strand breaks and nuclear abnormalities were assessed. The concentration of Au was also quantified in relevant tissues (gills, liver, spleen and muscle). The main specific aims were: 1) to clarify which Au form is more toxic and bioaccumulative to this marine fish (nano versus ionic); and 2) to clarify the effect of coating in the AuNPs toxicity (cAuNPs versus PVP-AuNPs)."

It is an excellent coating agent, especially for noble metals NPs (Das et al., 2017; Min et al., 2009). This polymer is frequently used as AuNPs coating agent to increase its stability and to promote biological interactions (Min et al., 2009).

To prevent oxidation, the aliquot of homogenate for LPO evaluation was transferred to a microtube with 4% BHT (2,6-di-tertbutyl-4-methylphenol) inmethanol. The aliquots for LPO andNPT levels determination were stored at −80 °C until analysis.

      "text" : "The alkaline comet assay was conducted according to the method of Singh et al. (1988) with some adaptations, as previously described by Barreto et al. (2017). The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was improved by the incubation of the lysed cells (nucleoids) with a lesionspecific endonuclease, formamidopyrimidine DNA glycoslyase (Fpg). Fpg was chosen because it is a protein recommended for the detection of oxidative DNA base damage, in particular 8-OH guanine, as well as other damaged purines and abasic sites (AP sites) and ring-opened N7 guanine adducts (Albertini et al., 2000; Epe et al., 1993; Li et al., 1997; Speit et al., 2004; Tchou et al., 1994; Tice et al., 2000; Tudek et al., 1998). The method for enzyme Fpg conjugated with comet assay was performed according to procedures previously reported (Collins, 2014; Collins et al., 1997). Two replicate comet slides were made for each blood sample; one slide was treated with Fpg and the other without Fpg. A positive control (fish blood treatedwith 25 μMhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 10 min), with and without Fpg treatment, was also included in the assay. H2O2 is a recognized genotoxic agent, producing both strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage (Barreto et al., 2017; Termini, 2000). After the lysis step, for the enzyme treatment, the correspondent slides were removed from lysis buffer and were washed 3 times in cold (4 °C) enzymatic buffer solution (40 mM HEPES; 0.1 M KCl; 0.5 mM EDTA; 0.2 mg.mL−1 bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0). Fpg (45 μL, 1:60 diluted in enzymatic buffer solution) was added to the slides, which were individually sealed with a coverslip and incubated during 30 min at 37 °C. The other steps involved in the comet assay were common to slides with or without Fpg. Cells were classified according to tail length, into five classes (Collins, 2004): class 0 – undamaged, without a tail; class 1 – with a tail shorter than the diameter of the nucleus; class 2 –with a tail length 1–2 times the diameter of the nucleus; class 3 – with a tail longer than twice the diameter of the nucleus; class 4 – comets with no nucleus. A damage index (DI), in arbitrary units, was assigned to each slide (for 100 cells) and consequently for each treatment, using the formula:\nDI ¼ 0 n0ð Þ þ 1 n1ð Þ þ 2 n2ð Þ þ 3 n3ð Þ þ 4 n4ð Þ\nwhere: n=number of cells in each class. DI can range from 0 to 400 (de Andrade et al., 2004).\nTheDNA damage index in cells treatedwith Fpgwith the correspondent cells without the enzymatic treatment was compared to detect possible DNA oxidative damage.\nThe ENAs assay was carried out in mature peripheral erythrocytes according previous procedures and nuclear lesions were scored as micronuclei, lobed, segmented, kidney-shaped and vacuolated nuclei (Barreto et al., 2017; Pacheco and Santos, 1996). Resultswere expressed as the ENAs frequency (‰) to each replicate (for 1000 cells) and consequently for each treatment using the formula:\nENAs ‰ð Þ ¼ Number of cells containing ENAs Total number of cells counted\n2.5. Gold (Au) quantification\nThe determination of Au in the stock suspensions, in the experimental media and fish tissues was performed according to the NIST NCL Method PCC-8 (NIST, 2010). An iCAP™ Q ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for the analysis. The ICP-MS instrumental conditions were as follow: argon flow rate (14 L·min−1); auxiliary argon flow rate (0.8 L·min−1); nebulizer flow rate (1.03 mL·min−1); RF power (1550 W) and dwell time (100 ms). The elemental isotope 197Au was monitored for analytical determination; 159Tb and 209Bi were used as internal standards. The instrument was tuned daily for\nmaximum signal sensitivity and stability. More information about Au quantification can be found in the study of Barreto et al. (2019b).\nStock suspensions theoretical concentrations and number of nanoparticles (NPs) were also estimated based on their UV–Vis spectra and sizes (Barreto et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2007; Paramelle et al., 2014)."

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed an average hydrodynamic size of the particles of 7 nm and a strongly negative surface charge (−43 mV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed that almost all cAuNPs presented spherical shape and the particles had similar sizes between them (Fig. 1B). Therewas a slight shift in the SPR peak to a longerwavelength for PVP-AuNPs (521 nm) when compared with cAuNPs (519 nm). DLS measurements showed a size of around 8 nm and a less negative ZP than cAuNPs (−13 mV). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis allowed the visualization of a PVP layer around some AuNPs metal core (Fig. 1C).\nIn the experimental media (ASW), 80 and 1600 μg·L−1 cAuNPs changed the colour from red to light blue, as a result of NPs agglomeration/aggregation, whereas PVP-AuNPs did not show colour alteration. At 4 μg·L−1, it was not possible to detect any colour change. Moreover, the hydrodynamic size of cAuNPs (1600 μg·L−1) in ASW at 0 h increased to around 160 nm, maintaining this size till the end of the test (96 h) – Table 2. The characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak detected in ultrapure water was not detected in ASW (Table 2). Additionally, different peaks corresponding to different charges were found in the zeta potential (ZP) analysis of the cAuNPs in ASW. Within 24 h, in the aquaria containing 1600 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs, a dark layer was visible as a consequence of the sedimentation of the NPs aggregates/agglomerates. PVP-AuNPs (1600 μg·L−1) in ASW had similar characteristics (e.g. hydrodynamic size, UV–Vis spectra and ZP) as the PVP-AuNPs in ultrapure water (Table 2). At 4 and 80 μg·L−1, it was not possible characterise the AuNPs because of the detection limits of the techniques used.\n3.2. Gold (Au) quantification in experimental media\nAuNPs theoretical concentration versus measured concentrations (by ICP-MS) and the number of particles present in the AuNPs stock suspensions are shown in Table S1. The nominal versus measured concentrations of Au in the experimental media are presented in Table 3.\nAt 0 h, the Au quantified in ASW, in general, was lower than the nominal concentrations, with exception to 4 μg·L−1 of PVP-AuNP and iAu (4 and 80 μg·L−1). The difference between the nominal and measured concentrations was more noticeable in the case of the exposures to cAuNPs (Table 3). With the increasing cAuNPs concentration, the difference between the nominal and measured concentration of Au also\nparticles – cAuNPs (B) and scanning electron microscopy image of polyvinylpyrrolidone\nincreased. For the nominal concentration of 4 μg·L−1 cAuNPs, the measured concentration of Au was 41% lower than the expected. For PVPAuNPs and iAu, the determined concentrations of Au were 88 and 78% higher than the expected, respectively. For the 80 μg·L−1 treatment, the detected concentrations of Au in ASW were 70 and 38% lower than the nominal concentrations, after cAuNPs and PVP-AuNPs exposures, respectively. For 80 μg·L−1 of iAu, the measured concentration of Auwas 16% higher than the expected. At 1600 μg·L−1, the concentration of Auwas 84, 16 and 14% lower than the expected for cAuNPs, PVPAuNPs and iAu, respectively. The levels of Au at 0 and 24 h decreased more for cAuNPs than PVP-AuNPs (Table 3). In the nominal concentration 4 μg·L−1, an Au decrease of 33 and 15% was found for cAuNPs and PVP-AuNPs, respectively. Concerning iAu, the measured concentration at 0 hwas similar to themeasured at 24 h. In the nominal concentration 80 μg·L−1, after 24 h of exposure, the concentrations of Au decreased by 71, 23 and 4% for cAuNPs, PVP-AuNPs and iAu, respectively. For the nominal concentration 1600 μg·L−1, a decrease of Au concentration after 24 h was also observed with 61% for cAuNPs, 15% for PVP-AuNPs and 6% for iAu.\n3.3. Biological responses of fish after exposure to gold (Au)\nAfter 24 h of exposure, one fish died in the 1600 μg·L−1 iAu treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, the ability of Sparus aurata to continue swimming against a water flow was significantly decreased (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test) when fish were exposed to 1600 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs and iAu.\nChE activity in brain and muscle was not significantly altered by the exposure to the both forms of Au (p N 0.05; ANOVA; Fig. 3).\nConcerning the enzymatic antioxidant defence, iAu (4 and 1600 μg·L−1) significantly increased gills CAT activity (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 4A), whereas, liver CAT activity was not significantly affected by the exposure to both forms of Au (p N 0.05; ANOVA; Fig. 4B). PVP-AuNPs, at 80 μg·L−1, significantly decreased the gills CAT activity (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 4A).\nGR activity in gills was significantly increased after exposure to 1600 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 5A) whereas in the liver, GR activity was significantly increased by 80 and 1600 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 5B).

In the liver, 80 μg·L−1 of PVP-AuNPs decreased the GPx activity (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 6B).\nConcerning the non-enzymatic antioxidant defence, all tested concentrations of cAuNPs and 1600 μg·L−1 of iAu significantly increased gills NPT levels (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 7A). In liver, only 1600 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs significantly increased the levels of NPT (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 7B).\ncAuNPs (4 μg·L−1) and iAu (1600 μg·L−1) significantly increased gills GST activity (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 8A). In liver, 1600 μg·L−1 iAu significantly increased the activity of this enzyme (p N 0.05; ANOVA; Fig. 8B).\nAs shown in Fig. 9A, oxidative damage (assessed as TBARS levels) was found in gills after the exposure to all tested concentrations of cAuNPs (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test). In liver, LPO levels significantly increased after the exposure to 1600 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 9B).\nIncrease of LPO levels was also detected in brain following exposure to 4 and 80 μg·L−1 of iAu (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 10A) and inmuscle after the exposure to 80 μg·L−1 of iAu (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test; Fig. 10B).\nAll the treatments induced genotoxic effects (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test), assessed by DNA strand breakage – Table 4.

In terms of damage classes, as shown in Table 4, the most abundant classes in the negative control group were class 0 and 1. Class 2 was the most detected in the exposures to 4 μg·L−1 and classes 2 and 3 in the exposures to 80 μg·L−1 (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test). At 1600 μg·L−1, Au exposures induced a DNA damage classified, mostly, in classes 3 and 4 (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test). No significant oxidative DNA damage was found (p N 0.05; ANOVA). Comparing the DNA damage index in cells treated with Fpg with the correspondent cells without the enzymatic treatment, no significant differences were found (p N 0.05; ANOVA) – Table 4. However, comparing the DNA damage index in cells treated with H2O2 with and without treatment with Fpg, in the cells with Fpg the DNA damage index was significantly higher than those without Fpg (p b 0.05; Tukey's test).\nAll the treatments, with the exception to 4 μg·L−1 of cAuNPs and iAu, led to significantly higher ENAs frequency (p b 0.05; Dunnett's\ntest), as shown in Fig. 11. The frequency of ENAs increased with the increase of Au concentration (both forms).\nAs shown in Table 5, the lobed nuclei abnormality was the most commonly detected in all the treatments, followed by kidney-shaped nuclei (p b 0.05; Dunnett's test). The segmented, micronuclei and vacuolated nuclei abnormalities were the less detected – Table 5."

      "text" : "The coating of 7 nm AuNPs with PVP resulted in a slight shift in the SPR peak to a longer wavelength when compared with the original cAuNPs as previously observed for the same AuNPs (Barreto et al., 2015). DLS measurements showed an increased size of PVP-AuNPs and a less negative ZP valuewhen comparedwith cAuNPs, also in agreement with a previous study (Barreto et al., 2015). The detected size difference may be explained by the fact that PVP presenting a larger size than citrate (Iswarya et al., 2016; Tejamaya et al., 2012). In terms of ZP, the observed difference between cAuNPs and PVP-AuNPs may be explained by the fact that PVP is an uncharged molecule thus making the PVP-AUNPs less negative than cAuNPs (Mahl et al., 2010). In the\nexperimental media (ASW), 80 and 1600 μg·L−1 cAuNPs changed the colour, as a result of NPs agglomeration/aggregation. PVP-AuNPs, at 80 and 1600 μg·L−1, did not show colour alteration in ASW. These results are in agreement with the previous study of Barreto et al. (2015) which demonstrated that 7 nm PVP-AuNPs were stable in ASW for N30 days. Thus, the present study confirmed that PVP-AuNPs may remain stable in suspension in a nano size range in ASW,whereas cAuNPs immediately alter their characteristics and aggregate/agglomerate, increasing their size to N100 nm. These characteristics and behaviour of different AuNPs may influence their accumulation and effects to the organisms. NPs size may affect its bioavailability to the organisms. When aggregates become too large for direct transport across the cell membrane, uptake may be prevented (Vale et al., 2016).\nAlthough the stability of the tested AuNPs was different in ASW, no significant differences were found in terms of Au accumulation in the tissues of S. aurata after the exposure to cAuNPs and PVP-\nxposure to gold nanoparticles (citrate coated – cAuNPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated – ferences to control (Dunnett's test, p b 0.05). Different letters correspond to significant 0.05). Different numbers correspond to significant differences between each treatment\nAuNPs. Another interesting result was the highest BAF in the spleen calculated for the lowest nominal concentration exposure of cAuNPs (4 μg·L−1). This may be due to the lower aggregation/agglomeration processes, with higher ability of Au entering in the tissues (Barreto et al., 2019a). As already reported, aggregation/agglomeration is expected to increase with the increase in the number of particles per volume (Barreto et al., 2015). Therefore, since cAuNPs, at the highest tested concentrations (80 and 1600 μg·L−1), are more likely to aggregate/agglomerate, they are less available for the uptake by fish. The detected accumulation of Au in the spleen of S. aurata (although not significantly) show the potential role of the spleen in Au elimination. Despite the lack of Au accumulation after the exposure to AuNPs, particles were bioactive to S. aurata. The present data reveal that 7 nm cAuNPs induced more pronounced effects, in terms of oxidative stress and damage responses, than PVP-AuNPs. This result was unexpected considering the stability of the particles, despite the fact that PVP coating is considered safer and more biocompatible\nFig. 8.Gills (A) and liver (B) glutathione S-transferases (GST) activity of Sparus aurata after 96 h PVP-AuNPs) and ionic gold.

The 7 nm PVP-AuNPs remained stable in ASW, dispersed in the water column and, therefore, more available for the uptake by fish. An opposite pattern was previously observed for 40 nm AuNPs with PVP-AuNPs inducing more adverse effects than cAuNPs to S. aurata (Barreto et al., 2019b). However, a previous study, where different organisms were tested (bacteria, algae, SiHa cell line and mice), also showed that cAuNPs had more adverse effects than PVP-AuNPs (Iswarya et al., 2016). Wang et al. (2011) reported that the toxicity of AuNPs is related to the co-existence of citrate and Au3+ ions. When NPs are coated with PVP, there is an absence of reactive citrate ions on the surface of AuNPs. In the present study, the tested concentrations of cAuNPs decreased the swimming resistance, induced enzymatic and non-enzymatic responses involved in the oxidative defence/ damage and genotoxicity in fish. Therefore, it seems that the formed agglomerates/aggregates in the ASW (b200 nm) may be incorporated through the cellular membranes.\nexposure to gold nanoparticles (citrate coated – cAuNPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated – ences to control (Dunnett's test, p b 0.05). Different letters correspond to significant differfferent numbers correspond to significant differences between each treatment within the\nComparing the ionic with the nano form, Au significantly accumulated in almost all assessed tissues of S. aurata after the exposure to 1600 μg·L−1 iAu, whereas after the exposure to AuNPs, Au did not significantly accumulate. Despite the significantly higher effects of cAuNPs in some endpoints (such as gills GPx and liver GR activities, gills NPT and gills/liver LPO levels), even at the lowest tested concentration (i.e., 4 μg L−1), iAu induced, in general, more effects on the fish (gills CAT, GR and liver GST activities and muscle/brain LPO levels). Additionally, no fish mortality was detected after the exposures with AuNPs, whereas one fish died after the exposure to 1600 μg·L−1 of iAu. The results demonstrated a tissue specificity, cAuNPs induced LPO in gills and liver, while iAu induced LPO in brain and muscle. There are few available studies about the mechanisms involved in the toxicity of iAu. Nonetheless, the iAu ability to undergo redox reactions with peptides and proteins, particularly involving sulphur amino acids, to deprotonate and bind to peptide amide bonds and cross-link histidine imidazole rings, has been already reported (Best and Sadler, 1996; Luis et al., 2016). Some authors, using in vitro tests, reported that iAu induced effects to mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) whereas the nano form did not have any effect (Farkas et al., 2010; Luis et al., 2016). Botha et al. (2015), using different aquatic species (daphnia and fish), also showed that iAu was more toxic than nano form. However, Barbasz and Oćwieja (2016), using two types of human cell lines, showed a higher cytotoxicity of\nAuNPs than iAu. Dedeh et al. (2015) described that, in spite of iAu having accumulated more in the tissues of zebrafish (Danio rerio) than the AuNPs, the latter had more effects on the fish, in terms of gene expression and neurotransmission.\nIn terms of genotoxicity, all the treatments induced DNA strand breaks, assessed by comet assay, in S. aurata peripheral blood cells. Concerning cytogenetic damage, ENAs frequency increased with the increase of Au concentration (nano or ionic form). A previous study also showed the potential genotoxicity of 40 nm AuNPs (both PVP-AuNPs and cAuNPs) to S. aurata (Barreto et al., 2019a). Comet assay is a rapid method to detect low levels of DNA damage. However, this technique gives limited information about the kind of DNA damage, if it is a direct consequence of the damaging agent or indirect effects, such as oxidative damage, apurinic/pyrimidinic sites or DNA repair (Smith et al., 2006). As previously described, the genotoxic effects of AuNPs may be caused directly following the entry of NPs into the nuclei, binding to DNA; or indirectly, through oxidative stress, whichmay consequently induce DNA oxidative damage (Auffan et al., 2009; Barreto et al., 2019a; Cardoso et al., 2014). The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following AuNPs exposure has been demonstrated in studies involving aquatic organisms (Farkas et al., 2010; Tedesco et al., 2008, 2010; Pan et al., 2012). Modification of the comet assaywith the incorporation of lesion specific endonucleases, such as Fpg, increases its sensitivity and specificity through the recognition of damaged bases and introduction of additional breaks (Azqueta et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2006; Speit et al., 2004). The present study showed that Au (nano and ionic form) induced DNA breaks, but oxidative DNA damage was not observed. This result was previously described in studies with different types of NPs (Ag, CeO2, Co3O4 and SiO2) and metal ions (Al3+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) (Grin et al., 2009; Kain et al., 2012) and may be due to: 1) the low potential of the tested conditions to induce oxidative damage on the erythrocyte DNA of S. aurata, which is not supported by the LPO data; 2) the oxidative DNA lesions caused by the exposure to Au may have been already been repaired by cellular DNA repair systems (Catalán et al., 2014); 3) NPs and ionic forms may interact with Fpg, not allowing the binding of the enzyme with DNA (Asmuss et al., 2000; Kain et al., 2012).\nOverall, after Au exposures, enzymatic and non-enzymatic responses involved in the defence of S. aurata against oxidative damage weremore activated in the gills than in the liver. Additionally, oxidative damage (LPO increase) wasmore clearly expressed in gills than in liver. Gills are the first organ to be exposed and provide a large surface area for contaminants such as AuNPs, being considered a good candidate to an early assessment of the effects of waterborne contaminants (Oliveira et al., 2008).\nSince S. aurata is one of the most consumed fish in south Europe, an estimation of Au intake by humans via food chain is an important assessment (Barreto et al., 2019b). The highest estimated value for Au intake by each Portuguese person (1.10 μg·kg body weight per year)\nnanoparticles (citrate coated– cAuNPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated– PVP-AuNPs) and an± standard error.

Based on the tested conditions and present results, the estimated maximum Au intake by humans per day was around 0.003 μg·kg−1 body weight. So, this value did not exceed the estimated TDI value for Au (322 μg·kg−1). Future studies should carry out the assessment of Au intake by humans via food chain since AuNPs use is increasingworldwide and thus it is expected to find increased concentration of them in the environment."

      "text" : "The present results showed that short-term exposure to gold (nano or ionic form), at low levels such as 4 μg·L−1, was able to induce oxidative stress and damage, as well as genotoxicity to the marine/estuarine fish Sparus aurata. Citrate coated gold nanoparticles (cAuNPs), even aggregating/agglomerating in seawater, induced significantly more effects to fish (oxidative stress and damage) than the polyvinylpyrrolidone coated gold nanoparticles (PVPAuNPs), which maintained its nano size in seawater. The exposures to ionic gold resulted in higher accumulation in the fish tissues and induced more effects to fish than nano form. After gold exposures, responses involved in fish defence against oxidative damage were more activated in the gills than in the liver. Furthermore, oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation increase) was more detected in gills than in the liver. The results showed that gold (nano and ionic form) is not inert and a distinct response was found in the assessed tissues. Further chronic tests must be performed to complement the present findings.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137026."
