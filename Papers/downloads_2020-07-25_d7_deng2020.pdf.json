Magnetic nanomaterials have unique properties such as extremely large surface area per volume substance and strong magnetic response. It is very easy for them to be isolated from complicated matrixes, only by applying external magnets. The possibilities for surface functionalization make them exciting candidates for enantioseparation. Functionalized magnetic nanomaterials are unique tools for the simple and rapid enantioseparation compared with traditional chiral stationary phase. In this review, various magnetic nanomaterials modified with specific chiral selectors are reviewed in this manuscript. The prepared functional magnetic materials are typically used as chiral adsorbents for enantioseparation applications, formatted by methods of dispersive solid phase extraction, enantioselective crystallization, or column and microchip separation.\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Chirality is a widespread phenomenon in nature and organisms [1,2]. Notably, a number of compounds related to life healthy including chiral drugs, amino acids (AAs), carbohydrates, nucleic acids and proteins are chiral. Interestingly, enantiomers of chiral compounds are mirror images to each other and have nearly identical physical and chemical properties in a symmetric environment. However, in a stereospecific biological environment, such as the human body, profoundly different effects in metabolism pathway, pharmacological activity, therapeutic effect and toxicity have often been exhibited for enantiomers [3,4]. Obtaining enantiomerically pure compounds is therefore of significant importance, but remains highly challenging. Very few enantiopure compounds can be obtained from natural sources. On the other hand, enantioselective synthesis is still restricted to the use of enantiomeric pure substrates, auxiliary or catalysts, albeit tremendous advance has been achieved in asymmetric synthesis [5]. Therefore, research on specific chiral selectors along with\nseparation techniques continues to be conducted to resolve individual enantiomers.\nChiral separation has been under development for several decades, and the racemic approach is mainly based on a three-point interaction between the analyte and the chiral selector [6]. Briefly, this theory posits that the fundamental basis for distinction of enantiomers is transformation of enantiomers to diastereomers or creation of a diastereomeric relationship between ligated enantiomers and chiral selector. Many efficient chiral selectors with multiple interaction sites, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), polysaccharide, proteins, AAs, cellulose and their derivatives, have been developed. Unfortunately, there is no universal chiral selector that can efficiently recognize or separate of all of the chiral compounds till date. Dynamic polymer interfaces, supramolecular assemblies, and metal-organic frameworks (MOF), have also been investigated or synthesized with high chiral discrimination ability, which allows for the potential development of new, sustainable and efficient chiral selector materials. At the same time, numbers of techniques have been developed for the recognition or separation of enantiomers. The most commonly used method is chromatography which mainly includes high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), gas chromatography (GC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and thin-layer chromatography\nAbbreviations\nAAs amino acids Bdc 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid Bpy bipyridine BSA bovine serum albumin BTC 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid CAM camphoric acid CBDMPC cellulose-2,3-bis(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) CDs cyclodextrins CDMPC cellulose tris(3,5- dimethylphenylcarbamate) CE capillary electrophoresis CEC capillary electrochromatography CM-b-CD carboxymethyl-b-CD CTMB cellulose tris-(4-methylbenzoate) CuDBH [Cu(D-mal)(bpy)]$H2O CuLBH [Cu(L-mal)(bpy)]$H2O Cys cysteine DMA N,N-dimethylacetamide DMF N, N-dimethylformamide e.e. enantiomeric excesses GC gas chromatography GO graphene oxide HPLC high performance liquid chromatography HAS human serum albumin Lac lactic acid Mal malic acid MA mandelic acid MCE microchip electrophoresis MIP molecularly imprinted polymer\nMMWCNT multi-wall carbon nanotube mNBF magnetic-nanobiofluids mNC-GPE magneto nanocomposite graphene paste electrode MNPs magnetic nanoparticles MOFs metal-organic frameworks NPs nanoparticles OT-CEC open tubular CEC PA polyacetylene PAMAM polyamidoamine PDA polydopamine PDMS polydimethylsiloxane Phe phenylalanine PHY a-phenylglycine PNE polynorepinephrine PNCD poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-maleic anhydride-bCD PNG poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycidyl methacrylate) SFC supercritical fluid chromatography TE teicoplanin TLC thin-layer chromatography Thr threonine Trp tryptophan Tyr tyrosine Val valine ZnBDD [Zn2(bdc)(D-lac)(dmf)](DMF) ZnBLD [Zn2(bdc)(L-lac)(dmf)](DMF) ZnBND [Zn2(BTC)(NO3)(DMA)3]n ZnCB [Zn2(D-Cam)2(4, 40-bpy)]n ZrO2 zirconia\n(TLC) [7]. Other methods such as crystallization resolution, liquidliquid extraction, and membrane separation are also used for separation or preparation purpose [8].\nEach of these methods has their unique abilities for enantiomeric recognition, separation or quantification. Nevertheless, despite the availability of such advanced enantioseparation methods, it is still difficult to separate the enantiomers with high efficiency because of the intrinsic difficulties due to the exactly same physiochemical properties of the enantiomer pairs [1e4]. In addition, most of them require using chiral columns packed with conventional stationary phases, and such processes are often costly, cumbersomeand lacking in versatility [2,3]. Alternatively, nanoparticles (NPs) with large surface-to-volume ratios and specific physical and chemical properties have a wide range of exploitation in analytical chemistry. These versatile properties enable the development of nanostructure-based tools offering extremely promising improvements in the analytical basic properties of sensitivity, selectivity and reliability in comparison with previous non-nanostructured designs [9]. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are one kind of metal oxides NPs, which can be handled by using an external magnetic field. MNPs provide great potential for applications in efficient solid-phase extraction [10e13], sensitive biomedicine applications [14,15], and selective catalysis [16]. There are several advantages of using magnetic nanomaterials in enantioseparation and related techniques. First, magnetic nanomaterials are superparamagnetic, which means they can be easily separated from sample solutions via an external magnetic field. Second, they can be easily modified with chiral selectors and used as enantioselective adsorbents. Third, they usually possess large surfaces, high adsorption capacity and rapid adsorption rate, so less amounts\nof sorbents and short equilibrium times are required in practical applications. Finally, they can be recycled easily. Chiral adsorbents can be generated by the post modification with chiral selectors on the surface of achiral magnetic nanomaterials. The obtained enantioselective magnetic nanomaterials are expected to interact with every enantiomer, forming locally-chiral structures according to different interactionmechanisms. Differential stability of the two diastereomeric complexes then forms the basis for enantioselective adsorption.\nIn this review, we emphasize the recent progresses of applications of functionalized magnetic nanomaterials in the field of enantioselective separation. MNPs are tagged with an appropriate chiral selector including small molecular compounds, oligomers and polymers. The functionalized magnetic nanomaterials are used for enantioseparation, which interact selectively with target molecules via multiple interactions and can then be easily isolated by an external magnet. Table 1 summarizes works describing the applications of functionalized MNPs for enantioseparation."

      "text" : "The small molecular chiral selector includes AAs and their derivations, metal-ligand and others. Magnetic silica nanoparticles modified by a small molecular chiral selector were demonstrated to be useful in magnetic field induced separation of enantiomers [17]. The enantioseparation process is akin to ‘‘enantioselective fishing’’. Magnetic silica NPs and non-magnetic silica particles with (S)- or (R)-N-(2,2-dimethyl-4-pentanoyl)-proline-3,5dimethylanilide as chiral selectors were prepared in refluxing\nX .D eng et al./ Trends in A nalytical Chem istry 124 (2020) 115804 3\nX .D eng et al./ Trends in A nalytical Chem istry 124 (2020) 115804 4\ntoluene for 72 h and added into the racemic solution for enantioselective adsorption. However, the enantioselectivity was not stratified and consequently another method was developed that employed both the antipode (R)-tagged non-magnetic silica particles and antipode (S)-tagged magnetic silica NPs at the same time. Based on results from chiral HPLC separation, enantioselectivity was improved when non-magnetic silica NPs with (R)chiral selectors was used in conjunction with magnetic silica NPs with (S)-chiral selectors. This work demonstrated that two contrary chiral selectors could have some synergistic effects for enantioseparation and provided novel insight into the development of a high efficiency enantioselective method. Unique chiral ionic liquids can separate numerous racemic compounds due to the formation of hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, steric repulsion, p-p, dipole-dipole, and ionic interactions between chiral ionic liquids and racemates. Liu et al. [18] fabricated novel chiral amino acid ionic liquid modified magnetic nanospheres for the separation of chiral AAs. Chiral ionic liquid 1-ethyl3-methyl-imidazolium L-proline consisting of an imidazolium cation with a natural amino anion was chosen as a functional legend to graft onto the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanospheres by using 1, 6-diisocyanatohexane as the spacer to design more taskspecific chiral magnetic nanospheres. The modified magnetic nanospheres share the high bonded content of the chiral ionic liquid. Complete separation of typtophan (Trp) racemate via the ionic liquid modified magnetic nanospheres was eventually achieved by centrifugal chiral chromatography for the first time.\nMethods currently available for the analysis of enantiomers are based either on separation techniques such as HPLC, CE and GC, or spectroscopic methods such as spectroflourometry. However, separation techniques are limited by the performance of the separation step. On the other hand, chirooptical methods (i.e. optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism) are capable of rapid enantio discrimination without the need of separation, but these methods suffer from relatively low sensitivity. To overcome these issues, Ahmadi et al. [19] synthesized D-(þ)-Trp and/or L-( )-Trp functionalized magnetic nanospheres and used them as probes for the determination of the model enantiomers with the aid of the resonance light scattering method. As a test, naproxen and a-phenylglycine (Phy) were chosen as model chiral compounds. Magnetic nanospheres were prepared and coated with silica and primary amine functional groups by the aid of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane reagent. And then reacted with Try in methanolic suspension with the aid of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide condensation agent. D-Trp modifiedmagnetite nanospheres were very sensitive to R-naproxen and D-a-Phy, and the corresponding resonance light scattering signal was greatly enhanced in the presence of these enantiomers. In contrast, L-Trp modified magnetic nanospheres were sensitive to Snaproxen and L-a-Phy.\nIn recent years, multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with large surface-to-volume ratios and specific physical and chemical properties have attracted attention for their potential application in chiral separation. Tarigh et al. [20] prepared L-threonine (L-Thr) modified magnetic MWCNT by in situ electrostatic adsorption and used it as a newmagnetic chiral selector for the separation of chiral DL-mandelic acid (DL-MA). By varying the pH, DL-MAwas adsorbed on the surface of magnetic chiral selector through hydrogen bonds. HPLC and ultravioletevisible spectroscopy revealed that the L-Thr modified magnetic MWCNT showed stronger complexation of (þ)-enantiomer than ( )-enantiomer. All processes including in situ immobilization, enantioseparation and magnetic separation were done in approximately ten minutes without the need for\nchemical synthesis. The enantioseparation methodology proposed has proved to be simple, reliable, inexpensive, sensitive and reproducible.\nA novel magnetic electrochemical chiral sensor with the assistance of magnetism was developed by Shi et al. [21] for the discrimination and quantitative determination of tyrosine (Tyr) enantiomers. In the fabrication process, the chiral selectorfunctionalized magnetic NPs were achieved by self-assembly anchoring L-cysteine (L-Cys) on the surface of the Au/Fe3O4 nanocomposites (L-Cys-Au/Fe3O4). Ascribing to the synergistic effect of Fe3O4 MNPs and gold NPs as well as the enhancement advantage of the chiral magnetic nanocomposites, the designed electrochemical sensor displayed high electrocatalytic chiral recognition activity toward Tyr enaniomers with larger peak potential separation between the L- and D-Tyr enantiomers. Furthermore, using L-valine (L-Val) as chiral selector, Huang et al. [22] prepared L-Val-functionalized magnetic microspheres by grafting L-Val on polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer-modified magnetic microspheres. The chiral discrimination ability of L-Val-functionalized magnetic microspheres was investigated by determining the enantiomeric excess of dansyl AAs after enantioselective adsorption by L-Val-functionalized magnetic microspheres. The e.e. values of dansyl AAs adsorbed onto the surface of the L-Val-functionalized magnetic microspheres was calculated to be 20.1%, which is better than most relevant works previously reported. Tarhan et al. [23] presented a simple chemical method for the preparation of R(þ)-amethylbenzylamine modified MNPs with 3- glycidoxypropyldimethoxymethylsilane as condensation agent and assessed this as a new enantioselective solid phase sorbent for separation of MA enantiomers from aqueous solutions.\nDopamine can self-polymerize under alkaline conditions to generate polydopamine (PDA), which is a mimic of the specialized adhesive foot protein that can modify almost all material surfaces. Electrochemical detection of L-Cys was greatly improved in recent years with simpler methods of high sensitivity. However, the rapid and portable identification and quantification of D-Cys is still limited. Specifically, Cys is a thiol-containing amino acid and can bindwithmanymetal ions, such as Cu2þ, Agþ, Au3þ, Cd3þ, and Pb2þ, via the strong interaction with its thiol group. More interestingly, the on-rate of D-type and L-type Cys to the metal ions is evenly matched. However, the stability of the binding is widely different between the enantiomers, D-type being more stable (slower offrate) than the L-type. Inspired by these reports, Zhou et al. [24] used this unique difference to develop a highly sensitive electrochemical chiral sensor for Cys based on Fe3O4@PDA/CuxO MNPs as electrode units. D-Cys-Cu2þ-D-Cys formed in the presence of Cys exhibits strong stability and a shielding effect on the redox current of indicator Cu2þ, which can be used to quantify and recognize DCys by square wave voltammetry (Fig. 1). The proposed method has been verified by real sample analysis with satisfactory results.\nSelective crystallization represents one of the most economical and convenientmethods to provide large-scale optically pure chiral compounds. Ye et al. [25] presented an enantiomer-selectivemagnetization strategy for quantitatively separating the crystals of conglomerates by using a kind of magnetic nano-splitters. These nano-splitters would be selectively wrapped into the S-crystals, leading to the formation of the crystals with different physical properties from that of R-crystals (Fig. 2). As a result of efficient separation under magnetic field, high purity chiral compounds (e.e. values of 99.2% for R-crystals, e.e. values of 95.0% for S-crystals)can be obtained in a simple one-step crystallization process with a separation yield as high as 95.1%. Compared to traditional methods,\nthis strategy doesn't require special equipment or any chemical transformation process. However, this strategy only works in the case of conglomerates at this stage."

      "heading" : "3.1. Oligosaccharides",
      "text" : "CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides containing six, seven, or eight Dglucose units bound via a-1,4-glycosidic linkages, which are widely used in enantioseparation. Chen et al. [26] presented a more efficient and economical enantioseparation of AAs enantiomers by using a b-CD modified Fe3O4 nanospheres as a chiral selecting system. The b-CD modified Fe3O4 nanospheres were prepared by simple one-pot synthesis procedures. Furthermore, photocontrolled inclusion and exclusion reaction of azobenzene derivatives with b-CDwere used to induce the release of the adsorbed enantiomers from the MNPs and lead to their repetitious recycle application in enantioseparation. The specific rotation of the resulting solution was found to be 34.6, which is close to that of pure L-Try solutions. Using a facile and controllable in situ chemical deposition strategy, graphene oxide (GO)-magnetic nanocomposites were prepared, and then used as supporting materials for the adsorption of chiral selector of b-CD [27]. Thus formed b-CD conjugated GO-magnetic nanocomposites (GO/Fe3O4/b-CD) were localized in the pre-nominated position in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)microchannels with the help of externalmagnets. Adopting in-column amperometric detection, the successful chiral separation of Trp enantiomers was achieved in less than 50 s in the opentubular capillary electromatography (OT-CEC) mode.\nFunctional modification of CD will affect its enantioselective adsorption ability. Novel b-CD derivatives with different functionalities have been prepared, namely, amide, ether or amine b-CD [28], carboxymethyl-b-CD (CM-b-CD) [29e31], maleic anhydrideb-CD [32], cationic-b-CD [33], thiolated-b-CD [34,35] and b-CD on\npolymers [35e40]. Then these b-CD derivatives grafted onto the surface of iron oxide NPs to provide an method for enantioseparation. Specifically, functionalized MNPs were prepared by grafting of carboxymethyl-b-CD (CM-b-CD) on Fe3O4/SiO2 MNPs via modified carbodiimide activation method [29,30]. These MNPs were scrutinized for adsorption of certain chiral aromatic amino acid enantiomers and adsorption-equilibrium experiments demonstrated that the adsorption capacities were higher for L-enantiomers than the corresponding D-enantiomers. This study provided proof of concept for a chiral recognition mechanism of aromatic AAs by CM-b-CD bonded magnetic silica particles as selective sorbent. Coated capillary with CM-b-CD functionalized magnetic microparticles as stationary phase was prepared by Sun et al. [31] and applied for enantioseparation of several racemic drugs (propranolol, ofloxacin, amlodipine, chlortrimeton, tropicamide, and atenolol) by capillary electrochromatography (CEC).\nA specific chiral magnetic-nanobiofluids (mNBFs) based on an aqueous dispersion of cobalt ferrite loaded with gold NPs carrying a thiolated b-CD (b-CD-SH/Au/CoFe2O4-NPs) were synthesized and used for the supramolecular discrimination of Trp enantiomers at a graphene paste transducer via cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3) [32]. The established electrochemical methodology not only discriminates between L-Trp and D-Trp enantiomers, but also between single enantiomers and racemic mixtures. Recently, our group [33] fabricated chiral Fe3O4@SiO2/Au/b-CD composites by selfassembling thiolated b-CD onto the surface of magnetic Au@SiO2@Fe3O4 composites via Au-thiol bonding. The assynthesized chiral composites were then used for the direct enantioselective adsorption of MA enantiomers. The experimental data indicated that magnetic Fe3O4@SiO2/Au/b-CD composites show higher chiral selectivity toward R-MA than that of S-MA.\nAs widely used b-CD derivatives, polymerized CDs usually provide superior enantioselectivity to native CDs because of different structural conformations, chain lengths and increasing number of cavities. Huang et al. [34] firstly prepared dispersible SiO2\n@Fe3O4microspheres by using classical solvothermal synthesis and st€ober method. Then the poly(N,N0-methylene bisacrylamide) @Fe3O4microsphereswerepreparedby thedistillationprecipitation polymerization approach. Finally, the maleic anhydride b-CD modified Fe3O4 microspheres were prepared by free radical polymerization and subsequently used for enantioseparation. The thus prepared chiral materials showed stronger complexation with ( )-enantiomers than (þ)-enantiomers, and stronger enantioselective adsorption for double ring chiral compounds. In comparison with native b-CD, cationic b-CD derivatives have been demonstrated to be more powerful chiral selectors because of their superior chiral recognition abilities caused by the additional electrostatic interaction between cationic charged b-CD and oppositely charged analyte enantiomers. The same group [35] also developed a novel class of chiral selectors by immobilization of vinylimidazolium-b-CD chloride on 3-methacryloxy propyltrimethoxysilane-modified iron oxide magnetic microspheres through a radical polymerization. The prepared vinylimidazolium-b-CD chloride immobilized magnetic\nmicrosphereswere thenutilized for the selective chiral absorptionof three dansyl AAs. The results indicated that the functionalized chiral magnetic microspheres showed excellent recyclability, stronger interactions with the L-enantiomers during the chiral adsorption process. They [36] prepared b-CD-polymer-modified Fe3O4 microspheres usinga one-pothydrothermal reactionandapplied these for stereoselective adsorption of DL-Trp enantiomers. The results suggested that the functionalized magnetic microspheres absorbed more L-Trp and had excellent chiral discrimination ability.\nMultifunctional MNPs simultaneously possessing thermoresponsive properties and chiral recognition ability show great potential in enantiomeric separation. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) is a well-known thermosensitive polymer, which can undergo conformational change at the lower critical solution temperature of about 32 C. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) shows a hydrophobic shrunken state at temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature, while it exhibits a hydrophilic swollen state when temperature decreases below the lower critical solution temperature. A\ncombination of b-CD molecules with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) polymer chains allows the fabrication of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-CD polymer system, which not only possesses chiral recognition ability to guest molecules, but also has excellent thermo-responsive properties. Most importantly, the phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in response to the temperature change can dramatically affect the inclusion constants of b-CD toward guest molecules in the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-CD system [37]. Inspired by those interesting results, a novel type of multifunctional Fe3O4MNPs, decoratedwith smart polymer brushes consisting of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PNG) chains with pendent b-CD units (Fe3O4@PNG-CD or Fe3O4@PDA@PNG-CD), was fabricated as a chiral nanoselector for the thermo-sensitive selective adsorption and separation of amino acid enantiomers [38,39]. Via simply changing the operation temperature, the decomplexation of amino acid enantiomers and regeneration of the smart chiral MNPs can be easily achieved. Guo et al. [40] recently reported a novel type of multifunctional microspheres, which were composed of a Fe3O4 NPs core, an acidicresistant SiO2 middle shell and a thermosensitive microgel\nfunctional shell molecules (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-maleic anhydride-b-CD), PNCD). The fabricated smart chiral magnetic microspheres (Fe3O4@Si2O@PNCD) demonstrated fascinating temperature-responsive chiral recognition and adsorption selectivity toward Trp enentiomers. Most importantly, the desorption of Trp enantiomers and the regeneration of the Fe3O4@Si2O@PNCD can be easily achieved via simply changing the operation temperature (Fig. 4)."

Our group [41] recently reported the simple and economical protocol for the preparation of enantioselective magnetic Fe3O4 MPs (Fe3O4@PDA@TE) by utilizing PDA layer as a multifunctional platform for the modification of TE. The enantioselectivity of the resulting materials was validated by one-step ormulti-step adsorption experiments for representative enantiomers (D, L-Trp, D, L-Phe, and D, L- Tyr).\nExperimental results proved that the new chiral materials had good performance in terms of preparative enantioseparation and could be reused for at least three times.Using TE as chiral selector, Wu et al. [42] fabricated TE-conjugated mesoporous silica MNPs by using1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate as a crosslinker to connect the primary amine groups in both mesoporous silica MNPs and TE. The synthesized TE-modified mesoporous silica MNPs were effective in direct chiral separation of five racemic compounds and exhibited stronger interaction with (þ)-enantiomers."

      "text" : "Cellulose derivatives, such as the phenylcarbamates and benzoates of cellulose, show high chiral recognition to a broad range of chiral compounds and have been widely used as chiral stationary phase for HPLC to separate enantiomers. Huang et al. [43] introduced the application of electrospinning to prepare magnetic enantioselective materials. In this approach, a precursor solution was prepared by suspending Fe3O4 particles into cellulose tris-(4methylbenzoate) (CTMB) solution in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), followed by electrospinning to produce Fe3O4@CTMB microparticles. The enantioselectivity of the adsorbents was evaluated using racemic ibuprofen as a model drug; the e.e. values derived from the supernatant and the elution were 4.78 and 1.93% in a single adsorption stage, respectively, indicating that Fe3O4@CTMB interacted more strongly with S-ibuprofen than R-ibuprofen. Wei et al. [44] fabricated a chiral magnetic material by immobilizing cellulose-2,3-bis(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (CBDMPC) onto the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 microspheres through the spacer of 1,6- diisocyanatohexane. Direct separation of different racemates on the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2@CBDMPC microspheres was conducted and analyzed using automatic digital polarimetry. The separation results suggested that CMMs showed much stronger interaction with ( )-isomer than (þ)-isomer, thereby demonstrating its\nfeasibility as a potential material for chiral separation. In the process of enantioseparation, low separation resolutions of racemates were always observed, possibly due to non-uniformity of the size of nanomaterials and/or masking of active chiral center by impurities. To increase the separation resolution of racemate, the same group [45] proposed a centrifugal field flow fractionation separation method for the purification of the chiral magnetic microspheres to obtain Fe3O4@SiO2@CBDMPC microspheres with a uniform size distribution and greatly reduced impurities. Chiral separation was then performed to resolve benzoin racemate with narrow tubing coiled around a cylindrical magnet, which was used to retain the magnetic chiral selector as a stationary phase. The benzoin racemate was successfully enantio separated with a peak resolution of 1.5. Optimal separationwas achievedwith a 2.1mL capacity column using ethanol at the flow rate of 0.1 mL/min under dry ice. An inert surface layer (chemical, thermal and mechanical stability) with compatible surface chemistry is ideal for specific targeting. Zirconia (ZrO2) has been shown to be the most stable oxide mechanically, thermally and chemically, and it also shows optimal physical and chemical properties among inorganic metal oxides. Cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (CDMPC) immobilized Fe3O4@ZrO2 magnetic microspheres (Fe3O4@ZrO2@CDMPC) were prepared by simple surface adsorption coating for direct chiral separation of racemic drugs [46]. The authors found that the chiral ZrO2 magnetic microspheres were potential chiral nanomaterials for enantioseparation. Importantly, the synthesized displayed excellent recyclability and could be used for chiral separation of many kinds of racemates."

      "text" : "The inherent chirality of biomacromolecules, including nucleic acids, peptides and proteins, has exhibited intriguing applications as chiral stationary phase for HPLC. For example, serum albumin functionalized magnetic nanomaterials holds significant promise for enantioseparation due to its special recognition sites for chiral\ndrugs. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) anchored on the surface of poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) functionalized magnetic Fe3O4 NPs were prepared via electrostatic adsorption and used as a chiral selector for separation of chiral drug enantiomers [47]. For racemic ibuprofen and ofloxacin, single-step adsorption provided e.e. values of 13% and 14%, respectively. To increase the stationary phase ratio and surface area in classical CEC or microchip electrophoresis (MCE), different matrices such as NPs, sol-gel, and porous membranes have been employed to immobilize or adsorb a larger number of chiral selectors. Among them, Au-coated MNPs with large surface areas exhibit both the fast magnetic responsively of the magnetic core and excellent biocompatibility of the Au shell. These properties provide a good platform for further conjugation of biomolecules of interest and facilitate extension of the applications of both Au NPs and magnetic NPs in biomedical fields. Liang et al. [48] presented the first application of BSA conjugated Fe3O4@Au NPs as a novel stationary phase of MCE for efficient enantioseparation. The electrochromatographic enantioselectivity and reproducibility of the constructed MCE microdevice were validated by chiral separation of amino acid enantiomers. The successful separation of Trp, threonine, and ofloxacin enantiomers was obtained with resolution factor of 1.67, 1.79, and 2.15, respectively. Recently, it has been shown that BSA can form a stable nanocomposite with GO through hydrophobic, p-p stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding between the oxygen functional groups of GO and nitrogen/ oxygen-containing groups on BSA [49]. Further extension of magnetic properties onto graphene could combine the high adsorption capacity of the graphene and the manipulation convenience of the magnetic materials. Using BSA as chiral selector, the same group [50] presented the first application of BSA conjugated graphenebased magnetic nanocomposites (GO/Fe3O4/BSA) as a novel stationary phase of OT-CEC for efficient enantioseparation. In the first step, GO/Fe3O4 nanocomposites were prepared by in situ chemical precipitation process. Then BSA was immobilized on the nanocomposites through hydrophobic, p-p stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. For the last step, the resultant GO/Fe3O4/BSA conjugates were then locally packed into PDMS microchannels with the help of external magnets. Using a separation length of 37 mm coupled with in column amperometric detection, the successful separation of Trp, threonine, and propranolol enantiomers were achieved in less than 80 s with resolution of 1.22, 1.9 and 2.1 respectively. Wang et al. [51] firstly prepared a new class of PAMAM-MNPs via microwave-assisted method, and then used it for the immobilization of BSAusing glutaraldehyde as crosslinker to form chiral MNPs Fe3O4@SiO2@PAMAM-BSA. It was found that the binding capacity of BSA to Fe3O4@SiO2@PAMAM increased with each generation of PAMAM dendrimer growth, which can enhance the chiral discrimination ability of final chiral materials to racemates, such as AAs. The separation results also indicated that the Fe3O4@SiO2@PAMAM-BSA thus prepared showed much greater affinities for the ( )-enantiomers than the (þ)-enantiomers. In another work,Wu et al. [52] from the same research group reported the preparation of PAMAM dendrimer-modified Fe3O4@SiO2 microspheres and immobilization of HSA on Fe3O4@SiO2@PAMAM to form a magnetic chiral nano-selector using the same strategy. The resulting HSA immobilized Fe3O4@SiO2@PAMAM was applied in the direct chiral separation of racemic drugs. The separation results obtained by CE indicated that HSA immobilized on thirdgeneration PMSM possessed excellent chiral separation capability and biocompatibility. Hemoglobin provides several specific recognition sites for binding many pharmaceutical and biological chiral compounds. Bagheri et al. [53] prepared a synthetic chiral magnetic nanoselector by immobilizing bovine hemoglobin on modified silica coated MNPs. The hemoglobin immobilized silica-coated MNPs were employed for preconcentration of L-Trp in the\npresence of D-Trp, followed by spectrofluorometric determination of L-Trp after desorption with acetonitrile/HCl eluent. Synthesized adsorbent is distinct in terms of sensitivity and selectivity toward the investigated analyte. In CEC, magnetic particles are packed in a fused silica capillary by use of a magnetic field to be retained without frits. Okamoto et al. [54] prepared avidin functionalized magnetic particles and applied these for chiral separation of ketoprofen. Avidin was immobilized onto the surface of the magnetic particles by using the physical adsorption technique. The prepared magnetic materials were subsequently packed in a fused silica capillary by a magnetic field. The fritless avidin immobilized magnetic particles packed capillary allowed for chiral separation of ketoprofen with a packing length of only 5 cm. However, the packed fritless capillaries are currently unable to achieve optimal analytical performance due to decreased packing density, the difference in the electroosmotic flow rate between packed and open regions, and the inhomogeneity in the size and surface charge of the avidin immobilized magnetic particles. Further work (e.g. electroosmotic flow control in the capillary, characteristics of packed materials, packing length, etc.) is likely to improve this CEC medium. Electrochemical immunoassay, which possesses the advantages of potential portability, low cost and high sensitivity, has been well developed and widely used in recent years [55]. Zhang et al. [56] demonstrated an effective electrochemical immunosensor for chiral resolution of amlodipine, which was based on highly enantioselective antibody modified magnetic beads and a magnetic electrode. The magnetic electrode was modified by an immunoconjugate which was prepared by coupling magnetic beads with antibody against S-amlodipine and used as the capture probe. The antibody modified magnetic beads immunoconjugate could be used to modify the magnetic electrode quickly and firmly by magnetic adsorption. S-amlodipine was recognized and captured by specific antibody-antigen reaction. The collected enantiomers were ultra-pure based on the chiral HPLC identification. Li et al. [57] proposed a new strategy for efficiently separating chiral compounds, i.e., stereoselectively hydrolyzing the individual enantiomer of racemates via enzyme, followed by a simple magnetic separation using Fe3O4 NPs. MNPs of Fe3O4@SiO2eNH2eCOOH composites were designed and synthesized for the amidation reaction with the hydrolyzed d-aminoacids from the mixture. With the help of a magnetic field, d-form AAs can be readily separated at a large scale. The e.e. values are 75% and 98% for racemic N-acyl-Phe and methionine, respectively."

      "text" : "Molecular imprinting is an attractive method in chiral separation for their high selectivity. Qu et al. [58] synthesized molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) coated MNPs (MIP-MNPs) and used these MIP-MNPs as stationary phase in the microchannel of a microfluidic device for rapid enantioseparation by CEC. Under optimized conditions, baseline separation of ofloxacin enantiomers was obtained within 195 s with good reproducibility and detection precision. Compared to conventional chiral separation, the prepared MIP-MNPs could be conveniently localized to the pre-nominated position in the channel by an external magnetic field and the length of the packing zone could be easily varied by changing the length of the magnet. Several studies on the preparation of MIP materials based on the self-polymerization of monomer dopamine have been reported. For example, a facile approach for preparation of mussel-inspired imprinted Fe3O4@PDA NPs was developed and used as chiral stationary phase for rapid enantioseparation by OTCEC [59]. This one-step synthesis method eliminated the use of toxic organic agents and exhibited a rapid, efficient and environmentally-friendly approach to fabricate MIP magnetic\nnanomaterials. In addition, the prepared imprinted Fe3O4@PDANPs possessed high binding capacity and good enantioselectivity. In an effort to further increase the versatility of this strategy, norepinephrine, a derivative of dopamine, was used as functional monomer in the presence of molecular template for preparation of imprinted Fe3O4@polynorepinephrine NPs (MIP-Fe3O4@PNE NPs). The prepared magnetic nanomaterials were packed in a PDMS microchannel by the help of an external magnetic field as stationary phase for multiplex enantioseparation of target analytes. This method has substantial potential for chiral high-throughput screening and real time process control [60]. The method for multiple enantio recognitions with the same MIP-Fe3O4@PNE NPsbased MCE could also be extended virtually to other chiral compounds by simply switching the corresponding template molecules [61]. Using Fe3O4@Au NPs modified with 6-mercapto-b-CD as carrier, cinchonine as template molecule, methacrylic acid as a functional monomer and N,N0-methylenebisacrylamide as a crossslinking agent, a novel MIP electrochemiluminence sensor for detecting chiral cinchonine molecules was developed with a MIP membrane on the surfaces on magnetic microspheres [62]. Cinchonine was specifically recognized by the 6-mercapto-b-CD functional MIP, and the enhancement of the electrochemiluminescene intensity was caused by the reaction of tertiary amino structures of cinchonine molecules with Ru(bpy)32þ. Optically active polymers have received increasing attention in polymer science because they possess elegant structure and unique properties which cannot be observed in ordinary polymers. As far as chirality is concerned, synthetic optically active polymers with\nFig. 5. Schematic illustration for preparing the optically active, magnetic Fe3O4@ polyacet from Royal Society of Chemistry.\nunique “chiral amplification” effects may provide superior candidates for chiral recognition/resolution. Based on chiral polymers from substituted polyacetylene (PA) helical polymers, a series of optically active polymer modified magnetic composite microspheres/gels were prepared (Fig. 5) and used for chiral separation and enantioselective crystallization [63e67]. The composite magnetic materials combined optical activity derived from polymers and magneticity originated from the Fe3O4 NPs. More importantly, these could be easily separated with the help of an external magnet thereby allowing for their convenient recycling and reuse. Particles with tunable morphology promote scientific and technological advances due to their distinctive properties and uses. Li et al. [68] from the same group reported a novel strategy for constructing hybrid particles with tunable morphology through embedding inorganic components (GO and/or Fe3O4 NPs) inside chiral helical PA. The intense circular dichroism effects demonstrate that the hybrid particles possess remarkable optical activity. The use of the chiral magnetic hybrid particles in enantioselective crystallization of racemic Phe also experimentally demonstrates the kind of particles' significant potential applications in chiral separation. Fig. 6 illustrates the overall strategy for preparing the hybrid particles with tunable morphology by embedding GO and (or) Fe3O4 NPs. The same group [69] also reported the first synthesis of porous, optically active, magnetic Fe3O4@poly(N-acryloyl-leucine) inverse core/shell composite microspheres, in which the core was constructed of chiral polymer and the shell was constructed of Fe3O4 NPs. To explore the chiral recognition ability of the prepared magnetic composite microspheres, (R)-(þ)- and (S)-( )-1-\nylene (Fe3O4@PA) core/shell microspheres. Reprinted from Ref. [66] with permission\nphenylethylamine were used as model chiral compounds to be recognized. It was experimentally found the maximum adsorption of (R)-(þ)-1-phenylethylamine and (S)-( )-1- phenylethylamine was 33.0% and 17.5%, respectively."

      "text" : "MOFs known as porous material with periodic network structure, are crystalline materials formed by the self-assembly of inorganic metal centers (metal ions or metal clusters) and bridged organic ligands [70]. MOFs combine the rigidity of inorganic materials with the flexibility of organic materials. A homochiral MOF material, [Zn2(bdc)(L-lac)(dmf)](DMF)(ZnBLD) or [Zn2(bdc)(Dlac)(dmf)](DMF)(ZnBDD), was selected for the preparation of magnetic homochiral MOFs. Chang et al. [71] synthesized magnetic functionalized homochiral MOFs material (Fe3O4@SiO2-ZnBLD or Fe3O4@SiO2-ZnBDD) by adding Fe3O4@SiO2 particles into the DMF solution of Zn(NO3)2, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylici acid (bdc) and Llactic acid (L-lac) or D-lactic acid (D-lac). The prepared Fe3O4@SiO2ZnBLD or Fe3O4@SiO2-ZnBDD composites were expected to select a single enantiomer from the racemic methyl phenyl sulfoxidesolution. This process can be vividly called “enantioselective fishing”. The enantiomer separation results demonstrated that Fe3O4@SiO2-ZnBLD and Fe3O4@SiO2-ZnBDD composites showed much higher preference for the (S)-enenatiomer or (R)-enantiomer with an e.e. values of 85.2% and 86.2%, respectively. It is intriguing to mingle the porous homochiral MOFs as chiral selectors with\ngraphene nanosheets to efficiently screen enantiomers for drug enantioseparations. Ma et al. [72] prepared a novel magnetic GOMOF [Zn2(D-Cam)2(4,40-bpy)]n (MGO-ZnCB) as a sorbent for fast, simple and enantioselective capture of chiral drug intermediates of 1, 10-bi-2-naphthol and 2, 20-furoin. Good enantioselective separation of these compounds was obtained with e.e. values as high as 74.8% and 57.4%, respectively. Furthermore, they [73] also prepared two PDA-coated magnetic GO-homochiral MOF [Cu(L-mal)(bpy)]$ H2O (MGO-CuLBH) and [Cu(D-mal)(bpy)]$H2O (MGO-CuDBH). These two nanocomposites were applied as sorbents to the enantioselective capture of racemic propranolol hydrochloride enantiomers and the e.e. values reached up to 98%. Multi-stage operations using MGO-CuLBH and MGO-CuDBH were scaled up to obtain milligram quantities of R-propranolol hydrochloride and Spropranolol hydrochloride. Using similar preparation process, Gao et al. [74] from the same research group also prepared and characterized a novel magnetic GO-MOF [Zn2(BTC)(NO3)(DMA)3]n(MGO-ZnBND). The enantioselective performance of MGOZnBND was then evaluated by magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction of 2,20-furoin and benzoin racemic solutions. Under the optimum conditions, e.e. values as high as 85% and 66% were achieved for 2,20-furoin and benzoin, respectively. After washing with methanol, MGO-ZnBND could be easily recycle and reused six times without any apparent loss of performance, demonstrating good stability and reusability of this kind of material. However, achieving entire separation of the drug enantiomers based on MGO-MOF remains a great challenge."

      "text" : "Magnetic nanomaterials with large surface area and specific chemical and physical properties have shown great potential in analytical chemistry. Magnetic nanomaterials modified with chiral selectors such as AAs, CDs, celluloses, proteins, synthetic polymers and others, have been used in enantioseparation. The magnetic nanocomposites were applied to selectively capture enantiomers in a rapid way using a magnet, which appreciably boosted up both efficiency and selectivity in the relevant protocol.\nIn this review, several novel configurations and preparation methods for MNPs composites and their applications as versatile and highly selective tools in enantioseparation have been comprehensively summarized. These approaches make the process of analysis more selective, more sensitive, and more economic. It was observed that since last 5 years, many novel studies have been reported on these approaches. Though a number of chiral separation methods have been developed (e.g. OT-CEC, chiral HPLC and CE), further research to increase the speed and lower the cost of enantioseparation is still necessary. Additionally, the difficulty of achieving complete enantioseparation in a single step with functionalized magnetic nanomaterials needs to be addressed. Polymer modified magnetic nanomaterials and magnetic MOFs composites that improve the loading capability of chiral selector and separation selectivity may be particularly useful in this regard.\nAt the present time, combination of conventional enantioseparation techniques with the recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology is proving to be quite exciting by producing synergetic results. Despite all these developments, the major challenge that still remains is the development of a more flexible, efficient and economic chiral resolution technique and/or chiral selector to efficiently separate the numerous chiral compounds, Future MNPsbased studies and developments may focus on the following areas: (I) proposing new configurations for the synthesis of magnetic composites sorbents and the exploitation of chiral selector with responsive functionalities with higher selectivity to develop the application range of these materials; (II) the introduction of smarter techniques with more universal abilities for enantiomeric sensing, recognition, and separation.\nAuthor statement\nDeng Xiaojuan: Conceptualization, Writing- Original draft preparation.\nLi Wenbin: Investigation.

    "abstractText" : "Enantioselective separation is significantly important for the study of pharmacology and biology, but it is still a big challenge because of the identical physical and chemical properties of enantiomers in an achiral environment. Magnetic nanomaterials have unique properties such as extremely large surface area per volume substance and strong magnetic response. It is very easy for them to be isolated from complicated matrixes, only by applying external magnets. The possibilities for surface functionalization make them exciting candidates for enantioseparation. Functionalized magnetic nanomaterials are unique tools for the simple and rapid enantioseparation compared with traditional chiral stationary phase. In this review, various magnetic nanomaterials modified with specific chiral selectors are reviewed in this manuscript. The prepared functional magnetic materials are typically used as chiral adsorbents for enantioseparation applications, formatted by methods of dispersive solid phase extraction, enantioselective crystallization, or column and microchip separation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
